Campbell Soup nears $500M deal to sell Bolthouse Farms:::::Getting cash out of Campbell Soup may be tougher than... Six months after it kicked off its auction to sell its Bolthouse Farms juice business, Campbell Soup is close to a sale for about $500 million, sources said.Private equity firm Butterfly Equity has teamed with one-time Bolthouse Farms CEO Jeffrey Dunn to buy the Bolthouse brand, which sells juices, sources tell The Post confirming a Wall Street Journal report.Butterfly Equity was founded by former KKR principal Adam Waglay, and Dustin Beck, an entrepreneur.Campbell started to sell its US fresh food assets six months ago as part of its successful campaign to win a proxy fight against shareholder activist Dan Loeb.A Campbell spokeswoman told The Post in November there was strong interest in Bolthouse and its Garden Fresh Gourmet brands.But a banker on Thursday said that the sale took longer than usual because potential buyers questioned Bolthouses $45 million in earnings that included many adjustments.A Campbell spokeswoman declined comment.
Disney reveals when Disney+ will launch, what it will cost:::::Disney on Thursday finally unveiled how it will compete in the streaming video business now ruled by Netflix.The Mouse House gave media types and investors a first look at Disney+ its family friendly video streaming service at its annual investors day on Thursday.It will start Nov. 12 and cost subscribers $6.99 a month The companys foray into streaming has been a top priority for Disney boss Bob Iger as Disney+ is being launched into a saturated market dominated by Netflix and Amazon.Tech giant Apple has also announced plans to launch its own streaming service later this year.Deciding how to navigate this was not easy for us, said Iger, who spoke on stage at Disneys Burbank, Calif., headquarters.Calling it an exciting and challenging time for Disney, Iger said the service will be built around five Disney properties: Disney, Pixar, Marvel, LucasFilm and assets it acquired from Twenty-First Century Fox, like National Geographic.It will be the only place to stream Disneys biggest movies after theyve run in theaters.It will include original content, too.Wall Street analysts buzzed on Twitter that the service would be a must buy for anyone with kids.While showcasing Disney+s simple yet sleek interface, Kevin Mayer, Disneys chairman of direct-to-consumer and international service, said consumers will likely get a discount if they agreed to buy Disney+ in a bundle with other Disney properties, including ESPN+ and Hulu.Disney, which acquired a 60% stake in Hulu through its $71 billion acquisition of Fox, did not offer details on the price of Disney+ or the bundle.
Uber reveals it has 91M users in IPO filing:::::Uber on Thursday filed publicly with the Securities and Exchange Commission for its IPO, taking it a step closer to one of the largest technology stock listings of all time.The Uber filing gives the first comprehensive financial picture of the ride-hailing and transportation services company.Started in 2009 after its founders struggled to get a cab on a snowy night, Uber has changed the way millions of people travel and commute but continues to lose money.The filing revealed Uber had 91 million users on its platforms at the end of 2018.Uber set a placeholder amount of $1 billion but did not specify the size of the IPO.Reuters reported this week that Uber plans to sell around $10 billion worth of stock at a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion.Investment bankers had previously told Uber it could be worth as much as $120 billion.Uber will follow smaller rival Lyft in going public, and both companies have reported massive losses.Uber said in its filing it expects operating expenses to increase significantly in the foreseeable future and cautioned it may not achieve profitability.There are also questions about how Uber will navigate any transition toward self-driving vehicles, a technology which is seen as potentially dramatically lowering costs but which could also disrupt its business model.After making the public filing, Uber will begin a series of investor presentations, called a roadshow, which Reuters has reported will start the week of April 29.The company is on track to price its IPO and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May.One advantage Uber will likely seek to play up to investors is that they are the largest player in many of the markets in which it operates.Analysts consider building scale at a critical mass is crucial in order for Ubers business model to become profitable.In addition to questions about its finances, Uber Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the companys culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.Khosrowshahi joined Uber in 2017 from Expedia Inc to replace company co-founder Travis Kalanick who was ousted as CEO.Uber last year had revenue of $11.3 billion, while gross bookings from rides was $50 billion.But the company lost $3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its overseas business units in Russia and Southeast Asia.
Tesla denies report of a spending halt at Nevada plant:::::Tesla is disputing a Thursday report that the electric auto manufacturer is putting a freeze on its plans to expand its Nevada Gigafactory.Both Tesla and Panasonic continue to invest substantial funds into Gigafactory, a Tesla spokesperson told The Post in a statement, referring to electronics maker Panasonic, which is Teslas battery cell supplier.We believe there is far more output to be gained from improving existing production equipment than there was previously estimated.The electric automaker, run by billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, made the comment in response to a report by Japanese news service Nikkei that said Tesla and Panasonic were pulling back on plans to increase the capacity of its plant, which supplies battery packs for the electric vehicles.The report had Tesla shares trading down 3% on Thursday, and added fuel to investors concerns regarding the demand for Tesla vehicles.Giving no indication of its sources, Nikkei reported that financial issues had led the companies to rethink plans to expand the capacity of Gigafactory 1 by another 50% next year.The paper said the companies had already together invested $4.5 billion in the facility and had been planning to expand the plants capacity to the equivalent of 54 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year in 2020 from 35 GWh at present.Tesla said it is focused on upgrading existing lines in its factories, which will achieve the same output as its originally planned investment.Tesla added that, contrary to Nikkeis report, our demand for cells continues to outpace supply and remains a fundamental constraint on Tesla production.Still, experts are keeping a close eye on Tesla as it continues to demonstrate soft sales.Shares fell 11% last week after a bigger-than-expected drop in first-quarter deliveries.It says it will deliver between 360,000 and 400,000 vehicles in 2019.We were skeptical of their 2019 sales guidance to begin with, so [the report] reinforces what we were expecting, CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson tells The Post.It could be a precursor of them lowering their 2019 sales guidance.Tesla shares finished the day down 2.8%, at $268.42.With Reuters
Big3 league accuses Charter of manipulating Disney auction:::::Big3 Basketball the pickup league co-founded by rapper Ice Cube accused cable giant Charter Communications of playing dirty tricks in an auction of Disneys regional sports networks.Big3 claimed Thursday that Charter, 25 percent owned by Liberty Media, is trying to pollute the bidding process by preemptively threatening to drop the so-called RSN channels from its cable networks, which include Spectrum in New York City.In a Thursday response, Charter stopped short of denying the hardball tactics.Charter currently has an agreement to carry these networks and welcomes the opportunity to discuss a future carriage agreement for these networks with whomever ultimately owns them including Big3, Charter said.The explosive allegations come as Disney faces a mid-June deadline to sell the 22 RSNs that were previously owned by Fox in order to clear antitrust concerns raised by its $71.3 billion merger with Fox.Last month, the Yankees teamed with Amazon and Sinclair to buy the YES Network for $3.5 billion.In addition to Charter and Big3, Major League Baseball and Sinclair Broadcasting Group are said to be circling the remaining 21 RSNs.Binding bids are due Monday.On Wednesday, Big3 wrote to both the Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission, claiming that Charter had disseminated its threat to drop the RSNs to other members of the industry, thereby suppressing auction prices, chilling bidding, and ultimately hurting Disneys ability to secure the best price for the RSNs.Regardless of who owns the programming, we approach all negotiations with the same singular objective of reaching carriage agreements that best meet the needs of our customers, Charter said in its Thursday response.In a fiery statement that carried racial overtones, Big3 on Thursday likewise accused Charter of conspiring with its largest shareholder, John Malones Liberty Media the owner of the Atlanta Braves to block Big3 as a diverse and inclusive competitor.Reps for Disney didnt immediately respond to requests for comment.Big3 is the 3-on-3 professional basketball league founded two years ago by Cube and entertainment veteran Jeff Kwatinetz.In its letter to the FCC, Big3 wrote that its vision is to create a network on which the RSNs provide 24/7 programming, supplementing sporting events with broader cultural and political topics and adding an inclusive voice to the national media landscape.
Billionaire Ron Burkle isn’t buying National Enquirer: spokesman:::::News that David Peckers American Media Inc. has put the National Enquirer on the block has triggered a furious guessing game as to who might step out of the shadows and buy the embattled supermarket tabloid.Among the rumored names to surface is billionaire investor Ron Burkle, who is already a junior partner with American Media in its RadarOnline digital gossip site.The New York Times on Thursday said reps for the Enquirer are deep in their negotiations with Burkle, whose close ties with President Bill Clinton could rankle President Donald Trump, who is tight with Pecker.But Burkles reps adamantly deny that they are involved.We are not buying it, a spokesman for Burkle and his private equity company Yucaipa Companies told The Post on Thursday.AMI on Wednesday announced that the tabloid is on the brink of being sold in the wake of numerous scandals tied to its role in the 2016 presidential election.The company told federal prosecutors last year that it helped silence a former Playboy model who claims to have had a long-running affair with Trump leading up to the election.The payments were made in violation of campaign finance laws, the feds said.Under pressure from AMIs biggest investor, Chatham Asset Management, the owner of US Weekly, Mens Journal and Star Magazine kicked off a strategic review in August.On Wednesday, it said it has decided to sell the Enquirer and two smaller supermarket tabloids, the Globe and the National Examiner.Other names to surface as bidders include Paul Pope, the son of National Enquirer founder Generoso Pope Jr., who has hoped to one day regain control of the property, which the Pope estate sold in 1988 for $412.5 million.Pope could not be reached on Thursday, but he has become a vocal critic of the company in recent weeks over to its feud with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who said in February that AMI tried to extort him using compromising photos sent between him and his mistress.Its a great shame what has happened with my fathers company, Pope said in statement he released in late February.My father wouldve never done something so low, he said of the alleged blackmail and extortion attempt outlined by Bezos in a shocking blog post.He did whatever was needed to uncover a story, but he never blackmailed, slandered or extorted anyone for personal gain.I respect Jeff Bezos for fighting back, Pope said at the time.But a source close to AMI insisted Pope is not in the running.Youd be embarrassed if you went with that, this person said.Another name that has surfaced is Bezos who says the Enquirer promised to hold off on publishing racy photos of him and his mistress, former Fox TV host Lauren Sanchez, if he would declare that its coverage of him was not politically motivated.The Enquirer was the first to report on Bezos steamy affair with Sanchez in January, prior to the alleged extortion attempt.Days before the story emerged, Bezos and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie, announced they were divorcing.But again, a source close to AMI shot down rumors of Bezos as a contender.Thats idiotic, this person said of the Washington Post owner.
Citigroup’s heir apparent says he will retire in surprise move:::::In a surprise move, one of Wall Streets biggest bankers and Citigroup CEOs heir apparent announced hes retiring by the end of the summer.Jamie Forese, Citigroups president and head of investment banking and trading, is leaving the company after 34 years, according to an internal memo obtained by The Post.We would not be the company we are today without his stewardship, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said in the Thursday memo.Forese, 56, had long been seen as the successor to 58-year-old Corbat.Hed risen to head the banks securities unit in 2011, and the investment banking unit two years later.Just six months ago, Citi formally consolidated those two units.After May 1, they will be run by Foreses deputy, Paco Ybarra.We are relatively surprised by Jamie Foreses decision to retire given his relatively young age, Brian Kleinhanzl, bank analyst at KBW, wrote in a note.Its unclear what spurred Foreses departure.He was reportedly frustrated that he didnt have more of a say over the direction of the bank following John Dugans elevation to chairman last year, according to Bloomberg.To many of you, the timing of my decision might come as a surprise, to others perhaps less so, he wrote in a letter to Citigroup staffers.Forese came up as a bond trader at Salomon Brothers until Citigroup bought the trading house in 1998 and was given credit by rivals for helping turn around the bank following its near-death during the financial crisis.
Elizabeth Warren proposes new tax on companies with profits over $100 million:::::WASHINGTON Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is proposing a new tax on corporate profits thats designed to prevent business giants from taking advantage of the existing tax code to effectively pay a zero rate.The 7 percent tax on corporate profits above $100 million is the latest in a series of ambitious policy proposals from the Massachusetts senator.Its in line with her broader push to rein in such industries as the financial sector and technology firms.Her campaign estimates the proposal would hit roughly 1,200 firms.Those corporations would pay the tax on top of any liability under current tax rules, which, as Warren said in a Thursday blog post on her plan, is necessary because our corporate tax code is so littered with loopholes that simply raising the regular corporate tax rate alone is not enough.Dubbing her pitch the Real Corporate Profits Tax, Warren wrote: It will make our biggest and most profitable corporations pay more and ensure that none of them can ever make billions and pay zero taxes again.The proposal would raise about $1 trillion of new revenue over 10 years, according to economists advising Warrens campaign.She didnt specify what that money would pay for.The new tax would be imposed on corporations total profits in the U.S. and overseas.The so-called wealth tax Warren proposed in January on about 75,000 of the nations highest-earning households would raise an estimated $2.75 trillion over 10 years, money that she later said would go partly toward creating a government-supported universal child care program.Warren also is billing the new corporate tax as a way to boost smaller businesses and aid competition with behemoths that may currently pay lower effective tax rates, particularly following the 2017 Republican tax overhaul, which lowered the corporate rate from 35% to 21%.Other Democratic presidential candidates have offered proposals designed to address individual income inequality, such as California Sen. Kamala Harris plan for a lower- and middle-income tax credit, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Bookers plan to endow savings accounts for all children.Warrens latest idea, however, is unique as a foray into new corporate taxation policy.Meanwhile, Warren reported Wednesday that her campaign raised $6 million in the first quarter of the year, surpassing expectations but still lagging far behind the money raised by Harris and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.Warren, a former Harvard University law professor, made a name for herself a decade ago with calls for greater consumer protections, which led to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under President Barack Obama.
Amazon Go stores, designed for digital payments, to accept cash:::::Cash is still king even with Silicon Valley trying to get rid of it.Retailing giant Amazon is caving to political pressure to accept cash at its Amazon Go convenience stores, which are designed around digital payments.We are working to accept cash at Amazon Go, the tech giant said in a statement Wednesday, following a report about a senior Amazon executive privately promising to do away with the practice.On Wednesday, CNBC reported on a recording of a staff meeting in which a senior Amazon executive conceded that the company needs to expand its payment methods in response to criticism that cashless transactions lead to discrimination and elitism.Amazon Go is Amazons grab and go convenience store concept built on sensors that grab payment information, allowing shoppers to swiftly move in and out without having to wait on lines.There are now 10 stores in California, Chicago and Washington, DC, with plans to open as many as 3,000 in the next couple of years.But a number of state and city legislators have opposed the trend arguing that it discriminates against people who may not have bank accounts or credit cards, including low-income people and teenagers.Last month, Philadelphia became the first city to require stores to accept cash, followed by New Jersey.Legislators in New York state, the Big Apple, Chicago and Washington, DC, are weighing similar bills.New York legislators cheered the news.Amazon saw the writing on the wall and made the right decision to start accepting cash at its Amazon Go stores, NYC councilman Ritchie Torres said.A cashless business model is a discriminatory model that excludes the unbanked and people without access to credit.Other retailers could follow Amazons lead.
A tale of two Juul pods: China’s counterfeits pose a threat to US:::::All anyone needs to know about the trade talks between the US and China is contained in the two boxes of Juul pods that I have in front of me.Juul, in case you dont know, is one of those electronic cigarette brands that is made by an American company.The pods are the size of a top of a computer thumb drive.The pods plug into the smoking device the electronic cigarette and deliver the flavor and nicotine to the smoker.Many people consider these e-cigarettes an ingenious way for smokers to get off real tobacco.These are, no matter what you think about smoking and cigarettes, a technological advancement.E-cigarettes are also someones brainchild, which makes them no different from designer handbags, spiffy watches or drugs that lower cholesterol.All these things are someones intellectual property.So why am I saying that the pods on my desk have anything to do with international trade talks?Because one of the boxes is the real thing and the other is a counterfeit version that came from China.The two boxes are identical except for the fact that the fake one has plastic wrapping around it a misstep in the counterfeiting process that Im sure the Chinese will fix just as soon as they read this.Same box right down to the warning on the front and back that This product contains nicotine.Nicotine is an addictive chemical.That makes Juul another victim of Chinas ugly habit of stealing technology, or using the buzzword of the day IP, the abbreviation for intellectual property.The other issue the smaller one, unless you are a smoker is whether the flavored juice inside the counterfeit pods is actually safe to inhale and whether the vapor that the smoker exhales is harmful to those around him.I do plan to send the fake pods out for chemical analysis but didnt have enough time to do it for this column.But eyeballing the pods that came from one fake box shows a clear difference the juice is cloudy.The real pods contain a clear liquid.But the juice in a second box of fakes I have was clear and not much different from the contents of the real pods.So, theres clearly an issue of what you are smoking if you intentionally, or unintentionally, get a box of counterfeit juice pods.Your health could be harmed more than it is by just inhaling nicotine.But the macroeconomic question that the Trump administration has to deal with is whether it can really stop the Chinese from producing knockoff products, whether they be pocketbooks, ties, electronic equipment, drugs or e-cigarettes.Even as the American and Chinese negotiators hash out terms of the trade deal, there are factories in China churning out counterfeit goods.Even when a trade deal with China is finally reached and something will eventually be signed will the Chinese government be willing and able to stop IP theft and counterfeit goods manufacturing?Thats going to be hard for the Chinese to do.Counterfeit goods are a very lucrative business and partly the reason why China ships so many more goods to the US than it buys from us.The tobacco distributor who gave me the fake Juul pods says hes been inundated with photos of a Chinese factory producing these counterfeits.And hes been getting pitches all the time by salesmen for the Chinese company.And while he was too honest to buy the products despite the enormous profit he could be making others may not be as ethical.Juul is already suing 30 Chinese counterfeiters.But that companys effort seems to be against counterfeiters that are selling knockoffs on Amazon and eBay.The bigger test will be whether the company can stop tobacco distributors and stores from handling the fakes.Theres a big profit in the fakes.I paid $35 for a four-pack of real pods the other day.Thatll give a smoker the equivalent of four packs of cigarettes.The real pods cost a distributor about $10 a box.The distributor then sells them to stores for about $20 a box.Each one who handles the pods marks them up for their profit.The counterfeiters were offering fake boxes of pods to distributors for about $4.40 less than half what the real pods would cost.And the smoking device the cigarette that the pod goes into (yes, the counterfeiters have them also) was $5.85, compared with the real one that would cost about there times that amount.The Chinese can copy anything, someone said to me the other day.They sure can.Now its time to see if the Trump administration can break them of that nasty habit.
Caesars Entertainment will be for sale as early as this week:::::Caesars Entertainment, which owns Harrahs and Ballys hotels and casinos, is getting ready to put itself up for sale as soon as this week, The Post has learned.The $24 billion company plans to announce within days that its board has approved a sales process amid pressure from billionaire investor Carl Icahn, sources told The Post.The move comes as Caesars has finally Okd a second potential suitor into its data room to review its financials, sources close to the situation said.Only one other suitor had checked out Caesars books previously.Billionaire Tilman Fertitta, the owner of the Houston Rockets, was recently invited to conduct due diligence using the casino companys records, sources said.This is a change from November when his merger offer was rebuffed due to a concern about the strength of the offer.Caesars had previously given rival Eldorado Resorts, which owns the Tropicana in Atlantic City, access to its financial records, according to reports.Caesars is valued at $5.6 billion on the Nasdaq stock market, but carries a whopping $18 billion in debt giving it a valuation of $23.6 billion.Icahn has been pushing for a sale since he first announced he was an investor in February, with a 10 percent stake.He has quickly become the companys largest shareholder amassing a 28.5 percent stake, including swaps.Icahn, 83, has been advocating for a strategic buyer to take over and help turn around the company, which emerged from bankruptcy in 2017.Both Fertitta and Eldorado fit that bill: Fertitta runs five Golden Nugget casinos, including in Las Vegas and Biloxi, Miss., while Eldorado Resorts owns 26 properties across the country, including Circus Circus and Silver Legacy.On Monday, Icahns control over Caesars is expected to grow even tighter with a fourth board seat, sources said.He presently has three board seats and has been promised an additional seat if the company does not get a permanent CEO by an April 15 deadline.The Caesars board is now focused on cutting corporate expenses, as Icahn has demanded, two sources close to the situation said.Caesars spent $332 million in corporate expenses for the year ended Dec. 31, 2018 and $202 million the prior year.Caesars shares rose 3 percent Wednesday, to close at $9.05.A Caesars spokesman declined to comment.
Hedge fund slammed over $6.8B in unpaid taxes seeks deal with IRS: report:::::In a move that could severely ding investors, secretive hedge fund Renaissance Technologies is in talks to settle a dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over billions in unpaid taxes.RenTechs flagship Medallion fund was determined to have avoided up to $6.8 billion in taxes over a 15-year period by the Senates Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in 2014.Now the hedge fund is warning investors who include the companys billionaire founder and math whiz James Simons that they could incur substantial payments if a deal over the tax dispute is hashed out, according to a December letter seen by Bloomberg, which first reported the news.The funds tax dispute centers on options it controlled tied to a portfolio of securities.The fund held the options long enough to qualify for long-term capital gains, which are far cheaper than short-term capital gains even though the underlying securities the options were based on traded far more frequently, the subcommittee said.RenTech reported the earnings as long-term capital gains and has been fighting the IRS challenge to the strategy, known as basket options.The Medallion fund, open only to current and former RenTech employees, is known for its average annual returns of 40 percent a year net of fees.Simons is one of Medallions investors who can easily afford a bigger tax bill.The East Setauket, NY, resident who founded the hedge fund known for sky-high returns in 1982 is repeatedly named the nations highest earning hedge fund manager and is estimated to be worth $21.5 billion by Forbes.Reps for RenTech declined to comment.
AOC disses Jamie Dimon after Green New Deal criticism:::::Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez fired back at JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Wednesday after he criticized the Green New Deal asking why no top bankers were busted following the 2008 economic collapse when fare beaters she represents can wind up behind bars.I represent kids that go to jail for jumping a turnstile because they cant afford a MetroCard, Ocasio-Cortez told Dimon during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on the industrys preparedness for another crisis.Do you think that more folks should have gone to jail for their role in a financial crisis that led to 7.8 million foreclosures in the 10 years between 2007 and 2016?In a tweet, she also mentioned Dimons role in JPMorgans 2013 settlement with the feds over allegations that the bank fraudulently described the quality of mortgages it sold to hapless investors who later lost their shirts.JP Morgan agreed to pay out *$13 billion* over its massive role in mortgage schemes w the 08 recession, the New York lawmaker wrote.They also finance major fossil fuel pipelines.Its big money.So maybe they *arent* the best authority on prioritizing economic wellbeing of everyday people & the planet, she wrote.Her comments came after Dimon trashed the Green New Deal in an interview Tuesday.I dont spend much time worrying about things that I cant effectuate.Can you focus on climate change in an intelligent way that doesnt damage the economy?Yes, you can.Its called CO2 emission taxes, or trading, theres couple of ways to do it.So you better do it wisely because you could hurt the economy, which hurts everybody, Dimon said during a CNN interview.
JetSmarter app being sold to Vista Global:::::JetSmarter, the once-high-flying private aircraft booking app backed by Jay-Z and the Saudi royal family, agreed to sell itself Wednesday in a stock deal one industry insider called close to worthless.If true, the selling price marks a major comedown for Sergey Petrossov JetSmarters Russian-born and Florida-raised founder whose so-called Uber of the Skies company was valued at $1.6 billion just two years ago.The buyer, Vista Global, didnt mention 30-year-old Petrossov in its announcement of the deal, raising speculation the flight-sharing economys once rising star wasnt included in the sale.Vista also withheld terms of the deal, saying only that JetSmarter investors Clearlake Capital and Jefferies Financial Group would join its shareholder family.The Post reported in February that JetSmarter had begun rescue talks to stay afloat after embracing a business model that at times burnt through $5 million a month.That model once offered JetSmarter members all-you-can-fly private jet privileges for about $50,000 a year a price point permitting some members to break even on their investment before completing a coast-to-coast round trip.JetSmarter overhauled its business model last year, but the changes triggered a flurry of lawsuits accusing the company of bait-and-switch tactics.
Anti-opioid addiction drug maker charged with fraud:::::RICHMOND, Va. Shares in a British company that makes an opioid addiction-withdrawal drug lost about 70% of their value Wednesday after its executives were accused of lying about the product for years to boost profits.Federal prosecutors in Virginia filed fraud charges Tuesday against Indivior, which makes Suboxone film strips that dissolve under the tongues of people addicted to opioids, easing their withdrawal symptoms.The Department of Justice intends to hold accountable those who are in position to know the harm opioid abuse inflicts, but instead choose to profit illegally from the pain of others, Principal Deputy Associate Attorney General Jesse Panuccio said in a statement.The Food and Drug Administration had given Indivior seven years to sell Suboxone tablets without competition from generics, a window that ended in 2009.Prosecutors said Indivior intentionally lied to doctors and others by promoting the strips as a safer alternative, just as pills containing less-expensive generic versions of the key ingredient, buprenorphine, were set to become available.Indiviors revenues from Suboxone film strips jumped from $83 million in 2010 to $843 million in 2014, according to the indictment.Indiviors stock price dropped dramatically in the wake of the indictment, trading at just about $30 a share Wednesday afternoon compared to about $100 a share in the days before.Indivior accused prosecutors of filing unfounded charges in a search for self-serving headlines.The company conducts more research into opioid addiction than any other company, and the products it has brought to market have helped millions of people struggling with opioid addiction, Howard Pien, chairman of the companys board of directors, said in a statement.The legal action comes amid a longstanding gap in access to medications that can help Americans confront the deadliest drug epidemic in US history.Opioids include both legal painkillers such as oxycodone and illicit drugs like heroin and fentanyl.Buprenorphine is one of only three medications approved by the FDA to treat these addictions.The others are methadone and naltrexone.Patients take these drugs to control debilitating withdrawal symptoms such as nausea, anxiety, muscle aches and pain.More than 1,000 lawsuits have been filed against the makers and distributors of prescription painkillers by state and local governments, alleging the companies misled the public about the risks of opioids and encouraged overprescribing.But companies such as Indivior that make treatments for opioid addiction had previously attracted little scrutiny from prosecutors.The indictment filed Tuesday said Indivior officials promoted the film strips as less likely to be abused by opioid addicts than tablets, and offering better protection against accidental use by children, even though the company knew those claims werent true.We need to develop a story about childhood exposures to set the stage for switching patients from tablets to film strips, an unnamed company official wrote in an internal 2009 message, according to the indictment.In fact, prosecutors said Indivior knew the film strips had several traits that could make them more dangerous to children than tablets, including the fact that dissolve quicker and were formulated to taste better.Pien said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has data showing that accidental use by children dropped significantly after Suboxone film was introduced.We are frankly surprised the Justice Department would indict a company for making claims the governments own researchers believe are true, Pien said.The indictment also said the company lied when it announced in 2012 it was halting production of the tablet form of Suboxone because of concerns regarding pediatric exposure.The primary motivation was to delay the FDAs approval of generic forms of the tablet version, prosecutors said.Prosecutors also said that Indivior officials knew the film strips were easier to conceal and more susceptible to smuggling than tablets.Prison officials around the country have struggled to keep Suboxone strips from being given improperly to prisoners.A Virginia woman was arrested last year after prison guards said she hid 230 Suboxone strips in her vagina.A North Carolina man who posed as a pastor was arrested after trying to smuggle Suboxone strips into a jail by hiding them in a Bible, authorities said.Prosecutors also alleged that Indivior steered opioid-addicted patients who sought medical assistance through an internet and phone program to doctors who company executives knew were prescribing Suboxone strips in a careless and clinically unwarranted manner.
There’s ‘never been a better time’ to be a whistleblower in America:::::On Aug. 22, 2001, Enron vice president Sherron Watkins presented CEO Ken Lay with documents and a summary of facts regarding the Houston-anchored energy companys accounting problems.The scandal would eventually bring down Enron.Watkins thought Lay would consult with accounting and legal experts and realize Enron had manipulated its financial statements and likely committed fraud.She also expected her boss would form a crisis management team, figure out the salvageable business lines and brace for a financial tsunami.Of course, Lay took no such actions.Enron soon imploded, declaring bankruptcy on Dec. 2, 2001, and cemented itself in the annals of corporate America as a classic case of greed and hubris.Watkins would later learn that Enrons outside law firm, Vinson and Elkins, had advised the companys lawyers on the potential consequences of discharging employees who raised accounting concerns.Their letter was dated just two days after Watkins meeting with Lay.I was naive as to why the messenger gets shot, Watkins, 59, told MarketWatch in an email.No one wants to hear bad news and they tend to ignore and [shoot] the messenger.Watkins, who lives in Georgetown, Texas, now speaks publicly about leadership and ethics.Blowing the whistle today Whistleblowers have dominated headlines in recent weeks.A memo released in early April revealed that Tricia Newbold, a career official in the White Houses personnel security office, told a congressional committee that dozens of security-clearance application rejections administered by her office were later overturned despite disqualifying issues.(The White House did not immediately return a request for comment, but some Republicans have suggested that Democrats used cherry-picked excerpts from Newbolds testimony to manufacture a misleading narrative.)Meanwhile, Theranos whistleblowers Erika Cheung and Tyler Shultz have attracted renewed attention with the debut of a new ABC News podcast and HBO documentary about the so-called Silicon Valley unicorn.They alerted health regulators to their concerns about the now-defunct blood-testing startup and spoke with The Wall Street Journal investigative reporter John Carreyrou.Last month, the pair launched an Ethics in Entrepreneurship nonprofit.Some also frame the still-evolving #MeToo movement, through which many employees have spoken out about workplace abuses of power, as a form of mass whistleblowing.John Kostyack, the executive director of the National Whistleblower Center advocacy nonprofit, says he believes theres never been a better time to be a whistleblower in this country.We like to destroy the myth that in order to help fight corruption or wrongdoing, you have to sacrifice your livelihood and put yourself and your family at risk, he said.You can do this confidentially [and] anonymously and you can benefit financially.American politics and business are strewn with famous and sometimes infamous whistleblowers among them Watergate informant Deep Throat (later revealed to be FBI official W. Mark Felt), former Pentagon staffer Linda Tripp and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden who have shone a light on legal and ethical misdeeds, often at great professional and personal risk.Some live with complicated legacies: Snowden, alternately deemed a hero and a traitor for his role in uncovering the United States domestic surveillance practices, lives in exile in Moscow.Tripp, whose secretly taped phone calls with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky eventually led to Bill Clintons impeachment, now says she endured a real high-tech lynching for the role she played but only regrets not having the guts to do it sooner.A professional and personal toll Blowing the whistle can be a thankless job.More than one-third of respondents who reported wrongdoing and were identified as the source were either threatened with or received a reprisal as a result, according to a 2010 survey by the US Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent quasi-judicial agency that hears federal employees appeals of removals, demotions and suspensions.Whistleblowing can take a substantial emotional toll, too.One 2018 analysis in the Netherlands found that whistleblowers were significantly more at risk for severe mental-health problems, poor global health and worsening health than other population-based groups.Many also indicated that whistleblowing had a severe and negative effect on work; income; and relationships with ex-colleagues, partners and children, according to the research, which was published in the peer-reviewed journal Psychological Reports.Those risks are higher when youre in a place with a bad culture that does not support whistleblowing, Jennifer Pacella, an assistant professor of law at Baruch College, told MarketWatch.Im confident that with future generations, that will start to shift.The whistleblower who inspired The Informant says he wouldnt do it again Mark Whitacre, a high-ranked executive turned FBI informant in the mid-1990s lysine price-fixing scandal at food-processing company Archer Daniels Midland says many whistleblowers struggle to find work after coming forward.Three former executives were eventually sentenced for their roles in a global scheme to fix prices, including Whitacre.Whitacre lost his immunity from prosecution as a witness when it was discovered that he was taking millions of dollars from the company while working as an informant.He eventually pleaded guilty to fraud.Most of them say they would have left the company and not [gotten] involved, Whitacre, 61, told MarketWatch.I rarely hear one that says theyre glad they did what they did.Whitacre, whom Matt Damon portrayed in the 2009 Steven Soderbergh film The Informant, says he had grown consumed with greed, power and corporate ladder-climbing at ADM.He credits his wife of nearly 40 years, Ginger Whitacre, with demanding he turn himself in to the FBI.So Whitacre wore a wire at work for almost three years and in 1995, the FBI raided ADM.The company later fired Whitacre and alleged he had embezzled millions from ADM; his subsequent conviction landed him in federal prison for nine years.Ginger and their children relocated to each of Whitacres prison locations during his incarceration, he said, visiting every weekend and holiday.The couple calls their saga a messy story with a good ending, he said, adding they wouldnt do it again.Knowing what we know today, we would have left, said Whitacre, a Cornell University Ph.D who now works as the chief operating officer of a biotech company.I just dont think it was our responsibility to have to do that.Nearly three decades later, Whitacre admits theres a little more respect for whistleblowers in society today.I still dont think its easy for them but I think it would be easier, for what we did 25 years ago, to do it today, he said.Theres a little bit more protection for them.Whistleblowers have more protections than ever Here are some of the most salient whistleblower and anti-retaliation protections available now: Despite these protections, there is a fairly complex set of laws and procedures that can land you in trouble if you fail to navigate them properly, Kostyack said.Theres a way to address corruption and to not put yourself at personal risk like there was at one point, he added.But it requires following procedures and staying within time lines and having an intermediary who can represent you and communicate with law enforcement.How to blow the whistle without putting yourself at risk Here are tips from legal experts and whistleblowers on how to say something when you see something while minimizing your own risk: First, talk to a lawyer A lawyer who specializes in whistleblower law should be able to answer questions about possible bounties and anti-retaliation protections and give a second opinion on whether an issue is whistleblower worthy, said attorney Reuben Guttman of the firm Guttman, Buschner & Brooks, which has represented whistleblowers in False Claims Act cases.Look for an attorney who has tried cases, Guttman added and review their writings and case histories.I dont think this is something you want to try to do on your own, Kostyack said.Preserving your confidentiality and having a lawyer help you understand the risks and rewards associated with collecting information is a wise move, he said.Plus, in many corruption cases, multiple statutes are violated.A qualified attorney will be able to advise a whistleblower which laws apply to her or his situation.Weigh the consequences on both sides What will happen if you dont blow the whistle?How critical is it?Are peoples lives in danger if you dont blow the whistle?Whitacre said.On the other hand, he added, consider what your next steps might be if you forge ahead.My wife and I went up against one of the biggest companies in the world and it was a tough go, he said.Fully inform yourself of the potential risks involved, including retaliation, added employment attorney Paula Brantner, a senior adviser to the nonprofit Workplace Fairness.The laws are complicated, the protections arent always straightforward and there can be consequences, she told MarketWatch.The legal system offers what protection it offers, but its rarely tilted in favor of the little guy and gal so it can be very scary, it can be very intimidating and relief may be a long time in coming.Establish a support network Obviously, youll want the support of your family and your close friends, Brantner said.Its a very isolating experience.Figure out whether it makes sense to blow the whistle internally Internal whistleblowing is actually very beneficial to the organization because it allows an organization to address a problem in a very early stage, Pacella said.On the other hand, if eliminating the wrongdoing is going to eliminate a material part of the companys profits, then its pretty clear that solving the problem internally is not going to work, Guttman added.Pacella and Guttman advise considering your workplace culture is it retaliatory, or does management encourage feedback?as well as the track record of your companys ethics department.(A number of companies also provide confidential, anonymous whistleblower hotlines.)Document everything Take notes and suss out potential witnesses, Brantner said.Gather as much documentation as you can by legitimate means, she added.That means no stealing documents, snooping in someone elses files or compiling information by deceptive means.Dont engage in wrongdoing yourself, she said.And after youve blown the whistle, document any events you think may constitute retaliation, Pacella said.Keep good records for yourself, so youre building a body of evidence in the event that you seek to get redress for having experienced retaliation, she said.Be mindful of time Various so-called statutes of limitations place limits on how much time can pass between the last illegal act and when the whistleblower files her or his claim, Kostyack said.Be smart about how you communicate Dont use company-issued computers, phones, electronic devices or WiFi signals to reach out to attorneys or journalists, Kostyack said.Whistleblowers should know that when a company is committing fraud, every internal communication is likely being tracked by their superiors, he said.This includes emails, phone conversations and website visits using company technology, as we recently found in the Theranos case.Instead, he recommends in-person meetings or using encrypted email or secure websites accessed off company property and with non-company-issued technology.Be careful not to use exact phrases or figures that could be traced back to you with a quick search of your emails by management.That was how management at Theranos first earmarked Tyler Shultz as a whistleblower and, subsequently, threatened him with legal action, a process that cost him six figures in legal defense fees.If you played a role in the misconduct Be aware that your own conduct will be scrutinized, Brantner said.Consult with a lawyer about your potential risks in coming forward based on your own actions.Join forces Talk amongst your peers, find others who agree with your assessment and report together, Watkins said.There is strength in numbers.Ken Lay could dismiss my concerns as the opinion of one person.
Ex-Goldman CEO tweets Post story as Wall Street execs grilled:::::This former Wall Street titan is a Tab-Lloyd reader.Lloyd Blankfein, the ex-CEO of Goldman Sachs, retweeted The Posts Wednesday story about bigwig bankers getting grilled on Capitol Hill and sounded like he was happy that he wasnt one of them.Boy, I really miss my old job!!!Blankfein tweeted.The tweet linked to The Posts story about how Wall Street bosses including David Solomon, Blankfeins successor at Goldman were getting grilled by lawmakers over systemic risks that too big to fail banks could pose to the US economy.Blankfein, who stepped down in September after more than a decade at the helm of Goldman, posts on the social media site rarely with fewer than 10 tweets during the past year.Hes also a noted Post fan.Last year, Blankfein told The Post hed had a coffee mug made with Post headlines about him that read Tab-Lloyd across it.
Lawmakers grill Wall Street bigwigs over risks to US economy:::::The titans of Wall Street got hauled onto Capitol Hill on Wednesday to get grilled about whether their too big to fail banks could crash the economy.The chief executives of seven top US financial giants including JPMorgan Chases Jamie Dimon and Goldman Sachs David Solomon faced questions from lawmakers about systemic risks to the US banking system the first such hearing in nearly a decade.Im concerned that several of these [banks] are simply too big to manage, said US Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Financial Services Committee.For nearly seven hours, committee members pelted the CEOs with questions about everything from Russian money laundering to overdraft charges.Nevertheless, they failed to dig into some of the industry s biggest scandals of late.Not a single lawmaker, for example, bothered to ask Solomon about the banks involvement with a $6 billion Malaysian bribery scheme despite Solomons reported approval of the deals and forecasts of hefty settlements weighing on the banks stock price.Early reports had said that the bankers would let Dimon field most of the questions but Rep.Waters tried to put a stop to that before the questioning began.We know that hes very smart, we know hes been around for a long time, Waters said of Dimon.But its not just his show today.In his opening statement, Dimon said that the risks that led to the global financial crisis in 2008, like the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, arent a big concern today, although he did point to large, unregulated non-bank mortgage lenders as a risk.Lehman simply would not happen again, he said.Near the end of the hearing, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) grilled Dimon on whether more bank executives should have gone to prison for their role in the 2008 financial crisis.I think if people broke the law they should go to jail, Dimon said.The executives agreed that cybersecurity was the biggest threat to the financial system, and they were meeting with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and members of the Department of Homeland Security following the hearing.Other banks represented were Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, State Street, Bank of America, and Bank of New York.The hearing was in stark contrast to the last time a group of Wall Street CEOs had been lambasted by Congress in 2009, after receiving some $176 billion in bailout money.
Ex-TPG big charged in college admissions scam faces new scandal:::::Bill McGlashan, the private equity bigwig embroiled in the college admissions bribery scandal, has a new problem on his hands and it involves money, cosmetics and North Korea.McGlashan who has pleaded not guilty to federal charges that he agreed to pay $250,000 for a fake football profile to get his son into USC is now facing a probe from investors in publicly traded Elf Beauty, which markets cruelty-free makeup at discount stores like Walmart and Target, sources said.Until he got arrested last month, McGlashan had been on Elfs board and ran the TPG Growth fund, which controls Elf.That has hedge fund Marathon Partners probing if McGlashan had a role in the companys failure to promptly disclose violations of North Korea sanctions that landed the affordable makeup seller in hot water with regulators, according to a source with direct knowledge of the probe.Elf made headlines in January 2019 when it revealed it told regulators in early 2017 that some eyelash kits it was selling included material that came from North Korea, in violation of US sanctions.Elf agreed to pay $1 million to settle the matter.Shareholders, including Marathon, say they should have known about the sanctions violation ahead of a March 2017 secondary stock offering, the source said.The charges for the violation could have been as high as $40 million for the company, whose market cap on Tuesday stood at $576 million.McGlashans TPG Growth sold 5 million Elf shares worth $135 million in the 2017 secondary offering.Elf did not sell any stock.The companys share price has fallen sharply, from $27 in its March 2017 secondary offering to closing Tuesday at $11.85.The dustup comes as TPG is investigating McGlashan to see if his alleged attempt to bribe college admissions officers bled into other parts of the firms business.As reported by The Post, TPG is deciding how much, if any, compensation they should give McGlashan, who stands to lose hundreds of millions from successful TPG investments, including Uber.Marathon, which has an 8.5% Elf stake, has blasted the cosmetics companys board before.In September 2018, the Manhattan-based hedge fund accused McGlashan, then the chair of Elfs compensation committee, of having approved big pay packages for top executives with whom he had prior relationships as the head of TPG Growth.Marathon has also demanded Elf separate its CEO and chairman roles and said that TPG, with its 28% Elf stake, should reduce its board to two from three.The company welcomes constructive dialogue with all of our stockholders, and we have engaged with Marathon consistently over the past year, a spokesperson said.While we have found common ground on some points, we simply do not agree with many of Marathons characterizations and positions.Marathon declined to comment.McGlashan didnt immediately return requests for comment.
Uber plans to sell around $10B worth of stock in IPO:::::Uber Technologies Inc has decided it will seek to sell around $10 billion worth of stock in its initial public offering, and will make public the registration of the offering on Thursday, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.An IPO of this size would make Uber one of the biggest technology IPOs of all time, and the largest since that of Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014.Uber is seeking a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion, influenced by the poor performance of smaller rival Lyft Incs shares following its IPO late last month, the sources said.Investment bankers previously told Uber it could be worth as much as $120 billion.Uber most recently was valued at $76 billion in the private fundraising market.Most of the shares sold would be issued by the company, while a smaller portion would be owned by Uber investors cashing out, one of the sources said.Uber plans to make its IPO registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission publicly available on Thursday, and will kick of its investor roadshow during the week of April 29, putting it on track to price its IPO and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May, the sources said.The sources cautioned that the plans are still subject to change and market conditions, and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.A representative for Uber declined to comment.Lyfts IPO priced at the top end of its upwardly revised range last month, assigning it a valuation of more than $24 billion in an offering that raised $2.34 billion.But the stock has traded poorly since debuting on the Nasdaq on March 29, as concerns about the startups path to profitability have become more prominent.The shares ended trading on Tuesday at $67.44, well below their $72 IPO price.In moderating its valuation expectations, Uber is showing a realism that is being increasingly adopted by Silicon Valley unicorns, as stock market investors push back against some of the lofty price tags sought.On Monday, Pinterest Inc set a price range for its IPO that values it below the $12 billion at which the online image-search company sourced its last private fundraising in 2017.Uber operates in more than 70 countries.In addition to ride-hailing, its business includes bike and scooter rentals, freight hauling, food delivery, and an expensive self-driving car division.During the IPO roadshow, Ubers chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the companys culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas.Uber last year had revenue of $11.3 billion, while gross bookings from rides was $50 billion.But the company lost $3.3 billion, excluding gains from the sale of its overseas business units in Russia and Southeast Asia.
Bristol-Myers shareholders approve drugmaker's $74 billion deal with Celgene:::::Bristol-Myers Squibb shareholders approved the pharmaceutical giant's $74 billion acquisition of cancer drugmaker Celgene in a vote on Friday.The deal, announced in January, was hard sell to Bristol shareholders from the start and the approval concludes a tumultuous period for Bristol, which saw push back from institutional investors.The acquisition adds about $32 billion in fresh debt to Bristol's balance sheet while assuming $20 billion in Celgene's debt, the companies said at the time.More than 70% of eligible shareholders voted for the deal, the company said Friday.Roughly 24% of shareholders voted against the deal and 1% abstained.Both Bristol and Celgene shares were slightly higher in morning trading."We are pleased with the outcome of today's Special Meeting and thank our shareholders for their support for this combination," Bristol's Chairman and CEO Giovanni Caforio said in a statement.Buying Celgene was seen by Wall Street analyst as giving Bristol more cancer drugs at a time when its immuno-oncology portfolio struggles to keep up with rival Merck's.Bristol's blockbuster Opdivo, which boosts the immune system to attack cancer, has fallen behind its leading competitor, Merck's Keytruda.Hedge funds Wellington Management and Starboard Value in late February said the deal didn't sit well with them.Wellington which is Bristol's largest institutional holder said the deal asked Bristol shareholders to accept too much risk.Starboard cited similar concerns, saying the Celgene deal was "poorly conceived and ill-advised."Starboard eventually ended its fight against the buyout once Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis recommended Bristol-Myers shareholders vote in favor of its bid.For more on investing in health-care innovation, click here to join CNBC at our Healthy Returns Summit in New York City on May 21.Bristol said Friday the deal, which is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, will create a "premier innovative biopharma company with leading scientific capabilities.""We look forward to bringing the companies together, which we believe will deliver significant shareholder value," Caforio said.
Health-are stocks plunge as lawmakers threaten action on drug prices:::::Health-care stocks were poised to end the week in the red on Friday after lawmakers on Capitol Hill threatened to write new laws tightening control over the nation's largest pharmacy benefit mangers to curb skyrocketing drug costs.The Trump administration's legal challenge to former President Barack Obama's signature health insurance law, the Affordable Care Act, and Sen. Bernie Sanders's new "Medicare for All" bill also weighed on the industry's shares.The XLV, an ETF that tracks the health-care industry's biggest companies, was down 1.48% for the week as of Friday morning.The biggest drops were from insurers Anthem, Humana and UnitedHealth Group, which were all down more than 5% for the week through Thursday's close.Executives from CVS Health, Cigna, Prime Therapeutics, Humana and UnitedHealth's OptumRx testified about rising prescription drug costs before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday.The PBMs left the congressional hearing mostly unscathed but Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, hinted the committee is ready to write new laws to bring down drug prices.Ana Gupte, Leerink Partners senior health-care services analyst, said the health-care sell off is mostly driven by the proposed legislative changes to the PBMs' business model, which are paid so-called rebates by Big Pharma for getting their drugs covered by private and public insurance plans, like Medicare.These so-called "backdoor deals" are suspected by lawmakers to increase drug costs for patients.It is "very likely" lawmakers force drug companies to give those rebates to consumers instead, starting as early as next year, Gupte said.Separately, a federal appeals court in New Orleans said Wednesday it will hear arguments in July on a lawsuit backed by President Donald Trump to overturn Obamacare.Dismantling the health-care law would lead to 32 million more uninsured people in the U.S. by 2026, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.Separately, Sen. Sanders unveiled a universal health-care plan on Wednesday, which would eliminate most private health insurance by creating a government-run system to provide health insurance for all Americans.For more on investing in health-care innovation, click here to join CNBC at our Healthy Returns Summit in New York City on May 21."Newsflow on the Medicare for All proposal from Senator Bernie Sanders and the scheduling of the hearing on the Texas Court decision to overthrow the ACA at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in July also contributed to the sell off in health-care stocks," Gupte said.Ross Muken, an analyst at Evercore ISI, told clients in a note that watching the industry's shares fall has "not been fun," but added he expects first-quarter earnings to be positive as "fundamentals generally remain positive and utilization still appears under control."
Disney's Iger hints at more job cuts from Fox deal: 'There's work to do':::::Disney's chief executive said that the company has only just started making global layoffs as it works to incorporate its newly acquired assets from 21st Century Fox.Bob Iger, the chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company, added that the job cuts are necessary to generate beneficial synergies, an industry term referring to the impact a business tip-up can have on profits or revenues.In this case, Disney's executives have forecast about $2 billion in cost saving synergies as the combined company cuts business segments or employees that were duplicated through the Fox acquisition."We're just beginning a consolidation process across the world.And we've been candid about that with people in the organization," Iger told CNBC's David Faber on Thursday."There's work to do to get to the synergies that we talked about, which were cost synergies.We have consolidation ahead of us."Asked explicitly whether there are more job cuts to come, Iger answered in the affirmative."We're very early into this process and I've never second guessed decisions that we've made.And I'm certainly not going to second guess this one, not at this point anyway," he added.Iger told that his conversations with Fox's Rupert Murdoch that ultimately led to the $71 billion deal were based on on the launch of Disney+.The chief executive's sit-down with CNBC came just after Iger and other Disney leaders unveiled Disney+, the company's forthcoming direct-to-consumer offering.The streaming service is set for launch on Nov. 12 and will cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year.Iger also confirmed at the company's investor day on Thursday that he will step down in 2021."I'm expecting my contract to expire at the end of 2021," Iger said during Disney's investor day presentations."And I was going to say 'and this time I mean it,' but I've said it before."Iger has postponed his contract with Disney twice during his tenure and has made a successful Disney+ a priority in his last few years at the head of the company."The most important thing is that the company get through the transition seamlessly," Iger told CNBC."I believe that two-and-a-half years from now, or roughly two years after we've launched this massive initiative, the company it will be well on its way.""That will be the right time for a transition at the CEO level.The Fox acquisition will have been assimilated.We will be off and running on the direct-to-consumer space," he added.
Lyft is having a brutal week with the stock down 20% since Monday:::::Shares of Lyft are down more than 20% for the week as investors finally got their first look inside its rival's business, Uber.The stock is on track to close in the negative four out of five days this week and drop $3 billion in market capitalization.The stock started the week priced at $74.45 from last Friday's close, above its IPO price of $72.As of Friday morning, shares traded around $59 with a market capitalization of about $17 billion.Lyft continued to plunge about 3% on Friday after Uber released its S-1 where it reported 2018 revenue of $11.27 billion compared to Lyft's $2.2 billion.Uber said it posted a net profit of $997 million in 2018, thought it has a loss of $1.85 billion on an adjusted EBITDA basis.Lyft reported a loss of $911 million in its public filing.Still, investors are still uncertain of how to compare the two stocks.Besides the different components of their businesses, with Uber investing in its freight and meal delivery services on top of ridesharing, their financials are difficult to stack up.Wedbush Securities analysts gave Lyft a neutral rating on Friday with a 12-month price target of $80, saying concern they've heard from investors prior to Uber's S-1 are not eased much now that it's public."And now that Uber's S-1 was released after the close yesterday we think investors don't yet have a whole lot more clarity on some of the key comparable metrics," the analysts wrote."Uber does not break out its metrics between the US and international beyond noting that 52% of bookings and 74% of rides come from outside the US.Additionally, Uber defines its rider metrics by combining both rideshare and Uber Eats riders, so generating metrics like billings per ride, revenue per ride and profit per ride are not fully comparable."The analysts tried to approximate how the two compare, saying Uber's "ridesharing take rate," defined as revenue over gross bookings, was 22% in 2018 compared to Lyft's 26%.But they noted that Uber includes tolls and surcharges in gross bookings, unlike Lyft and Uber's numbers were global, which suggests a larger spread of its range."We believe there could be continued pressure on Lyft shares while investors wait for Uber's roadshow and dig further into the full financial metrics," Wedbush analysts wrote."In our opinion, the battle for market share will be balanced going forward.We think there's plenty of work to do and time to go until investors start to feel like they are missing out on the 'next Amazon' although we believe Lyft remains in a strong position to capitalize on this fertile market opportunity."Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.Watch: Here's everything you need to know about the 300 page Uber IPO filing
Disney+ just put a lot of pressure on Apple's streaming video service:::::Disney shocked the tech and media worlds on Thursday when it announced that its streaming video subscription would cost $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year significantly less than Netflix or Amazon Prime currently cost.There were gasps at Disney's launch event when it revealed the price.But the company that might need to make the most changes in response to the Disney+ product is Apple.Apple said last month that it will release its streaming video service, Apple TV+, this fall.The subscription service will include exclusive original shows, movies and documentaries produced by Apple.The company is spending billions of dollars on stars like Oprah Winfrey, Steve Carell, Jennifer Aniston and Steven Spielberg.But no matter how well Apple's shows and movies end up being received, there's no way that it can compete with the lineup of content that Disney has assembled for Disney+, which will put pressure on Apple to undercut Disney's price or give its shows away for free, as was once the company's strategy, CNBC first reported in October of last year."While there is uncertainty in the broader media landscape ... we believe Disney is in the best position to succeed given its unmatched arsenal of content, well recognized global brand and impressive marketing arm," JP Morgan analyst Alexia Quadrani wrote in a note distributed on Friday.Disney's service will have significantly more robust content than previously expected, the JPM analysts wrote, including the entire Pixar library, a selection of Marvel shows, "Star Wars" movies and "The Simpsons."That's in addition to original content Disney is creating as well."It's called back catalog," RBC technology analyst Mark Mahaney told CNBC.Compare that to Apple's 35 or so original shows and movies: A handful of series, none of which are major existing franchises, that Apple is bankrolling from scratch.A TV comedy called "The Morning Show" and an anthology produced by Steven Spielberg called "Amazing Stories" are Apple's flagship scripted shows.Apple isn't expected to buy licenses for third-party content like Netflix does.There are some huge names attached to Apple productions, but even if Apple's shows wildly exceed expectations, it's still going to take years to build up fanbases like Disney's properties.Apple hasn't revealed a price or release date for Apple TV+, which will enable it to pivot in response to Disney if it wants.Apple hasn't even confirmed if it will charge for Apple TV+, although the company's marketing language strongly suggests it will.Apple's two current content subscriptions, for news and music, both cost $10 per month.Consumers are already complaining that they pay for too many content subscriptions.People could end up passing on Apple for Disney's superior content, especially if it ends up being less expensive than Apple.Apple could end up returning to its original content plan: Giving away shows for free as part of its digital TV strategy, and creating a platform to charge viewers for subscriptions to legacy media companies, including Disney.Disney and Apple have historically been eager to partner with each other.Disney CEO Bob Iger is on Apple's board of directors, and he said on Thursday that Disney+ will most likely be available on Apple devices, including its TV box.(He also said he recuses himself from all discussions about streaming services at Apple.)In that scenario, Apple would be able to focus on one of its core strengths: Building a platform for other companies to reach the masses of Apple users, best summed up by Oprah Winfrey at Apple's TV launch: "They're in a billion pockets, y'all."
Iger says Disney bought Fox because of value it adds to streaming service: 'The light bulb went off':::::Disney wouldn't have spent $71 billion on 21st Century Fox assets including National Geographic, "The Simpsons" and its movie studio if it didn't have plans to launch its own streaming service, according to the company's top executive.Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger told CNBC on Thursday that his conversations with Fox's Rupert Murdoch were predicated on the introduction of Disney+ and followed its 2017 purchase of BAMTech, a New York-based streaming media company."The opportunity to buy Fox first came up later that year.In fact, just a few months after the board approved us buying the majority share of BAMTech which was done for one reason, to go into the direct-to-consumer business Rupert and I sat down and talked about a transaction," Iger told CNBC's David Faber."We would not have done that transaction had we not decided to go in this direction," Iger continued, "because if we hadn't, we would have been looking at that business and through a traditional lens: 'Oh, we're buying TV channels.We're buying more movie-making capability, et cetera.'""But by the time the acquisition opportunity came up, and we knew we were going in this space, we evaluated what we were buying through this new lens of: 'Wow, what could National Geographic mean to us?'"Iger's comments came shortly after the company told stakeholders that its new streaming service, Disney+, will launch on Nov. 12 and be available for purchase for $69.99 per year.The platform will host Disney's extensive vault of feature films ranging from the "Star Wars" franchise to action films from Marvel Studios.It will also include the myriad Fox assets acquired during the deal that closed in late March."What could it mean having access to [Fox's] library, not to monetize it through traditional means, but to do it through this?"Iger added."Bam!I mean, the light bulb went off."
Netflix is falling on concerns of competition from Disney+:::::Netflix tumbled more than 3% on Friday after Disney unveiled its Disney+ streaming service and pricing for the first time.The drop shed about $5 billion from Netflix's market value, though it is up about 15% over the past 12 months.While some analysts seem less concerned that competition from Disney+ will be a significant hit to Netflix's business, investors may still be uneasy with the entrance of a cheaper service with a huge library of time-tested content.Disney+ subscriptions will give consumers access to exclusive content for $6.99 per month or $69.99 for a full year, compared with Netflix's standard plan offering of $13 per month, recently raised from $11.Shares of Disney soared 9% Friday.Disney+ and Netflix could certainly coexist in consumers' library of streaming services.Disney CEO Bob Iger made clear that the new service is aimed at kids, saying that other offerings like sports and adult content are available on their other services like ESPN+ and Hulu."Bottom-line, Disney+ features family content, while NFLX offers a much broader range of content with the majority of the most-searched content on the platform."analysts from SunTrust wrote in a note Friday."As such, we do not view Disney+ as a strong alternative to NFLX."The analysts added that in a recent survey conducted by the firm, only 8% of existing Netflix subscribers who responded expect to churn to Disney+, while 59% expected to continue to subscribe only to Netflix.Twenty-four percent of respondents expected to subscribe to both services, according to the survey.Disney+ could actually be a positive for Netflix, the analysts wrote, since the entrance of a new streaming player could further "accelerate cord-cutting."Still, other analysts see a significant threat in Disney's offering.Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets told CNBC on Friday that Disney has a "major advantage" over Netflix because it does not need to spend much to build up its already-full content library."There is going to be pressure here on Netflix to continue to differentiate their service with more and more original content spend, that's the major advantage ... that Disney has they've got a back catalog," he said.Still, Mahaney said he still believes consumers will be willing to sign up for both services if they're both robust."We did our survey work here, we think the vast majority of consumers are perfectly willing to sign up for more than one service," Mahaney said.CNBC's Eustance Huang contributed to this report.Disclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.Watch: Disney's Bob Iger: I believe Disney+ is going to be successful
GM teases 2020 Chevy Corvette C8 in bid for Ferrari, McLaren luxury sports car market:::::While the Corvette may not generate the sort of sales you'd expect of a Chevy SUV like the new Blazer, it has long been billed as "America's sports car," giving a halo not just to GM but the American auto industry, as a whole.The latest version, known to fans as the C7 for the Corvette seventh-generation model is an impressive and well-respected piece of machinery, but not quite a world-beater.The C8, it is widely expected, will be the first version to give a serious challenge to the likes of Ferrari, McLaren and Lamborghini.Corvettes, up until now, have put their engines up front, pretty much like anything else that you'd find in your typical showroom.With rare exception, all of those European brands traditionally mount their engines amidship, or even in the rear, layouts that translate into markedly better vehicles dynamics.With its big V-8, the Corvette is plenty quick.It just can't keep up with the likes of a Ferrari sweeping through the corners.It's not that GM hasn't thought about building a true world-beater.Coming up with a mid-engine model was the one unfulfilled dream of Zora Arkus-Duntov, the Belgian-born engineer widely known as "the father of the Corvette."Since the first 'Vette was produced 66 years ago, in fact, there have been any number of prototypes, none making it into production.The Corvette itself nearly went away during the automaker's economic collapse a decade ago.The current model, the C7, was officially put on hold as GM went through bankruptcy, though a secret skunkworks team kept plugging away until the automaker could loosen up the purse strings again.The current model has widely been hailed as the best Corvette ever but ever so slightly short of being that true Ferrari challenger.
Southwest removes Boeing 737 Max from flight schedule through early August as grounding persists:::::Southwest Airlines has removed the Boeing 737 Max jet from its schedule through Aug. 5, a key summer travel period.It's unclear how many Southwest flights will be canceled as a result.Southwest suspended all 34 of its Max jets from its fleet of more than 750 Boeing 737 models after the Max's anti-stall software was implicated in an Ethiopian crash in March that killed 157 people.There's no timetable for the return of the Max, which has been grounded since mid-March.Boeing has slowed production and stopped deliveries as it works on a software fix.Other major airlines like American and United have canceled thousands of flights because of prolonged groundings.American, which operates 24 Max planes and has 76 more on order, canceled roughly 1,200 flights in March.United has 14 of the Boeing 737 Max 9s in its fleet, and like American, has canceled 737 Max flights through June 5."The limited number of customers, who have already booked their travel and will be affected by this amended schedule, are being proactively notified so that we can reaccommodate their flight plans well in advance of their travel date," Southwest President Tom Nealon said in a statement.
Disney chief Bob Iger: The media industry 'has never been this dynamic':::::Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger believes that the media industry is at a turning point as novel technologies and consumer preferences demand even more from those in the entertainment business.In an interview with CNBC's David Faber, the longtime CEO said that while the company will always be tied to quality storytelling, the launch of its new direct-to-consumer service Disney+ reveals just how much the media landscape is evolving."It's changing so much, the marketplace has never been this dynamic, meaning speed of change is much faster," Iger said in the interview that aired Friday on CNBC."And that's technology, that's consumer behavior driven by technology.It's economics, it's how things are marketed anywhere you look."Iger's comments came shortly after he and other Disney top brass unveiled at the company's investor day its streaming service, Disney+.The platform, which will be available starting Nov. 12, will offer customers an enormous amount of Disney media from Day One.Feature films from Pixar, Lucasfilms, Marvel Studios will accompany new, original content on the platform and will be available for download so that films and shows can be viewed offline.Iger also told analysts on Thursday he plans to step down when his contract ends in 2021.The hotly anticipated Disney+ likely marks a key moment in the industry's pivot toward a streaming-dominant platform as more and more customers flock to direct options like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video.Iger added that while Disney may not have been the first player in the streaming space, it is important that the company continue to modernize to not fall behind both in storytelling and in how that storytelling is delivered."I think one of the reasons why companies fail to innovate is, they continue to measure it against today," Iger said."It becomes very, very difficult to innovate again, because you just you're you're so tied to the business model that got you where you are, which could be great.""But it often causes companies to not think about: what is that business model going to look like tomorrow?"he added.Disclosure: Comcast, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, is a co-owner of Hulu.
Disney shares surge after unveiling streaming service that's cheaper than Netflix:::::Disney shares jumped on Friday after the company announced its Disney+ video streaming service would be $6.99 a month, two dollars a month cheaper than Netflix's basic subscription."I'm pretty optimistic about the ability for this thing to work.Particularly when you make it accessible because of the content we're putting on, because of the user interface and because of the price," CEO Bob Iger told CNBC's David Faber in an interview Thursday.Shares of Disney surged 9% in morning trading on Friday, on pace for its best day since May 2009.Netflix shares traded lower by more than 3% on Friday.Disney+ will roll out in the U.S. on November 12, and within the next two years, the platform will be available "in nearly all major regions of the world."The pricing on the ad-free service is surprisingly low $6.99 per month and $69.99 annually (or $5.83 per month).That's lower than Netflix, which raised prices on its standard plan from $10.99 to $12.99 per month.Netflix's basic plan is $8.99 a month."Disney surprised on the upside at its investor meeting yesterday, providing more financial disclosure and revealing a more content rich streaming service than previously expected," J.P. Morgan analyst Alexia Quadrani said in a note to investors."In addition, management provided a target for Disney+ of 60m-90m subscribers by F2024, on the higher end of our expectations, which we believe were already above consensus."Disney+ will also have multiple movies and TV series that are exclusive to the service.Those include several series from Marvel and Star Wars.Disney said it expects it will spend about $1 billion in 2020 on original content for the platform and $2 billion by 2024.Disney's stock closed at $116.60 a share on Thursday.CNBC's Yun Li and Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.
PNC Financial's first-quarter profit meets estimates:::::PNC Financial's first-quarter profit met analysts' estimates on Friday, as a rise in expenses and provision for credit losses overshadowed growth in interest income and loans.The lender's expenses rose 2% to $2.58 billion, while provision for loan losses more than doubled to $189 million from a year ago.Net interest income rose about 5% to $2.48 billion, helped by higher interest rates.PNC Financial, one of the largest U.S. lenders by assets, said its loan portfolio grew about 5% to about $232 billion, with commercial lending accounting for nearly 68 percent of total loans.Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based PNC's net income attributable to shareholders rose 2.7% to $1.20 billion in the first quarter ended March 31.Earnings per share came in at $2.61, in line with analysts' expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.The bank's total revenue rose 4.3 percent to $4.29 billion.
Golf betting stronger than ever ahead of Masters Tournament:::::A field of 87 professional golfers teed off Thursday for the 83rd Annual Masters Tournament, and bettors are also coming out stronger than ever.The Masters is golf's most heavily bet on tournament of the year and with legalized sports betting taking hold in several states across the country, experts say that the state of golf betting is stronger than it's ever been.At MGM Resorts, Masters weekend is a top 10 weekend for drawing in sports bettors.The 24 hours before the tournament starts is when most of the wagers come.Between 90% to 93% of bets placed are on who will win the tournament, with about 5% to 10% of bettors wagering on the prop bets and match-ups, according to Jay Rood, vice president of race and sports at MGM Resorts.The company's biggest liabilities are Kevin Kisner, Tiger Woods, Tommy Fleetwood and Dustin Johnson.A 43-year-old Woods enters the tournament ranked twelfth in the world as he looks to win his first Masters since 2005.At the start of the tournament, odds for him to win were at 14/1 behind Rory McIlroy (8/1), Johnson (13/1) and tied with Justin Rose, according to sportsbook.ag.Rood said Woods' impact on betting causes activity to increase when he's in the mix, although his impact was significantly stronger four to five years ago.
Chevron to buy Anadarko Petroleum in a $33 billion cash and stock deal:::::Chevron announced on Friday it will acquire oil and gas driller Anadarko Petroleum in a cash and stock deal valued at $33 billion, marking one of the biggest energy sector mergers in years and a transformative moment for one of the industry's dominant players.The transaction will expand the second biggest U.S. energy company's operations in U.S. shale oil and gas production, offshore drilling and liquefied natural gas exports.The deal represents the 11th biggest ever for an energy and power company, according to Refinitiv.The acquisition launches Chevron to a new competitive level, establishing the San Ramon, California-based company as a more formidable challenger to rival oil giants Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP, says energy and mining research firm Wood Mackenzie.After the deal closes, Chevron will go from being the fourth biggest international oil major by production to the second largest."This is the biggest upstream deal since Shell and BG in 2015," said Roy Martin, senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie."Chevron now joins the ranks of the UltraMajors and the big three becomes the big four."
India's Jet Airways cancels all international flights as debt problems deepen:::::The debt-swamped Indian airline Jet Airways has canceled all of its international flights on Friday.According to its own website, flights scheduled to depart today from Delhi to Singapore, London, Amsterdam and Kathmandu have all been axed.Heathrow to Delhi and Mumbai services have also been canceled, according to the London airport's website.The airline has run out of cash, forcing pilots to go without salaries for months and causing failed payments to companies that lease aircraft, as well as defaults on other loans.With aircraft leasing firms going unpaid, the number of planes operating under the Jet Airways name has collapsed.On Thursday local media reported that the airline had grounded ten more planes due to unpaid leasing fees and was now only operating 14 planes for international flights.Illustrating the point, flight tracking website Flightradar24 has published a tweet showing the steady reduction in international services being offered by Jet Airways over the last 12 months.In an emailed statement to CNBC, the public relations team for Jet Airways in the United Kingdom confirmed the cancellations between London and India for Friday.There was no indication if services would soon return to normal.The statement said that the airline was working to minimize inconvenience to passengers and "in line with regulatory guidelines" was "offering re-accommodation choices or extending applicable refunds as the situation warrants."It added that at a corporate level, the airline's management and key stakeholders were continuing to "work closely towards resolving the current situation."Estimates puts the carrier's debt pile at more than $1 billion and in January it was revealed that it had defaulted on loans, including those to the government-owned State Bank of India (SBI).In March, the airline's founder, Naresh Goyal, stepped down as chairman, handing majority control to a consortium of Indian lenders led by the SBI.On Wednesday, the lenders extended a deadline for outside bidders to take a stake of up to 75% in the airline.Initial interest bidders have until the end of today with binding bids wanted in place by the end of April, according to a notice on the SBI Capital Markets website.Middle East airline Etihad, which holds a 12% share in Jet Airways, has reportedly expressed an interest in upping its stake.Rules dictate that foreign entities can own no more than 49% of an Indian airline.India's Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu, took to Twitter to say he would "review issues related to Jet Airways" and take "necessary steps to minimise passenger inconvenience and ensure their safety".Jet Airways had its first flight in May 1993, operating primarily out of Mumbai.Its latest official figures put the number of employees at more than 17,000.Domestically, it is now India's third-largest private airline after IndiGo and Spice Jet, holding a 10% passenger market share during February 2019.
Disney CEO Iger gives three reasons why the company's streaming service will be a success:::::Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger explained to CNBC's David Faber that he believes customers will flock to the company's new streaming service, Disney+, thanks to a unique combination of factors."I'm pretty optimistic about the ability for this thing to work.Particularly when you make it accessible because of the content we're putting on, because of the user interface and because of the price," Iger said."If, in five years' time, I prove to be wrong or we prove to be wrong we're still making great content that's going to be in great demand globally.""And you can shift in a moment and license to third parties," he added."But I don't think that's really an issue.You're building up library value regardless."Disney announced Thursday that its streaming service will be available starting on Nov. 12.The new service will allow customers unlimited downloads so that content can be viewed offline.Iger also told analysts on Thursday that he would be stepping down in 2021 when his contract ends.Disney+ also represents a big bet by the media giant that it can both terminate its profitable licensing relationship with Netflix and eventually compete with the entrenched rival.It acquired assets from 21st Century Fox for $71 billion to shore up its content trove, including National Geographic and the Fox movie studio.The Fox assets joined a host of heavyweight entertainment assets like Marvel Studios and Lucasfilm, producer of the "Star Wars" empire.All of the company's 2019 films will be available on Disney+ when their theatrical and home entertainment windows have end.The company added that it will continue to release major motion pictures to theaters prior to their appearance on the streaming service.Disney+ is expected to mark a critical moment in the fierce streaming wars between the likes of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video.
Bob Iger says Disney's brand gives new streaming service an edge over Netflix:::::Disney Chairman and CEO Bob Iger told CNBC's David Faber on Thursday that the company's new streaming platform has an edge over rival streaming service Netflix."While I think Netflix has done a good job of creating brand value, and name value, and a product that I think is considered of great value to a lot of people, they're still building their brand in many respects," Iger said."Whereas in our case, we start with a customer relationship that, in many respects is visceral.""We're pricing this to be accessible to the millions and millions if not hundreds of millions of Disney fans, and Marvel fans, and Pixar fans, and 'Star Wars' fans that are out there," he added."The sheer number of people worldwide that know our brands, that interact with our brands on a daily basis, that spend money on our brands is huge.And no other company has that."Disney announced Thursday at the company's investor day that Disney+ will be available starting on November 12 for $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year.The new service will allow customers unlimited downloads so that content can be viewed offline.Iger also told analysts on Thursday that he would be stepping down in 2021 when his contract ends.The importance of Disney+ is difficult to understate both for Disney as a leading media empire as well as for Iger himself, who's postponed his retirement to see the project through.Iger, who's served as the company's chief executive since 2005, first announced in summer 2017 that Disney would introduce its own online streaming service.Though the decision will allow Disney to better take advantage of its extensive media hoard, it's also forced the company to make a huge bet that it can both terminate its profitable licensing relationship with Netflix and eventually compete with entrenched rivals.
Disney CEO Bob Iger says he will step down in 2021, a succession plan is forming:::::Disney CEO Bob Iger said that he is definitely stepping down from his post at the company in 2021."I'm expecting my contract to expire at the end of 2021," Iger said Thursday during Disney's investor day presentations."And I was going to say 'and this time I mean it,' but I've said it before.I've been CEO since October of 2005 and as I've said many times, there's a time for everything and 2021 will be the time for me to finally step down."Iger has extended his contract with Disney twice during his tenure.Once in 2018 and then through 2021, but it was contingent on the Fox deal closing.Since that merger has wrapped up, Iger will remain with the company as the head executive for the next two years."I've been engaged with the board for quite some time and there's discussion about a succession and they've been engaged in a succession process," Iger said."And we continue to feel that they will be able to identify my successor on a timely enough basis so this company has smooth transition."Iger has been instrumental in many of Disney's acquisitions, including Pixar in 2006, Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012.He has also pushed for the launch of Disney+, a streaming service filled with original movies and television shows as well as Disney's slate of classic animated and live-action content.There were rumors last month that Disney's internal restructuring was setting up two top executives as potential successors to Iger.Kevin Mayer, 55, the company's head of strategy, was named chairman of a new direct-to-consumer and international segment.And Robert Chapek, 58, head of parks, added consumer products to his oversight.Former consumer products head James Pitaro, 48, was named as the head of ESPN, but is considered a long shot for the role of CEO.
Helium is in short supply, hitting balloons and scientific research:::::Currently, helium cannot be produced efficiently and economically.The few ways it can be harvested includes extraction from natural underground deposits, or from the production of natural gas in which helium is a byproduct.As helium is a very light gas, it has to be captured quickly, or it will float up into space.Three main sources produce some 75 percent of the world's helium sites in Qatar, Wyoming and Texas according to gas industry publication Gasworld.In fact the U.S. has for decades provided much of the world's supply.However, the U.S. government will be exiting the helium business, according to a 2013 law.The helium the government owns is in Texas, which is being depleted.There is no helium futures market, but a U.S. government auction carried out by the Bureau of Land Management last September saw crude helium prices jump a whopping 135 percent on-year for its 2019 delivery, according to Gasworld.It was the last auction of U.S. reserves to be sold to a private industry.Meanwhile, overall U.S. production has also fallen as the bureau has been rationing supply since February 2018 after a group of countries lead by Saudi Arabia announced an economic embargo of Qatar.That created chaos in the helium supply chain for weeks as roughly 30 percent of the global supply was taken off the market.While that has been resolved, new supplies that are supposed to come online have been delayed and unplanned plant outages have further impacted the market, wrote Phil Kornbluth, a veteran helium industry consultant.But demand from high-tech manufacturing, including demand from China, is also rising.In a market dominated by just a few sources, any disruption in the supply chain will have a magnified impact."The problem is, helium is being used up faster than it can be produced these days," wrote Anders Bylund, an analyst at Motley Fool in a recent note.
Cramer Remix: Bed Bath & Beyond is not a lost cause:::::CNBC's Jim Cramer on Thursday said it's time for "wholesale change" in Bed Bath & Beyond's management."The company still has a good balance sheet, $1 billion in cash, so I think it can be saved," the "Mad Money" host said."But I gotta tell you something: not with this management team."The home goods chain is grossly behind the new retail landscape, where it must compete with e-commerce disrupters such as Amazon, Cramer said.The company's "half-hearted initiatives," such as focusing on private-label brands, have not boosted the margins, and home furnishing and dcor is simply not working, he added."In 2016, [CEO Steven] Temares started telling us he'd made the stores more experiential to improve the shopping experience, but you wouldn't know it if you've been to a Bed Bath & Beyond lately," Cramer said.Activist investors, who buy large amounts of a certain stock to push major changes in that company, want Temares out.A number of groups are reportedly trying to leverage their share in Bed Bath & Beyond to change the board of directors, and the stock spiked on the news last month.The activists said that Bed Bath & Beyond lost 58% of its value during a same period that the S&P 500 has gained 342% and its retail peers increased 592%, Cramer noted."All of that pain is from the past five years," he said.To compete with Amazon's prices for identical products, Bed Bath & Beyond is trying to lure customers to its $29 loyalty program with 20% discounts and free shipping on internet orders, Cramer said."This strategy has been devastating for Bed Bath's gross margins what they make after the cost of goods sold which have fallen from 40% in 2012 to under 35% in the latest quarter," the host said.Get his full thoughts here
Disney+ streaming service will be available starting Nov. 12 for $6.99 a month:::::Disney said Thursday it will roll out its much anticipated Disney+ video streaming service on November 12, drawing on its deep catalog of content and offering up new shows featuring favorite characters from "Monsters Inc." to Marvel to "Star Wars."The service will cost subscribers $6.99 per month, or $69.99 per year, which is at the high end of what many analysts had expected."Today's presentation will show you where we're going, but also remind you that we are starting from a position of strength and optimism," CEO Bob Iger said during the company's investor day Thursday.Analysts had expected the service would cost $5 to $7 per month, which is around half of what Netflix costs for its standard HD plan.Disney had signaled that it intended for the platform to be much cheaper than its rival.Disney said it expects it will spend about $1 billion in 2020 on original content for the platform and $2 billion by 2024.The company is also forecasting it will have between 60 million and 90 million subscribers by the end of 2024.One-third of those subscribers will be domestic and two-thirds will be international, the company said.Analysts and investors will be keen to see if the revenue from subscribers will be able to outweigh the lost revenue from no longer licensing its content to third parties.Disney+ will debut in the United States, but the company said it "plans to be in nearly all major regions of the world within the next two years."Disney had also hinted that it is interested in bundling it with ESPN+ and Hulu, which it owns a 60% stake in.However, it's unclear if Disney+ will coexist with these other services, particularly considering 40% of Hulu is owned by Comcast (30%) and AT&T (10%).Here's what the Disney+ interface looks like on television screens: Disney said ahead of the meeting that it would not be commenting on the recently completed quarter or the current quarter.The company is due to report second quarter results on May 8 after the closing bell.So far, Disney has already confirmed a number of television series and films solely available on Disney+.For its Marvel brand, Disney will have four different live-action series featuring Scarlet Witch and Vision, Loki, Bucky Barnes (the Winter Soldier) and Sam Wilson (Falcon) and Hawkeye.Head of Marvel Kevin Feige said the Marvel series will connect directly to the cinematic universe and to each other.An animated series called "What If" will also be available on Disney+.It will explore hypothetical questions like: what would have happened if Peggy Carter had been given the super serum instead of Steve Rogers?Additionally, there will be two unscripted Marvel series.From Star Wars, head of Lucasfilm Kathleen Kennedy said "The Mandalorian" series would be available to fans at the launch of Disney+.Also in the works is a new season of "Star Wars Clone Wars" and a live-action show based on Cassian Andor and K2-SO from "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story."Pixar will produce a number of shorts for the subscription service, featuring characters like Forky and Bo Peep from the "Toy Story" films.It will also have a series based in the world of "Monster's Inc." called "Monsters at Work.""One of the things I am most excited about is that we have the unique opportunity to extend our stories with characters our audiences know and love as well as explore new types of storytelling and animation with emerging filmmakers and show it all exclusively on Disney+," Jennifer Lee, chief creative officer of Walt Disney Animation Studios, said.Additional originals on the platform will include a "High School Musical" series and a live-action film remake of "Lady and the Tramp."Disney+ will also be home to "Noelle," a Christmas film starring Anna Kendrick as the daughter of Santa Claus.It is set to arrive on the platform soon after launch.Also on the service will be a catalog of Disney's classic animated features and TV shows as well as live-action flicks and shows, including fan favorites like "Lizzie McGuire" and "Hannah Montana."National Geographic content will also find a home on Disney+, including a show called "The World According to Jeff Goldblum" and "Magic of the Animal Kingdom," an inside look at what goes on behind the scenes at that the veterinary offices at Disney theme parks Epcot and Animal Kingdom in Orlando, Florida.Additionally, Agnes Chu, senior vice president of content for Disney+, said all episodes of "The Simpsons" will appear on the services on day one.Other 20th Century Fox titles on Disney+ will include "The Sound of Music," "The Princess Bride" and "Malcolm in the Middle."All films released in 2019 will also be available on Disney+ as soon as their theatrical and home entertainment windows have closed."Frozen II" will also be available exclusively on the platform by the summer of 2020.The company said it will continue to release major motion pictures to theaters ahead of their appearance on the streaming service.Since 2006, Disney has released 44 films that have grossed more than $37 billion at the box office.The company also said that

Top US military officer responsible for space warns of an urgent danger: Junk:::::"If we keep creating debris in space, eventually we are going to get to the point where it's very difficult to find a place to launch, very difficult to find a place to put a satellite, to operate a satellite without having to maneuver it all the time to keep it away from debris.All of those things are complicated and have to be worked in an international perspective," he added.Hyten's comments come on the heels of India's successful anti-satellite missile test which created more than 250 pieces of space junk, according to U.S. Strategic Command assessments.Last month India shot down a satellite with an anti-satellite missile, joining an exclusive group of world powers with military space capabilities.Read more: India joined an exclusive club with its latest anti-satellite missile test here's what it means for the world While anti-satellite missiles are by no means new, only a few countries have been able to develop, test and prove the capability.Satellites make up the backbone of GPS, communications, intelligence and more making the ability to destroy spacecraft a coveted military strength.In the wake of the test, dubbed "Mission Shakti," India said that if debris was created from the event it would not pose a threat to space-based assets."The test was done in the lower atmosphere to ensure that there is no space debris.Whatever debris that is generated will decay and fall back onto the earth within weeks," Shambhu Hakki, a spokesperson for the Indian Embassy in Washington, wrote in an email.Although India's weapons test was conducted at the relatively low orbit of 300 km, the debris may "pose a threat" to anything in higher orbits, Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, told CNBC in a prior interview.The test's altitude is just below the orbit of the International Space Station, which circles the Earth at about 400 km up.A recently unclassified report from the National Air and Space Intelligence Center, or NASIC, explained how China conducted an anti-satellite test in 2007 that produced a great deal of space junk.At an altitude of about 800 km, China destroyed one of its own weather satellites with an anti-satellite missile.Although the test was successful, the satellite shattered into thousands of pieces, which continue to zip around in an orbital cloud of deadly debris."A huge percentage of the debris in low Earth orbit is still attributable to that one test," Frank Slazer, vice president of space systems at Aerospace Industries Association, told CNBC earlier this year.However, the test represents an unsettling trend for governments and corporations operating in space, as risk increases that valuable assets "could be third-party victims" of nations demonstrating military capabilities in space."The more tests like this happen then the more risk there is that there could be impacts on either [rockets] going to space or satellites in low Earth orbit," Slazer said.Meanwhile, India's Hakki also maintained that the country is against the weaponization of outer space and "has no intention of entering into an arms race in outer space."The latest revelations from India, however, come as the United States, China and Russia sprint to equip their arsenals with anti-satellite missiles.In October, CNBC learned that a never-before-seen missile photographed on a Russian MiG-31 interceptor is believed to be a mock-up of an anti-satellite weapon that will be ready for warfare by 2022.The Russian anti-satellite weapon, which is attached to a space launch vehicle, is expected to target communication and imagery satellites in low Earth orbit, according to one source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.For reference, the International Space Station and the Hubble Space Telescope travel in low Earth orbit.Images of the mysterious missile on a modified MiG-31, a supersonic near-space interceptor, appeared in mid-September.
Macy's CEO responds to Jeff Bezos: We put our tax savings back into our employees:::::Macy's used its savings from 2018 tax reform to create a "path for growth," CEO Jeffrey Gennette told CNBC Thursday.The message came in response to Jeff Bezos' challenge that retailers match Amazon's employee compensation."We decided to put [our tax savings] back into the community of our colleagues," Gennette told Jim Cramer in an interview on "Mad Money.""Every single colleague all 130,000 [got] a quarterly bonus as a result of the production of that store [or] that call center."Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO who is also the world's richest man called on competitors in his annual shareholder letter Thursday to match the company's $15 minimum pay and benefits.Gennette said that Macy's understands that "culture is everything" in the workplace and that the company must take care of its staff."This is something we are hyper-focused on," he said.Macy's is also focused on transitioning its stores to reclaim patrons it lost to online shopping, such as Amazon.Gennette said it's critical that retail stores evolve into centers where customers can spend time and not just their money.The shopping mall stalwart has carved out about 1,500-square-feet of space at dozens of locations to introduce Story, the New York merchandise curator that Macy's bought about a year ago.The concept was founded by Rachel Shechtman to design design a catalog of items based on a theme that changes every two months."Brick-and-mortar needs to go from a place of transaction to a place of experience," he said in a Thursday interview with "Mad Money's" Jim Cramer."Story is one of our first steps in really doing that at scale."The idea is to complement longstanding experiences that Macy's offers, such as the annual Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City and other special events, Gennette said.As opposed to piloting the new Story model in a handful of locations, Macy's got it running in 36 stores in eight months, he added."That's the speed that we're now trying to work at in the company," Gennette said."This thing could scale to a lot more doors and ... [which] is really where I'm focused, so I've got many new mechanisms by which I can bring experiences and involve all five senses into our building."Macy's has also made moves to get its balance sheet in shape.Management has worked to shave $2.5 billion off the company's debt in the last four years, Gennette said.He also said leadership is in discussion to buy back stocks in the future, along with its plans to reinvest cash into the company.Macy's has a "funding the future" plan with four growth pillars in same-store sales, market share, franchise health, and profitability, Gennette said.Going forward, Macy's wants to avoid the problems that plagued holiday sales in its fourth-quarter earnings."We've got all these efficiencies and productivity buckets that we're playing with, because we're going to keep growing the top line, but overtime, we're going to show how we're going to grow the bottom line as well," he said.
Bank stocks could rally on the 'slightest' good news in earnings reports, Jim Cramer says:::::The banking sector will set the tone for earnings season when the group begins delivering quarterly results on Friday, CNBC's Jim Cramer said Thursday."The banks are the group that sets the tone for earnings season, and that's a lucky thing because this time their stocks are coming in ice cold, which means that they should be able to rally on even the slightest positive provocation," the "Mad Money" host said.Investors are trying to anticipate the results, Cramer said.The Dow Jones Industrial Average shaved off about 14 points and the Nasdaq Composite lost more than 16 points.The S&P 500, however, was virtually unchanged during the session."The fear is palpable that earnings could be down year-over-year, but no one wants to leave the table because stocks are still the only game in town," he said."Even though we've had a real slowdown since the Fed's last rate hike, the alternative to stocks the bond market once again offers only paltry returns."Cramer revealed what he expects to hear from the major banks: J. P. Morgan Chase: Chase reports before the market open on Friday.The stock is up $15 from its December lows.Cramer recommends buying the premier bank while its at a 3% yield.CEO Jamie Dimon could have good news for shareholders, Cramer said.Wells Fargo: Wells Fargo will also report quarterly results Friday morning, and it could be a better buy than J.P. Morgan with its share price up just about $4 per share from its December lows, Cramer said.The $47 stock price is cheap, trading at nine-times earnings with a 3.8% yield, he said.Although the bank has been operating under an interim CEO since Tim Sloan's departure last month, the host suggests buying in before a permanent CEO is installed."As a devotee of Tim Sloan, the now-retired chief executive who fell on his sword to protect the company from bad PR, I've gotta say, it's not like he quit when the going was tough.He has left his successor with a clean bank that's returned to growth in a very short period of time," Cramer said."You're going to hear that Warren Buffett, the bank's biggest shareholder, likes the new choice and that's gonna bring in buyers."Goldman Sachs: Goldman Sachs plans to give its earning report Monday morning.Cramer expects the investment bank will reveal an "amazing number" that won't budge the stock, which closed less than $203 on Thursday.The Malaysian fraud scandal and corresponding fines need to be resolved before the share price can climb back towards $262, Cramer said, but it's hard to believe that it will plummet on bad news.It could be worth owning.Citigroup: Citigroup will come out with results before the market opens Monday.The bank has fallen into a habit of missing numbers and buying back stock, Cramer noted.Shareholders want to see that Citigroup can still grow, he said.Bank of America: Bank of America is slated to release its latest earnings prior to the bell on Tuesday.Cramer noted the stock is $2 off its 52-week high.The bank would have to deliver a huge upside surprise for it to rally, and the security is at 10-times earnings, which is more expensive than most of its peers, he said.Morgan Stanley: The investment bank will present its quarterly earnings before the market opens Wednesday.Cramer said this one has the most potential to surprise investors with good numbers.He has faith in the CEO."CEO James Gorman has gotten this place humming after a less-than-stellar previous quarter," the host said."I have rarely seen a chief executive who seems more motivated to crush the numbers this quarter than this man."
A Fed appointment is not a 'political prize,' says JP Morgan Chase International chairman:::::There should never be a political appointment to the Federal Reserve, J.P. Morgan Chase International chairman Jacob Frenkel told CNBC on Thursday."Central bank independence is one of the most important pillars of economic policy that can generate stability, and the absence of it can generate instability," he said in an interview with Sara Eisen on "Closing Bell."Frenkel was specifically asked about businessman Herman Cain and conservative economist Steven Moore, both picks of President Donald Trump to fill open seats on the Fed's board.Neither have been formally nominated, but both men share Trump's philosophy for the economy and the direction of interest rates, Vice President Mike Pence said in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday."Especially in the modern era, with capital markets being so complex, being a Fed governor or being in general a central banker is a profession," Frankel said."It's not a political prize or medal for somebody who supported somebody else.The stakes are very, very high."
SpaceX launches Falcon Heavy and lands all three rocket boosters for the first time:::::SpaceX launched the company's Falcon Heavy rocket on its inaugural commercial mission on Thursday evening.This was the second flight for Falcon Heavy, which became the most powerful rocket in use in the world after SpaceX's successful test flight in February 2018.That launch was purely demonstration Thursday represents the first revenue-generating flight of Falcon Heavy.Falcon Heavy launched from SpaceX's launchpad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.Built out of three of the company's Falcon 9 rockets, Falcon Heavy's three cores stand side by side to create a 27-engine colossus.Together, those engines create about 5.1 million pounds of thrust.A few minutes after liftoff, the three lower "booster" stages of the rocket separated, flipped and return to Earth.The side boosters on each side of the rocket returned to SpaceX's concrete pads on the Florida coastline and the larger center booster went to the company's autonomous barge in the Atlantic Ocean.During the demonstration flight the center booster ran out of fuel and crashed in the water.But, for Thursday's flight, all three boosters landed successfully.
Alphabet's investment in Uber has multiplied by 20-fold since 2013:::::Six years after making what at the time was its largest venture investment ever, Google's $258 million bet on Uber has multiplied by about 20-fold to be worth more than $5 billion.According to Uber's IPO prospectus filed on Thursday, Google parent Alphabet owns a 5.2 percent stake in the ride-sharing company.With Uber reportedly looking to go public at a $100 billion valuation, Alphabet's shares are worth about $5.2 billion, though that number could fluctuate wildly between now and the lock-up expiration six months after the IPO.Alphabet is emerging as one of the big winners in the ride-hailing boom, even though the company is viewed as a potential competitor in the space once self-driving cars hit the market.Alphabet also invested $500 million in Uber arch-rival Lyft through its late-stage investment arm, CapitalG, in October 2017.Its 5.3 percent stake in Lyft is worth $783 million as of Thursday's close.Alphabet is also locked into those shares until 180 days after last month's IPO.While Alphabet is turning a handsome profit from its Uber investment, the two companies are hardly allies.David Drummond, Alphabet's senior vice president of corporate development and chief legal officer, had an Uber board seat until 2016, when he left because of growing competition in self-driving technology.The following year Alphabet sued Uber, claiming the ride-sharing company had stolen trade secrets when it acquired a self-driving technology start-up built by former Google executive Anthony Levandowski.The case was settled last February, and Uber agreed to pay Waymo a 0.34 percent equity stake, which at the time amounted to about $245 million.Those shares account for about 7 percent of Alphabet's current stake in Uber.There's also a big business relationship between the companies.From the beginning of 2016 through 2018, Uber paid Google $58 million for map services as well as $631 million for marketing and advertising services and $70 million for technology infrastructure and enterprise services.WATCH: Uber files to IPO on the NYSE
Uber paid Google $58 million over three years for map services:::::Google is noted as a key supplier of mapping technology to Uber in the ride-sharing company's IPO filing, which became available on Thursday."We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform," Uber said in the filing.Google Maps technology appears when a person enters a destination in the Uber app; the technology shows the current place, the destination and a route, along with estimates of arrival times.Uber said that it entered into an agreement with Google around map services in October 2015."From January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, we have paid Google an aggregate of approximately $58 million pursuant to this agreement," Uber said.Shortly after the agreement was signed, Uber hired Manik Gupta, then the director of product management for Google Maps; Gupta is now Uber's chief product officer.In 2015 Uber acquired mapping start-up deCarta for an undisclosed sum.The start-up's CEO, J. Kim Fennell, today is Uber's head of product partnerships and U.S. and Canada business development; he is the person who signed two contracts with Google for mapping technology on behalf of Uber.It looks like the deal will continue for some period of time, as Uber does not see a viable alternative.It wrote: "We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate.We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable."Uber also said between the beginning of 2016 and the end of 2018 it paid Alphabet's affiliates around $631 million for marketing and advertising services.Additionally, Uber uses Google's public cloud in addition to Amazon Web Services, an Uber spokesperson said.The two companies have a tangled history.In 2013, Google invested more than $250 million in Uber through its early-stage venture arm, GV, formerly known as Google Ventures.Alphabet still owns more than 5% of Uber's outstanding shares through that investment, according to the S-1.Google executive David Drummond took a seat on Uber's board at the time.But the two companies gradually started to compete in various areas, including self-driving technology, and Drummond left the board in 2016.Then Alphabet sued Uber in 2017, claiming that Uber had stolen trade secrets when it acquired a self-driving technology start-up built by another former Google exec, Anthony Levandowski.The case was settled last February, and Uber agreed to pay Waymo a 0.34 percent equity stake, which at the time amounted to about $245 million.Alphabet took a stake in Uber arch-rival Lyft as the lawsuit with Uber was still going on, and owned more than 5% of that company when it went public lat month.WATCH: Uber CEO: We're focusing on what we can control within our business
Travis Kalanick, who was ousted from Uber, will be worth billions:::::Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, who was booted almost two years ago from the ride-hailing business he built into a global behemoth, still owns 8.6 percent of the company, a stake that could be worth close to $9 billion.Kalanick owns 117.5 million shares of Uber, making him the third-biggest stakeholder, behind SoftBank and Benchmark, according to the company's IPO prospectus filed Thursday.With the company poised to debut at a valuation that could reach $100 billion, Kalanick is set to become one of the world's 200 richest people.It's been a rocky road to riches for Kalanick, who was celebrated in Silicon Valley for helping start Uber in 2009 and for pioneering a new industry that aimed to modernize the taxi experience for the smartphone era.Kalanick raised billions of dollars for Uber from some of the most notable tech investors to expand the business across the globe and build out a complicated infrastructure that also put the company squarely in the food delivery and shipping markets.But a host of controversies involving the company's culture, its treatment of drivers, and its failure to investigate and disclose abuse claims from riders, as well a high-profile legal fight with Alphabet over self-driving car technology, eventually left Kalanick in conflict with his board and top shareholders.Partners at top backer Benchmark demanded his resignation in 2017.While Kalanick is still on the board, he's left any functional role at the company and is now running a venture fund he started called 10100 (ten one hundred).Kalanick, like other insiders, will have to wait six months before he can turn that paper profit into real money because of the post-IPO lockup period.The market could swing wildly during that period for any number of reasons.Rival Lyft is trading well below its $72 initial public offering price from last month, leaving some insiders on edge.But Kalanick has already realized some of his gains after selling $1.4 billion worth of stock to SoftBank in early 2018.That transaction was part of a larger deal that made SoftBank the company's biggest shareholder with 16 percent ownership, followed by Benchmark at 11 percent.WATCH: Here's how Uber compares to Lyft
J. Crew is considering an IPO for its Madewell clothing brand:::::J.Crew is exploring a potential initial public offering for its faster growing brand Madewell, the company said in a release Thursday.The IPO for the preppy fashion retailer could happen as early as "the second half of 2019."J.Crew said the move is a part of its initiative to "maximize value, position both the J.Crew and Madewell brands for long-term growth, and deleverage and strengthen the Company's balance sheet."The clothing company carries a debt load exceeding $1.7 billion, according to a Reuters report.J.Crew's top priority this year is to return its flagship brand to profitability and sustain momentum for its quickly growing Madewell apparel business."We believe a potential IPO of Madewell, which had another record year of performance in 2018, could unlock significant value and generate meaningful proceeds that would strengthen our balance sheet and increase our overall financial flexibility to address our 2021 debt maturities, giving us an improved platform to support J.Crew's turnaround and allowing Madewell to achieve its full potential over the long-term," said Michael Nicholson, its interim CEO, in a statement Thursday.Nicholson, who has served as the company's president and chief operating officer, was named interim CEO Thursday.Previously the company was led by a team of four executives, who comprised the office of the CEO.That structure has been in place since Nov. 2018.Jack Weingart, co-managing partner of TPG Capital, was named to J.Crew's board, replacing Carrie Wheeler, who will be transitioning off the board after eight years with the company.The CEO of Madewell, Libby Wadle, will continue with the company, as will Lynda Markoe, who is its chief administrative officer.Nicholson and Wadle will report to the board.The fourth member, Adam Brotman, chief experience officer, will resign for personal reasons.Brotman departs on April 19."With debt maturities on the horizon in 2021 and very high leverage, J.Crew faces an elevated risk of a second financial restructuring after its 2017 debt exchange," said Moody's Vice President Raya Sokolyanska, in an email.Sokolyanska noted that Madewell generates less than a quarter of the company's revenue, but it has shown same-store sales growth at a time when J.Crew's brand was posting declines."If executed, a Madewell IPO could improve the capital structure and better position the company to address its debt," she said.Last month, Reuters reported that J.Crew tapped restructuring lawyers for the second time in as many years to explore options for reworking its billions in debt, as the U.S. clothing chain struggles with falling sales and a dwindling cash pile.J.Crew hired restructuring attorneys at Weil, Gotshal & Manges, the law firm that helped negotiate a previous debt workout for the company and most recently steered department store operator Sears through bankruptcy proceedings.A bankruptcy filing is not on the horizon for J.Crew, sources told Reuters.J.Crew faces stiff competition in the retail space, from the rise of more casual athleisure apparel to e-commerce firms such as Amazon that have squeezed an array of traditional retailers.The New York-based retailer has been private since 2011 when TPG Capital and Leonard Green & Partners completed a leveraged buyout for $3 billion.J.Crew's announcement also comes of the heels of the highly anticipated Levi's IPO, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange last month.
GAO: Cost for president's new 23-helicopter fleet drops $234M:::::A developmental Sikorsky VH-92A helicopter conducts landing and take-off testing at the White House South Lawn on September 28.The aircraft was the first of six test aircraft developed under the engineering and manufacturing development phase.Photo by Sgt.Hunter Helis/ U.S. Marine Corps April 12 (UPI) -- The cost to replace the U.S. president's aging helicopter fleet is some $234 million less than budgeted in 2014, the Government Accountability Office said.As of last May, the total acquisition costs for the Sikorsky VH-92A presidential helicopter program were estimated at $4.95 billion, which is a 4.5 percent decline from the $5.18 billion estimated in April 2014, GAO said in a report released Thursday.That equates to a cost of about $215 million for each of the 23 helicopters.The VH-92 is configured from Sikorsky's S-92.Twelve nations have selected the S-92 helicopter for their critical heads of state, according to Lockheed Martin, which owns Sikorsky."The president relies on a fleet of helicopters for transportation that has been in service for decades," the GAO said about the aircraft, which is known as Marine 1 when the president is aboard.The Navy plans to replace the current Marine Corps fleet of 19 helicopters -- the VH-3D, which entered service in 1978, and VH-60N aircraft, which arrived in 1987.Dwight D. Eisenhower was the first president to travel on a helicopter, the Bell UH-13J Sioux, in 1957.Initial delivery is scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2020, with production ending in fiscal year 2023.Among the estimated savings, approximately $88 million can be attributed to efficiencies during development and $103 million to revised spare parts cost and equipment production list.Also, $36 million comes from lower than expected inflation rates, the GAO said."A key factor in controlling total program acquisition cost has been performance requirements stability," the report said."The Navy has not added any key performance requirements to the fixed-price contract, thereby limiting cost growth.In addition, the Navy and the contractor have been able to limit the number of necessary design changes that require modifications to aircraft."But the development has been pushed back by Sikorsky.Milestone C review to authorize low-rate initial production was delayed from last January to June this June.The initial operational test and evaluation start has been pushed back from October to March 2020.An initial operational capability decision is three months later than initially expected in October 2020, "The VH-92A program continues to face development challenges that could affect Sikorsky's ability to deliver fully capable aircraft prior to the start of initial operational test and evaluation," according to the GAO report.In 2018, the GAO found the helicopter hadn't met a capability requirement for landing without damaging the landing zone, including the White House South Lawn.Sikorsky plans to have a solution for this performance requirement by November 2020.In addition, the VH-92A program has experienced problems connecting the aircraft's communication system to secure networks because of changes in network security requirements.The Navy anticipates a fix by January 2020."These changes are expected to be incorporated into the four production representative helicopters being built under the development contract in time for the program's initial operational test and evaluation," the GAO said.Sikorsky VH-92A program director Spencer Elani noted the first two helicopters were delivered on time to the government.They are now in the government test program."Sikorsky is confident the Defense Acquisition Board will soon issue a positive Milestone C decision for the VH-92A program to enter into production," Sikorsky VH-92A program director told Vertical publication in a statement."Sikorsky is pleased a recent agency review noted the excellent teamwork and open communication between the government and industry team building the next generation presidential helicopter."The GAO, which does not make recommendations in this report, plans to continue monitoring potential cost growth and schedule delays.
U.S. Defense officials lay out plans for Space Force:::::A United Launch Alliance Delta IV rocket lifts off at 6:56 PM from Launch Complex 37 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., on March 15.The Wideband Global SATCOM Satellite was sent to a geostationary orbit to provide improved communications capability to the U.S. military.File poto by Joe Marino-Bill Cantrell/UPI | License Photo April 12 (UPI) -- Top Defense Department officials have detailed plans to develop the Space Force, including a massive network of satellites, recognizing that the "status quo is not sufficient" to confront adversaries in outer space.Acting Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan on Thursday appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee with Marine Corps Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson; and Air Force Gen. John Hyten, commander of U.S. Strategic Command.For the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, Shanahan asked the committee to authorize the U.S. Space Force in the Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act."America has enduring interests in space," Shanahan said."And just as the U.S. Navy ensures freedom of navigation of the seas, America's Space Force must now ensure the freedom to navigate the stars."In March, the Defense Department requested $143.3 billion for space-based defenses out of a total $718.3 billion in a strategy that "fully recognizes that future wars will be waged not just in the air, on the land, and at sea, but also in space and cyberspace, increasing the complexity of warfare.It modernizes capabilities across all warfighting domains to enhance lethality."Specifically, it would cost $200 billion over five years to develop the Space Force.Although the United States remains dominant in space, including from a military perspective, the officials warned that adversaries Russia and China are gaining ground.In April, high-level officials testified before the committee on the importance of increased defense spending in the Pentagon's budget request for next year."Last month, I testified before you that China and Russia had developed capabilities to contest our ability to operate in all domains," Dunford said Thursday."This includes space, which is now a fully contested warfighting domain along with sea, air, land and cyberspace."The two nations,recognizing the benefits of space in the economic and military spheres, have worked to challenge the United States in space.That includes reorganizing their armed forces and developing robust space-based capabilities, included based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance."These steps provide the ability to more effectively target U.S. and allied forces," Dunford said."China and Russia are also capable of searching, tracking and characterizing satellites in all Earth orbits in support of space and counter-space operations."Shanahan said they are concerned "the next major conflict may be won or lost in space.""There is widespread agreement the status quo is not sufficient: Change is required to stay ahead," Shanahan told the senators."Approached correctly, this is an opportunity for a generational improvement.Future space capabilities should be system engineered from the start to include launch, commercial innovation, the network, the satellite, the ground segment, user equipment and cybersecurity."The United States, he said, needs to change its organizational setup."Space is no longer a sanctuary," Dunford said."Traditionally, the Air Force has been the principal driver of our efforts in space ... and our capabilities in space are second to none.But our current organizational construct was built before space was a contested domain."Last June, President Donald Trump directed the Department of Defense to create a sixth branch of the military -- a Space Force.In February, Trump signed a directive ordering the Department of Defense to to put together legislation to present to Congress to create the Space Force, initially as part of the Air Force.The Defense Department has decided to establish U.S. Space Command for operational control, and then establish the U.S. Space Force."Taking the next step to create the Space Force will allow us to develop and maintain a singular focus on developing the people, the capabilities, the doctrine and the culture we'll need to maintain our competitive advantage in space," Dunford said.That includes creating the Space Development Agency, which will develop and deliver the next generation of space-based communications and Earth observation.Existing organizations continue current efforts, Shanahan told the senators."We need to outpace the threats in space, not simply keep up with them," the secretary said."Because our current system isn't organized to move fast enough, the Space Force will consolidate, elevate, and focus our efforts for results."SDA is first planning a "transport layer" of about 650 small, inexpensive low-Earth orbit satellites that will transfer data between space and ground assets.The first one could be in orbit as early as 2022.Then a "tracking layer" of about 200 satellites to provide global coverage of advanced missile threats using infrared imaging could be rolled out.They would use radar, electro-optical/infrared cameras and signals intelligence to sense and monitor objects on Earth."Other layers will follow on deployment timelines of two years and perhaps even less," Fred Kennedy, the newly named director of the office, said Wednesday at Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colo. "We wish to emulate the smartphone and computer industry's approach to upgrades," Kennedy said.We are not building exquisite systems intended to last a decade or more.To the extent possible, we will be buying and building commodities which we can then replace or upgrade on short order."The "advanced maneuvering vehicles" also would be developed.Kennedy said they could include an advanced space plane like a X-37 successor or another spacecraft.It could be able to move between the Earth and the moon more quickly and efficiently than an adversary's weapons.Wilson, whose Space Force would be a separate branch of the Air Force, has criticized the plans."Launching hundreds of cheap satellites into theater as a substitute for the complex architectures where we provide key capabilities to the war fighter will result in failure on America's worst day if relied upon alone," she said.Kennedy said that Wilson is addressing how to balance funding for proliferated constellations of smaller satellites with the more costly technologies needed to "protect and defend" large satellites.If there is a space-based infrared system in a geosynchronous satellite, "you're not going to just write it off, you're going to say how can I protect and defend that system," Kennedy said.But if there are less-expensive proliferated satellites in LEO [low-earth orbit} that can also conduct the missile warning functions that SBIRS does, "we may write that off to a certain extent."He added: "I'd like to give our adversary that problem to go solve."Legislators were skeptical about plans to create a new military branch.Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the Republican committee chairman, asked the defense officials "this organization fix?"And Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the committee's top Democrat, said changes need to be made but "creating a new branch of the armed forces for the first time in 70 years is not a decision Congress should make lightly.Such a major reorganization would have long-lasting consequences, both intended and unintended."

Natalie Combs were facing court-martial trials tied to the fatal June 17, 2017, collision, but will receive the letters instead, the U.S. Navy announced Wednesday night."The Navy will always keep the lost sailors and their families in its thoughts and prayers," the Navy said Wednesday.Navy Secretary Richard V. Spencer made his decision based on the recommendation of Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson."This decision is in the best interest of the Navy, the families of the Fitzgerald sailors and the procedural rights of the accused officers," the Navy said."Both officers were previously dismissed from their jobs and received non-judicial punishment."The families of the seven sailors who died in the collision were notified in a letter that stated "the cases are being dismissed for legal reasons that impede the continued prosecution of either officer," USNI News reported.The Navy had limited options in finding a consolidated disposition authority to oversee Benson's case because Director of Naval Reactors Adm. Frank Caldwell was disqualified.The judge ruled Caldwell "abdicated his neutral role in favor of a prosecutorial role" and made prejudicial statements in other cases.RELATED HII delivers destroyer USS Paul Ignatius to Navy The naval officers eligible to pursue charges against Benson were the chief of naval operations and vice chief of naval operations.The ruling made it "highly improbable" that the case would move forward, retired Navy Capt.Lawrence B. Brennan, a legal expert, told Stars and Stripes."The announcement of this disposition completes a process that never included a trial of the facts," Lt. Cmdr.Justin Henderson said to USNI News."Despite a relentless messaging campaign insisting ships' commanding officers are strictly liable for all operational risks, the Navy never tested that concept in court.For good reason: it's untenable, legally and factually."RELATED USS Donald Cook leaves Black Sea after exercises In a late Wednesday statement to USNI, Combs' attorney, David Sheldon, said his client performed her duties to the best of her ability."LT Combs is obviously relieved that the charges will be dismissed," he said."She stands resolute in her belief that she did all she could have to perform her duties and was prepared to defend her honor.Today, she joins her shipmates in grieving the loss of these truly wonderful sailors."Deck officer Lt.Junior Grade Sarah Coppock pleaded guilty to one count of negligence in a court-martial in May 2018.Surface warfare coordinator Lt. Irian Woodley was recommended not to face trial by a military judge and instead an administrative board of inquiry opted not to separate him from service.The Navy said it is working to prevent further incidents of this type."The comprehensive program to improve Navy readiness and training, to do everything possible to ensure that accidents like this will not recur, remains on track," the Navy said."The Navy continues to strive to achieve and maintain a climate of operational excellence."Seven sailors died aboard the Fitzgerald when it collided with the Philippine-flagged container ship ACX Crystal off the coast of Japan on June 17,2017.Crew fatigue was a factor in the incident.Two months later on Aug. 21, the USS John McCain, another Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, ran into a merchant ship east of the Straits of Malacca and Singapore, killing 10 sailors.The two top commanders on the vessel were relieved of duty.The Navy concluded both accidents were "avoidable" and caused by multiple human errors.The Government Accountability Office in a 163-page report released in December 2017 found the McCain and the Fitzgerald had several expired training certifications and lapsed requirements -- some for more than two years.The Fitzgerald went to Dry Dock 4 at Fleet Activities Yokosuka in Japan after the accident.In November 2017, the destroyer was further damaged by two punctures to its hull during the loading process to Dockwise heavy-lift ship MV Transshelf to Huntington Ingalls Industries' shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss.

"We're excited to finally finish developmental testing after the 'pause' caused by Hurricane Michael.This test marks a major milestone in delivering this capability to the fleet," lead project engineer Joe Thomas said in news release Monday.Findings from a final report will be used for future performance improvements of the system.RELATED Iran unveils submarine that can launch cruise missiles The C-variant of the Q-20 includes upgraded acoustic array technology with an integrated, electro-optic identification sensor."This is a multi-modal search sonar," Thomas said."When you put the Q-20C sonar sensor in the water, it looks down, to each side, and is also forward-looking.... With the latest improvements, it's essentially looking everywhere in the surrounding volume of water."Thomas said previous versions of the sensor needed to swap the volume-search module for an electro-optic identification module.Raytheon produces the AN/AQS-20, which incorporates four separate sonars in a compact, lightweight and hydro-dynamically stable towed body.The sonars, using signal processing and computer algorithms, provide real-time, computer-aided detection and classification against the full spectrum of threat mines.The system also provides the operator with a visual image and a contact data list."By reducing the size of the platform and the number of crew required to deploy the system, the AN/AQS-20 safely and efficiently consolidates expansive mine-sweeping operations that previously required a large warfare ship manned by more than 80 crew members," Raytheon said on its website.The Panama City site is considered the nation's premier technical center for mine warfare and mine countermeasures.The subject matter experts partnered with Q-20C post mission analysis operators during this phase of development testing to evaluate the system performance with these latest improvements.Plans are for the sonar to be integrated with its intended tow platform in a mine warfare and mine countermeasures' unmanned surface vehicle, in Fiscal Year 2020.The MCM USV, which was designated on Oct. 8, 2018, is a long endurance, semi-autonomous, diesel-powered, all-aluminum surface craft that supports the employment of various MCM payloads.Post mission analysis operators also are optimistic about the Q-20C's potential future naval capabilities."As part of the Littoral Combat Ship's MCM Mission Package, this sensor, when deployed by the MCM USV, can help to clear minefields," Aerographer's Mate Chief Petty Officer Larry Pacquer said."Once integrated with its intended tow platform, the Q-20C has the potential to facilitate ships safe passage through maritime channels," Mineman Petty Officer First Class Jonathan Roden said."It's going to be technologies like these that will enable the Navy to remove Sailors from the minefields."

Photo by Cpl.Joseph Sorci/ U.S. Marine Corps April 8 (UPI) -- The U.S. Marines' M1A1 Abrams tanks have successfully performed with several 3D-printed impellers.The Marine Corps Systems Command and other organizations reviewed the performance of impellers used on the tanks at Twentynine Palms, Calif., last December and January, according a Marines news release Thursday.After about 100 hours of testing on Abrams tanks during these exercises in Camp Pendleton in California, Marines at Twentynine Palms disassembled the impellers to check for unusual wear, leakage or other problems.None existed.The Marines, like other military branches, see 3D printing as a quicker way replace worn-out original parts and spare the expense of creating special orders."Call it a spare tire or a stop-gap solution,"Joseph Burns, technical lead for MCSC's Advanced Manufacturing Operations Cell, said in a news release."This can get you through a mission, through your training exercise or whatever may be critical at the time."On tanks, an impeller expels dust from the engine to keep the filters clean.But when the part begins to wear and tear, it might not pull enough air to function properly and reduce effectiveness.A few years ago, Defense Logistics Agency did not have enough impalers to satisfy all orders with the Marine Corps and the Army."At certain times, logistical issues can occur," said Tony Delgado, research and development program manager for additive manufacturing at DLA."Sometimes, the part is not available right away or something happens with a vendor and a part cannot be provided immediately.This was one of those times where the part wasn't available."And it can take from six to 10 months for the Marines to receive a part."Around that time, the Marine Corps had been provided with 3D printing additive manufacturing tools," Burns said."And Marines were being encouraged to be innovative and develop prototype solutions to real-world problems.A young Marine identified the impeller and began exploring ways to 3D print this part."MCSC collaborated with Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory and DLA to check the the performance of the 3D printed impeller."Right now, we don't see any reason why the 3D-printed impeller is any less reliable than the OEM version," Burns said."We plan to continue to collect operational hours on three 3D-printed impellers to better assess the long-term reliability of the part."Once the 10-page technical data package is finalized, the 3D-printed impeller will be fully qualified, tested and certified by the Marine Corps for use in the Abrams tank."We've involved engineers from Marine Corps Systems Command and the Army, and we've even had lawyers in some meetings to ensure there's no intellectual property infringement," Delgado said."In terms of collaboration, this has been a great project."In 2017, a U.S. Marine Corps infantry battalion in Camp Lejuene, N.C., became the first unit in the Corps to possess a 3D printer, using it to print various pieces of equipment."We're at the tip of the iceberg as to what capabilities this can bring," Capt.Justin Carrasco, the logistics officer for the battalion, said in a press release."So right now, we're identifying different 3D-printed parts that can support the warfighter in the expeditionary environment."In January, Huntington Ingalls delivered a 3D-printed pipe assembly to be installed on the USS Harry S. Truman and evaluated for one year on the aircraft carrier.And earlier in January, a metallic 3D-printed part was installed on an operational F-22 Raptor at Hill Air Force Base in Utah for the first time.The 3D printing process has been used by private industry and government to make parts, including medical devices.Last week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Construction Engineering Research Laboratory tested a 3-foot-wide foot bridge in Champaign, Ill.It was designed withstand 15,000 pounds.It didn't crack under a hydraulic actuator until under the equivalent of nearly 45,000 pounds.Marines helped built the bridge in December at Camp Pendleton in California and were in Champaign last to help test the slabs.
Britain to deploy F-35Bs for first time, sending them to Cyprus air base:::::Two F-35B Lightning II fighter jets successfully landed onboard HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time on Nov. 19, 2018.Photo by Lt. Cmdr.Lindsey Waudby/ Royal Navy April 8 (UPI) -- Britain announced that it plans to deploy its F-35B aircraft for the first time later this year, sending them to Cyprus.The aircraft will leave from the home station of Royal Air Force Marham in Norfolk, Britain announced Monday, on their way to Royal Air Force Akrotiri in Cyprus.Britain plans for the jets to hit targets in Syria this summer, The Times reported last December.Britain currently owns 17 F-35B aircraft, and plans to procure 138 over the life of the program.The plane, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, first landed in West Norfolk in June 2018.The Lightning Force is jointly manned by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy."These formidable fighters are a national statement of our intent to protect ourselves and our allies from intensifying threats across the world," Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said."This deployment marks an important milestone in this game-changing aircraft's journey to becoming fully operational."This deployment is meant to give pilots and crews experience flying and maintaining the aircraft in an unfamiliar environment.Included in the overseas deployment is training and testing on all aspects of moving the aircraft to a new location, including logistics, maintenance and sustainment of all the equipment and crew."It is great to see 617 Squadron, the modern day Dambusters, flying the most advanced and dynamic fighter jet in the UK's history and about to start their first overseas deployment," said Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier."I have no doubt that this short deployment will offer many tests, but likewise I am confident that our highly trained and skilled personnel will rise to the challenge and confirm our ability to deliver truly formidable capability."The jet can operate from land and sea.It helps deliver a "carrier strike" capability to Britain from the Queen Elizabeth Class aircraft carriers."This first overseas deployment of these world-beating British F-35B aircraft to RAF Akrotiri, together with their embarkation in HMS Queen Elizabeth for the first time in the Autumn of this year, are important milestones to prove their readiness for deployed operations anywhere in the world in defense of our national interests," Adm. Sir Philip Jones, chief of Naval staff, said.The F-35's three main models are the F-35A with conventional takeoff and landing, the F-35B short take-off and vertical-landing, and the F-35C carrier-based catapult-assisted take-off but arrested recovery.In the U.S. military, the U.S. Marine Corps' F-35B reached initial operational capability July 31, 2015, with a squadron of 10 F-35Bs ready for world-wide deployment.The Air Force followed on Aug. 2, 2016, and the Navy on Feb. 28 of this year.

Davella III/ U.S. Navy April 8 (UPI) -- U.S. Navy ships won't participate in the 70th anniversary of the founding of China's People's Liberation Army Navy later this month, the Pentagon said.The U.S. Embassy's defense attache in Beijing will represent the United States in Qingdao from April 22 to 25, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Dave Eastburn told Stars and Stripes."The United States Navy will continue to engage the PLAN [People's Liberation Army Navy] through established military-to-military dialogues, such as the Military Maritime Consultative Agreement working groups and Rules of Behavior discussions," Eastburn said.The will include "a high-level seminar, an international fleet review, military tattoo performances and cultural and sports activities," ministry spokesman Senior Col. Wu Quian's said at a news conference last month."The U.S. government seeks a bilateral relationship that is results-oriented and focused on risk reduction," Eastburn told the Japan Times."The U.S. Navy will continue to pursue its primary goal of constructive, risk-reduction focused discourse with the PLAN."China plans to showcase its new nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines at the April 23 naval parade in the Yellow Sea near Qingdao."America's ships and sailors are needed across the Indo-Pacific," Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe, R-Okla, told the Free Beacon."America's Navy is busy enough confronting the challenges posed by China's aggression in the South China Sea and other critical aspects of great power competition without the distraction of participating in communist pageantry."The Pakistani navy also is unlikely to send warships to take part in parade after initially planning to send two ships, Hindustan Times reported.Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwakya said last month that the Maritime Self-Defense Force would send a destroyer.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has improved relations with China as U.S. President Donald Trump's relation is more strained."Japan has actually improved relations with China in substantial ways," Zhang Baohui, director of Lingnan University's Center for Asian Pacific Studies in Hong Kong, told Japan Times."Its foreign policies, under Abe and in the context of Tokyo's concerns for Trump's trade policies and alliance politics, have become more independent," he said.Two other U.S. allies -- South Korea and the Philippines -- are sending sending vessels, according to Japan Times.In Last April's naval review in the South China Sea, there were 48 vessels and 76 planes, including China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.But tensions have increased between the United States and China regarding Taiwan and the South China Sea.On March 31, China sent a fighter jet over the median line in the Taiwan Strait between mainland China and Taiwan.China's state-run media reported that it was meant to rebuke the United States, which has sent its Navy through the strait on freedom-of-navigation operations five times in the last six months "China firmly opposes any forms of official and military ties between the U.S. and Taiwan.We have made clear our stern position to the U.S. many times," Wu said at a March 28 news conference.The United States is committed to the One China policy, which acknowledges China's claim on Taiwan.In return, the United States doesn't officially recognize Taiwan.A 1979 law states that the United States will defend Taiwan from a mainland attack.China and the United States have been at odds over the 27 islands and reefs in the South China Sea.China has built military outposts on at least 12 of them since 2014.Those claims are not recognized by international law.Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and the Philippines all have competing interests there.Last year, the United States withdrew an invitation to China for Rim of the Pacific exercises off Hawaii in response to it actions in the South China Sea.
Leidos awarded $19.3M for work on laser weapon system:::::By 2021, the Air Force plans to test laser weapons from fighter jets to destroy high-value targets, conduct precision strikes and incinerate enemy locations from the sky.Rendering courtesy Kirtland Air Force Base April 8 (UPI) -- Leidos has been awarded a $19.3 million contract for system integration and field testing of a laser weapon system being developed at Kirtland Air Force base in New Mexico.The contract provides for advancing work on state-of-the-art of laser weapon system technology through research and development of laser weapon systems, as well as evaluate performance in relevant operational environments, the Air Force announced Friday.Work will be performed at Kirtland and is expected to be complete by April 22.Fiscal 2019 research, development, test and evaluation funds in the amount of $500,000 are being obligated at the time of the award.The Air Force Research Laboratory Directed Energy Directorate at Kirtland is the Air Force's only center of expertise for directed energy and optical technologies.The lab develops and transitions technologies in four core technical competencies: laser systems, high power electromagnetics, weapons modeling and simulation, and directed energy and electro-optics for space superiority."AFRL's laser programs are aiming to achieve a laser weapon system that can operate in all flight regimes against targets that are approaching at supersonic speeds, which must be intercepted at significant ranges," according to a 2016 Air Force Research Laboratory report, called "Speed of Light to the Fight by 2020."Laser weapons advantages were described with "scalable" effects.A 30kW laser can create "denial, degradation, disruption and destruction from UAS [drones] to small boats at a range of several kilometers," the report states."More powerful lasers have counter-air, counter-ground, and counter-sea applications against a host of hardened military equipment and vehicles at significant range," the AFRL report writes.The report details a three-pronged approach to development, starting with subsystems engineering, then low-power laser testing and finally extensive air and ground tests.RELATED Holloman Air Force Base receives notice for groundwater contamination By 2021, the Air Force plans to test laser weapons from fighter jets to destroy high-value targets, conduct precision strikes and incinerate enemy locations from the sky.The Air Force hopes to begin firing laser weapons from larger planes, including C-17s and C-130s, Fox News reported in December.Once the technology has proven successful, fighter jets such as the F-15, F-16 or F-35 can be utilized with it.A timetable hasn't been established for drone-fired lasers.Last October, Ball Aerospace and Technologies signed a deal for $36 million with the U.S. Air Force to provide solid state laser effects and modeling services at Kirtland.In August 2017, Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., announced that the Department of Defense is investing $17 million in directed energy laser weapons at the base in his state."With our state's unique expertise in directed energy work, this funding will jump start the deployment of this critical technology and bring more high-paying jobs to the state," said Heinrich, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee."This is an area where New Mexico can make yet another significant contribution to our nation's defense -- and in the process, we can see millions of dollars of investment and many new jobs in our state."Boeing conducts laser research at its Albuquerque facility and with the Air Force's Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M.
USSTRATCOM declares new nuclear command center at operational capability:::::The Enterprise Center of the Nuclear Command, Control and Communications Enterprise Center is located at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska as part of the U.S. Strategic Command.Photo courtesy of USSTRACOM April 5 (UPI) -- The U.S. Strategic Command has declared the new nuclear command center in Nebraska has reached initial operational capability.The center's readiness was determined Wednesday, according to an Air Force news release.The Nuclear Command, Control and Communications Enterprise Center, known as NC3, is located at Offutt Air Force Base.NC3 is involved in restructuring situation monitoring, decision-making, force direction, force management and planning.Offutt became the host base for the U.S. Strategic Command, known as USSTRATCOM, which was established in 1992 from the Strategic Air Command and the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff.It comprises the Army, Marines, Navy and Air Force branches.USSTRATCOM has taken over the modernization of NC3 from the Air Force Global Strike Command.Following the Pentagon's Nuclear Posture Review last May, the Defense Department decided to give it to STRATCOM, the combatant command that oversees the nation's nuclear forces.USSTRATCOM's responsibilities include strategic deterrence, nuclear operations, space operations, joint electromagnetic spectrum operations, global strike, missile defense, and analysis and targeting.In 2018, Secretary of Defense James Mattis appointed the commander of USSTRATCOM -- Gen. John Hyten -- to be the single operational lead for NC3, with increased responsibilities for operations, requirements and systems engineering and integration."The center was created to help break down stovepipes in NC3 operations across the Defense Department," Elizabeth Durham-Ruiz, USSTRATCOM NC3 Enterprise Center director, said in an Air Force news release."We want to bring a whole-of-government approach to NC3 as we focus on operations, requirements, systems engineering and integration and analytics for the entire enterprise."She manages more than $20 billion of on-orbit communications assets, as well as implementing communications and information policies across the command.The center is inside the command's headquarters in Nebraska, with a second location in the Washington, D.C. area."There are multiple organizations currently responsible for operating, procuring and building different elements of the NC3 enterprise," she told Space News."We want to bring a holistic focus on operations, requirements, systems engineering and integration, and analytics for the entire enterprise.The staff is small.We are leveraging the expertise in the military services and in the Office of the Secretary of Defense who have been doing a lot of these activities already."The Congressional Budget Office estimates the overhaul of the U.S. nuclear command, control and communications system will cost $77 billion.That is part of the $494 billion earmarked over the next decade to maintain and update nuclear forces."This is an exciting time for USSTRATCOM.We are laying the ground floor to develop the NC3 architecture of the future that will serve the nation for decades to come," said Vice Adm. David Kriete, USSTRACOM deputy commander.The NC3 is a classified system designed in the 1960s and 1970s during the height of the Cold War.An updated system is sought to handle the next generation of nuclear platforms: the B-21 stealth bomber, the Columbia-class strategic ballistic missile submarine and the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent intercontinental ballistic missiles."Gen. Hyten likes to talk about the fact that the architecture is very old but it's functioning amazingly well for as old as it is," Durham-Ruiz said."It's been through great effort that we have been able to keep this functioning as well as it has been.But in the future, of course, everything will have to be replaced."She said timelines have not been decided."After we develop the architecture, we have to work to define the individual parts and work through the services to ensure the technologies are purchased.That will be a long process," Durham-Ruiz said.
Sierra Nevada awarded $42.7M to train Afghan Air Force on A-29 Super Tucano:::::An A-29 Super Tucano taxis across the airfield at Hamid Karzai International Airport in Afghanistan, in January 2016.Photo by Tech.Sgt.Nathan Lipscomb/U.S.Air Force April 5 (UPI) -- Sierra Nevada Corp. has been awarded a $42.7 million contract for A-29 Super Tucano pilot and maintenance training for Afghanistan's Air Force.The contract is for five years, according to a Thursday announcement by the Department of Defense.The training, which is expected to be completed by Dec. 31, 2023, will be performed at Moody Air Base, Ga., and in Afghanistan.Fiscal 2019 building partner capacity/pseudo-foreign military sales funds in the amount of $5.6 million have been obligated at the time of award.The planes are built in Jacksonville, Fla., in a partnership between Sierra Nevada Corporation and Brazil's Embraer.More than 220 aircraft have been delivered to multiple nations, including the United States and Brazil, according to Embraer.The A-29 is "the most reliable and cost-effective solution for basic and advanced flight and combat training, close air support operations, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance counterinsurgency and irregular warfare scenarios," Taco Gilbert, senior vice president at Sierra Nevada, said in February in announcing a contract award of 12 A-29 planes to Nigeria.The A-29 Super Tucano, which includes room for a pilot and navigator, flew its maiden flight in June 1999.The plane can operate in Afghanistan's high temperatures and in extremely rugged terrain.With a highly maneuverable fourth-generation weapons system, it is capable of delivering precision guided munitions.Eight combat-ready Afghan pilots and some maintenance personnel graduated in 2015 after a year of training with the 81st Fighter Squadron at Moody Air Force Base, according to the U.S. Air Force.Following the training, the first four of Afghanistan's 20 A-29s were delivered to Hamid Karzai International Airport in January 2016 by the U.S. Air Force.The Afghan Air Force acquired the A-29 as a replacement for the Mi-35 attack helicopter, which the U.S. at the time called a "monumental leap in capabilities.""The A-29 program has been an integral part of the U.S. government's overall 'Building Partnership Capacity' efforts around the world and immediately supports the development of an indigenous air force in Afghanistan," Brig.Gen. Christopher Craige, commanding general at Train, Advise, Assist Command-Air, said at the time.As of May 11, 2018, A-29 Super Tucano pilots have supported approximately 30 Afghan ground missions, successfully dropping over 50 laser guided bombs on enemy targets, according to the U.S. Air Force.

Bush added 20,000 more troops into the country, mainly Baghdad, in January 2017.RELATED Trump awards fallen soldier with Medal of Honor Hook told reporters the United States continues to pressure Iran with sanctions."We are imposing costs on the regime for behaving as an outlaw expansionist regime," he said."The regime is weaker today than when we took office two years ago.Its proxies are also weaker.Unless the regime demonstrates a change in policy and behavior, the financial challenges facing Tehran will mount."

Pentagon wants more resources to counter Russia, China threats:::::A Patriot missile is fired at a shooting range in Daecheon, South Chungcheong Province, South Korea, in November 2017.The Pentagon wants to develop better technology and spend more money to counter threats from China and Russia.File Photo by Yonhap/EPA April 4 (UPI) -- The U.S. Defense Department is developing technology, including submarine-launched nuclear-tipped cruise missiles, to counter increasing threats from Russia and China, Pentagon officials told a Senate subcommittee.High-level officials appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee's strategic forces subcommittee Wednesday to describe the importance of increased defense spending in the Pentagon's budget request for next year.In March, the Defense Department requested $718.3 billion in a strategy that "fully recognizes that future wars will be waged not just in the air, on the land, and at sea, but also in space and cyberspace, increasing the complexity of warfare.It modernizes capabilities across all warfighting domains to enhance lethality."Although the spending remains near a record low as a share of the U.S. economy, the spending handles threats posed by China and Russia "through maintaining our competitive advantage.""In fiscal year 2020, we will continue to build a more lethal and ready Air Force, while fielding tomorrow's Air Force faster and smarter," Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David L. Goldfein said in a joint posture statement to the committee.The hearing was the third congressional appearance of the week by Wilson and Goldfein.The independent and bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission mentioned a vision for building "the Air Force we need.""Regardless of where the next conflict occurs or which adversary it features, the Air Force will be at the forefront," the Commission said.John C. Rood, the undersecretary of defense for Policy, described how adversaries are developing sophisticated ballistic and cruise missile systems that include increased speed, range, accuracy and lethality.He noted how an enemy's hypersonic glide vehicle maneuvers outside traditional trajectories, and is more difficult to track and destroy.The Defense Department wants an improved wide-area surveillance system to defend against cruise missiles.That includes enhancing the Aegis ballistic missile defense system by procuring Standard Missile-3 block IB and Block IIA missiles and integrating the SPY-6 radar as well as additional Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense interceptors, Patriot interceptors and the Army Indirect Fire Protection Capability command and control system.The Pentagon is specifically requesting money for a low-yield modification to an existing warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles and submarine-launched cruise missiles.Rood mentioned the missile when responding to a question from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., about the importance of low-yield tactical nuclear weapons to deter threats.He said the current "sub-launched cruise missile is further behind, and we're just doing an AoA or analysis of alternatives at this stage."The issue also was brought up at a House committee meeting last week.Rep. Susan Davis, D-Calif., said she was unconvinced such weapons are needed.Rood outlined several ways the Pentagon is beefing up it defensive posture.To deter Russia, they include more resources in Alaska: an additional 20 ground-based interceptors to 64, a new missile field at Fort Greely, and new discrimination radars in Alaska as well as Hawaii, and operations extended for the sea-based X-band radar.To defend against emerging threats, funding is sought for space-based defenses with $143.1 billion requested.That includes additional sensors, integrating kill assessment into the ballistic missile defense system, sustaining a space tracking and surveillance system, near-term sensor and command and control upgrades against hypersonic missiles, tests of SM-3 Black IIA capability against an ICBM-class target, the study of the practicality of interceptors, continued high-energy laser development and kinetic boost phase interceptors using a tactical air platform.In the budget breakdown, $9.6 billion is requested for cyber; $57.7 billion for air domain; $34.7 billion for maritime domain, including the largest shop building request in 20 years; $14.6 billion for ground systems, $31 billion for multi-domain and nuclear triad and $13.6 billion for missile defense.In innovation and technology, $3.7 billion is sought for drones, $927 million for artificial intelligence, $2.6 billion for hypersonic weapons development, The United States is not alone in beefing up defense.Rood said the Pentagon is working with NATO, Spain, Turkey, Romania, Poland, Gulf partners in the Middle East, Israel, Japan and other nations.

Land O'Lakes CEO Beth Ford, from the cornfield to the C-suite:::::Beth Ford's first job paid $2 an hour.Early in the morning, she climbed on the school bus to go detassel corn, joining other kids in Sioux City, Iowa, who did it as a summer job."Back then, two dollars an hour, that was real money," Ford tells CNN's Poppy Harlow in the latest episode of Boss Files Now, as the first female CEO of Land O'Lakes and the first openly gay female CEO in the Fortune 500 list of largest US companies Ford remembers a conversation with her mother years ago that taught her that "while we may not have everything, we have enough, and given what we have, much was expected of us.""She said, 'Do you understand what is expected of you?Do you understand how much you have?Don't disappoint,' and I was like, 'I've gotta work hard to not disappoint,'" Ford says.Ford has a vision for Land O'Lakes.She wants to transform people's perceptions of the butter and cream company and refocus attention on the efforts it's making in the ag-tech space."My vision is to continue to invest in technology," she says."You have to have agility.E-commerce and e-business and technology is disrupting all industries, including agriculture, and there's an opportunity when you have an insight-driven, technology-focused company, as I believe Land O' Lakes is."The future of Land O'Lakes In July, the United States slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports , a move China called the beginning of "the biggest trade war in economic history."In response, China imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of US exports, including cotton, dairy and soybeans."Grain farmers, growers, and producers across the US are all affected by the uncertainty churning around trade negotiations and retaliatory tariffs," Ford says."Export market access is critical to these farmers and the agriculture industry and we're seeing a slowdown due to uncertainty in the trade environment."Ford says she's spoken with soybean farmers and others concerned with the tariff politics."What I would tell you is that our farmer members are supportive in understanding that the administration is trying to do something on intellectual property theft," she says."They want to make sure that they have appropriate trade agreements, and I think that they're supportive."More than anything else, she says, these farmers need resolution and clarity quickly."Time is critical," she says."So then what's the most important thing the administration can do?They can move with speed and resolve these trade issues and resolve those tariff issues."Being a first When the announcement about Ford's promotion to CEO went out, the press release celebrated her achievements, but it made no special mention of an important "first" in Fortune 500 history.With Ford's promotion, she became the first openly gay female CEO to lead a Fortune 500 company.In the months since, she's heard from people about how much that "first" has meant to them."People have come up to me and said, 'Thank you,'" she says."And it's not just the LGBTQ community, it is just people in their normal life saying, 'Thank you for being your authentic self and encouraging others to do that.'"Ford says she's never faced discrimination in her career, but she's definitely considered its potential impact on herself and her family."I had made deliberate decisions for some places where I felt as though it may not be as friendly," she says."I said, 'The job looks great.You're a wonderful leader.I can't be here because I don't think this will be great.My spouse is a woman, and I have a daughter."Thinking about the dwindling percentage of female CEOs in the Fortune 500 , she says progress can't be truly made until the overall number of women leaders increases something that she sees as "a shared responsibility" for management teams and their talent development programs.On that path to the C-suite, she calls back to an important lesson, yet again from her mother: "Beth, if you want something, ask for it.""You expect you're going to be recognized because you've done the hard work, and that isn't actually how it always happens," Ford says.
Goldman Sachs slants research to help Democrats, top White House adviser says:::::New York (CNN Business) Kevin Hassett, one of President Donald Trump's top economic advisers, suggested that Goldman Sachs may be slanting its economic research to help Democrats ahead of the midterm elections.The Goldman Sachs economics team "almost at times looks like the Democratic opposition," Hassett told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Tuesday.The comment came after Harlow asked Hassett about a Goldman Sachs research report warning that a 25% US tariff on all imports from China could wipe out corporate profit growth in 2019.Hassett said he hadn't read the research, but went on to criticize Goldman's track record.Hassett claimed its analysis of last year's tax cuts was "really, really wrong and timed in a partisan way."He said Goldman's analysis predicted the tax cuts would be "really harmful" to the economy or have little impact before jacking up its forecast after they passed."So maybe they're just trying to make a partisan point before the elections," said Hassett, chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers.
China says it will never use its currency as a weapon in the trade war:::::The trade war between China and the United States is intensifying, but Beijing has just taken one potential weapon off the table.Premier Li Keqiang told an audience of global executives and policymakers that China would not weaken the yuan to boost trade with the rest of the world."China will never go down the path of stimulating exports by devaluing its currency," Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Wednesday.His comments came a day after the United States and China announced that they would impose their biggest rounds of tariffs yet on each other's exports, starting next week.That brings the value of goods hit by tariffs in the escalating conflict to more than $360 billion.President Donald Trump has threatened to hit another $267 billion of Chinese goods with tariffs.China, which buys far less from the United States than the other way round, is starting to run low on American products to target, raising speculation about what other measures it could take to hit back.Driving down the currency, which is also known as the renminbi, isn't one of them, according to Li."Persistent depreciation of the renminbi will only do more harm than good to our country," he said during a speech at a World Economic Forum event in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin.The yuan has dropped sharply against the dollar as the trade fight has ramped up, losing about 9% of its value since April.Accused of manipulation The decline has drawn the attention of President Trump, who has often accused China of devaluing the yuan to boost its huge export industry.Trump claimed in July that China was "manipulating" its currency lower.Li dismissed that idea on Wednesday."The recent fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate have been seen by some as an intentional measure on the part of China," he said."This is simply not true."The Chinese government plays a significant role in setting the value of the yuan and how it trades.Economists generally agree Beijing kept the currency artificially low in the past, but they are skeptical that government intervention has driven it down against the dollar and other major currencies this year.They say the escalating trade war with the United States and concerns over a slowdown in the Chinese economy have helped push the yuan lower at a time when the US Federal Reserve is steadily raising interest rates.That policy makes it more attractive for investors to hold assets in US dollars, prompting them to sell other currencies.Sudden drops in the yuan in 2015 and early 2016 set off turmoil in global markets as money poured out of China's economy.Beijing spent hundreds of billions of dollars propping it up.China will "work to create conditions for keeping the value of the yuan stable," Li said Wednesday.His words weren't enough to convince everyone, though."Manipulation has occurred and is occurring, and I hope that action is taken," Todd Rokita, a Trump-supporting congressman from Indiana, told CNN at the Tianjin conference just minutes after Li's speech.

CEOs are cashing in on the market boom:::::CEOs are using the market boom to quietly cash in their own chips.Insiders at US companies have dumped $5.7 billion of stock this month, the highest in any September over the past decade, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by TrimTabs Investment Research.It's not a new trend.Insiders, which include corporate officers and directors, sold shares in August at the fastest pace in 10 years as well, TrimTabs said.The selling is noteworthy because it occurred as the market rebounded sharply from an early 2018 tumble.Fueled by tax cuts and a strong economy, the Dow recently notched its first record high since January.Some corporate insiders have much of their net worth tied up in stock, so it could be that they are simply exercising caution.The bull market, already the longest history, can't last forever."It's a very prudent thing for them to unload some shares -- no matter how much they like the stock," said Joe Saluzzi, co-partner at brokerage firm Themis Trading."It doesn't necessarily mean they see something wrong."TrimTabs does not break down how many of the insider sales were pre-planned.The SEC allows executives to schedule stock sales ahead of time to avoid the appearance of insider trading.While the captains of Corporate America are cashing out, they are doing the exact opposite with shareholder money.US public companies have authorized a stunning $827.4 billion of stock buybacks in 2018 -- already a record for any year, according to TrimTabs.Apple (AAPL) alone announced plans last quarter for $100 billion of buybacks.The flurry of buybacks has been viewed by investors as a sign of confidence among CEOs."Insiders aren't announcing buybacks because they think stocks are cheap," said David Santschi, director of liquidity research at TrimTabs."What they're doing with shareholders' money and their own is quite different."Companies use buybacks as a way to return excess cash to shareholders.Share repurchases benefit investors -- and executives that are paid mostly in stock -- by providing persistent demand that tends to boost prices.Buybacks also artificially inflate earnings per share by eliminating the number of shares outstanding.Corporate America is enjoying record profitability thanks to the strong economy and a big reduction in what they owe Uncle Sam.The Republican tax law reduced the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and also gave companies a break on foreign profits that are returned to the United States.The tax windfall has also enabled companies to spend more on job-creating investments like new equipment and research projects.But buybacks are growing even faster.In fact, Goldman Sachs found that buybacks are garnering the largest share of cash spending by S&P 500 companies for the first time in a decade.Given the spike in buybacks, Saluzzi said it would be odd if insiders are rapidly dumping shares outside of preplanned transactions."You've got to raise your eyebrows and look at what's going on here," Saluzzi said.
GE is worth less than $100 billion for the first time since the Great Recession:::::General Electric, once America's most valuable company, is now in sharp decline.In a year full of dubious landmarks, GE has encountered another: The storied conglomerate is now worth less than $100 billion.That hasn't happened since March 2009 -- during the Great Recession.GE's (GE) stock crash -- down by nearly two-thirds since the end of 2016 -- has knocked the company down to the 59th most valuable in the S&P 500.It's a stunning reversal.GE was No.1 in the S&P 500 as recently as 2004, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.At the time, it was worth nearly $400 billion.Now GE is worth just a tenth of Apple (AAPL), the $1 trillion top dog of the market, and it's fallen behind Salesforce (CRM), PayPal (PYPL) and Nvidia (NVDA).GE's struggles got it kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average this summer.GE was an original member of the exclusive index in 1896 and had been in it continuously for 110 years.Plunging profits and mounting debt have driven GE's shares down by 35% this year.Only four S&P 500 companies have had a worse 2018.The most remarkable part about GE's decline is it comes at a time when the American economy and stock market are soaring.Rival industrial companies including Honeywell (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) are booming.But GE has been hobbled by years of poorly timed deals and needless complexity that have finally come home to roost.To pay off debt and jump-start the stock, GE is selling off countless businesses, including its century-old railroad division, Thomas Edison's light-bulb unit, Baker Hughes and the health-care unit that makes MRI machines.Selling in GE's stock has accelerated in recent days because of worries about GE Power, the most troubled part of the slumping conglomerate.GE confirmed last week that two of its gas turbines failed, forcing the closure of power plants.The turbine trouble could hurt the company's reputation and sales at a time when it's already strapped for cash.In a statement, GE said that it has "identified a fix" and has been working with customers to "quickly return units to service."JPMorgan Chase analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr, Wall Street's biggest GE bear, told clients the turbine failure "raises red flags" about GE Power.Others think that shareholders are overreacting.Most likely, GE's "fundamental technology is sound" and repair costs will be "manageable," Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin wrote to clients.
Minimum wage since 1938:::::In 1938, the minimum wage was $0.25.That's $4.19 in 2015 dollars.
Why investors aren't freaking out about inflation:::::Bond yields in the United States have been rising.But investors aren't freaking out.The Dow and S&P 500 both hit all-time highs last week -- and the Nasdaq is not far from a record, either.The 10-Year Treasury yield is still relatively low, but it has topped the psychologically important 3% threshold and is currently hovering around 3.1%.The concern is that this may be just the beginning.Longer-term rates could keep climbing given that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term rates Wednesday.At some point, investors may start to grow wary of what rising rates will mean for consumer spending and businesses looking to borrow more money.Higher rates, in theory, should lead to slower growth for both the economy and corporate earnings.The question is: how many more rate hikes are coming?Fed chair Jerome Powell may provide some clues at a press conference after the Fed decision is announced.Craig Birk, chief investment officer of Personal Capital, said that the market should be able to handle a few more quarter-point rate increases.But many investors may have gotten spoiled since rates were unusually low for so long.The federal funds rate is now in a range of 1.75% to 2% and there are expectations it could climb above 3% over the next year.Birk said many investors are hoping the Fed will end its rate hiking campaign in 2019 though."We finally have a real interest rate, not one that's just zero," Birk said."The Fed is still saying that they will likely raise rates slowly and steadily but the market seems to be betting they will stop sooner."Birk added the Fed had been run by so-called doves, people like former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen who preferred to keep rates low, for years.Investors are trying to adjust to the new mindset at the Fed."The market is still getting used to the idea that the Fed will be more balanced and more hawkish," Birk said.In other words, investors may be underestimating the willingness of the Fed to keep raising rates -- despite criticism from President Donald Trump about rate hikes and even if the data doesn't conclusively show inflation picking up in a meaningful way.Still, some experts think the Fed is likely to stick to its path of gradual rate increases.Powell, like his predecessors, is probably not interested in rattling the bond and stock markets with surprise moves."We do not see rising interest rates as a reason to sell stocks, particularly in the absence of runaway inflation," wrote John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial, in a report Tuesday.Inflation is still under control for now Wage growth is picking up, but that hasn't led to a big spike in consumer prices.So the Fed may still have some wiggle room to keep raising rates since the economy appears to be on solid footing."The market is interpreting higher rates as a response to better growth, not as a reason to fear a policy mistake, which we find encouraging," Lynch added.Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA, isn't overly worried about inflation getting out of control either."It's premature to say the Fed is behind the curve," said Keon."The question is what happens next year and 2020.There are some reasons to believe price pressures may continue to build.I don't think rates will get too high."Keon thinks the 10-Year Treasury yield could climb to a range of about 3.25% to 3.5%.That's still low enough to keep the economy humming along at a relatively solid clip, even if growth slows a bit.So the biggest change that might come from the Fed's rate hikes is a shift in the types of stocks that investors favor most.Tech stocks, retailers and other consumer companies, big winners of the past year, may start to lose some ground to financials.Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist with INTL FCStone, is bullish on regional bank stocks (KRE) and Bank of America (BAC), which has a big mortgage business.They should benefit from higher rates since it will make their lending operations more profitable.
Countries with higher wages than U.S.:::::
Corporate America, not banks, could cause the next recession:::::1.The next debt crisis: There's a $6.3 trillion elephant in the room.And it just might cause the next recession.The last downturn was triggered by Wall Street and Americans accumulating too much debt particularly in the sizzling housing market.A decade later, it's Corporate America borrowing with gusto.Egged on by extremely low rates, US companies have piled on a record-setting $6.3 trillion of debt, according to S&P Global Ratings.All that debt is easy to ignore right now.Default rates are minuscule.Companies are sitting on tons of cash, and their coffers are growing thanks to the soaring US economy and corporate tax cuts.But eventually, both the economy and corporate profits will slow, leaving companies less firepower to pay down debt.And it won't be as easy to roll over the debt that's due.Debt-laden companies would be vulnerable to rising borrowing costs caused by the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes.If companies are stuck in a credit crunch, they will have to pull back on hiring and investment.That could be a recipe for a recession."Corporates, not consumers or banks, will cause [the] next recession," Michael Hartnett, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist, wrote to clients on Thursday.Corporate America's debt binge has helped finance the recovery.Companies have borrowed to open factories, buy equipment and develop products.A chunk of that debt has also gone to reward Wall Street with massive stock buybacks.After a decade of low rates, companies have taken on more debt relative to the size of the economy than ever before.Total US business debt as a percentage of GDP is at a record high, according to David Ader of Informa Financial Intelligence.The riskiest category of borrowers has never been more leveraged.Companies with junk credit ratings are holding a record low $8 of debt for every $1 of cash, according to S&P.And then there are so-called zombie companies which can't even afford interest payments, despite the strong economy and low rates.Ben Breitholtz, data scientist at Bianco Research, found that 14% of the companies in the S&P 1500 don't have enough earnings before interest and taxes to cover interest expenses.That's above the world average of 10%.Those zombie companies are probably cringing as central bankers slowly end the easy-money days.The Fed is expected to lift rates on Wednesday, the eighth hike since late 2015.Four more moves before the end of 2019 may be in the cards.At the same time, the Fed is trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet an experiment that could contribute to higher borrowing costs as foreign central banks follow suit and unload bonds.Bank of America's Hartnett warned that an "aggressive" Fed in 2019 could trigger a "credit crunch" not just in emerging markets, but in Corporate America.2.Trade war: The US-China confrontation will escalate on Monday when the United States imposes tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.On the same day, China has pledged to retaliate with a tariff on $60 billion of American goods.The trade war is causing problems for Walmart, Procter & Gamble and a host of other companies that sell products imported from China or depend on Chinese goods in their supply chains.3.Nike earnings: What do Nike executives have to say about the response to their Colin Kaepernick ad campaign?We'll find out Tuesday, when the company reports earnings.Nike has had a good year: US sales are growing, and the stock is up 35%.4.Economy watch: The US government on Thursday will give the final reading on economic growth in the second quarter.The previous revision showed a strong growth rate of 4.2%.5.Coming this week: Monday US imposes tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods; MacOS Mojave launches Tuesday KB Home (KBH) and Nike (NKE) earnings; US consumer confidence Wednesday Bed Bath & Beyond and Carmax earnings; Federal Reserve interest rate decision; US new home sales for August Thursday Rite Aid, Carnival and Accenture earnings; final revision of US second-quarter GDP Friday End of Q3
Blind Brexit? Businesses fear even more uncertainty:::::Business is worried enough about Britain crashing out of the European Union.Now it has a new nightmare: a blind Brexit that could extend the uncertainty over trade for years.Fears are rising that the United Kingdom may leave the European Union in March 2019 with a deal so vague that it gives companies and investors no greater clarity on the future than they had in June 2016 when voters backed Brexit in a referendum.The political pressure increased Thursday when the only firm proposal for Brexit was panned by a key EU leader and French President Emmanuel Macron described people who said leaving the bloc would be easy as "liars.""The prospect of a vague Brexit, with only a slimline political declaration about the future EU-UK relationship published alongside a legally-binding withdrawal agreement, is gaining ground," said Mujtaba Rahman of the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.A blind Brexit may be even worse for some companies than a scenario where the United Kingdom leaves in March without an agreement on preferential access to Europe's vast markets.That would deliver a major shock but executives would at least know what they're dealing with.Stephen Phipson, CEO of the manufacturing trade group EEF, said further years of uncertainty would be most painful for large foreign manufacturers with complicated supply chains that crisscross borders.Investments on hold Global companies such as Airbus (EADSF), Siemens (SMAWF), BMW (BMWYY), and Nissan (NSANF) are in the firing line."An automotive manufacturer that has three plants here and one in Eastern Europe, he's going to put his investment over there," said Phipson."Boards won't release capital to invest because they're not sure of the environment."Many companies have put investments on hold following the vote for Brexit because they don't know whether they'll face new regulations, tariffs or customs checks at borders.It's also unclear if they'll be able to move staff between the European Union and the United Kingdom, or be forced to pay new taxes.BMW (BMWYY) said Tuesday that it would shut its Mini factory in England for one month of maintenance immediately after Brexit because it can't be sure of getting the parts it needs.Jaguar cited uncertainty over Brexit as one reason for putting 1,000 workers on a three-day work week until Christmas.Some executives have pinned their hopes on a proposal developed by British Prime Minister Theresa May that would maintain close trading ties in goods and agricultural products and include a transition period of nearly two years.But the European Union's top political leader Donald Tusk took a hard line on the plan known as Chequers after a meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg on Thursday, saying the proposal would not work because it risks undermining the bloc's single market in goods and services.'Very unappealing' May insisted that her plan is the only way forward.Still, she could be forced back to the drawing board by pressure from the European Union, her own party or the opposition.But even a blind Brexit would have opponents, including some that argue Britain would be giving up its negotiating ace: money it owes to the European Union."Hardliners will fight back by saying that the UK is throwing away its best card the 39 billion divorce payment to the EU for vague warm words about the future relationship and so would have little or no leverage during the talks on it during the transitional phase," said Rahman.Asked about a scenario where a blind Brexit was followed by Britain eventually crashing out the bloc without a final deal on trade, Phipson was unequivocal."That sounds very unappealing," he said.
What trade war? Dow hits record high:::::What trade war?The Dow just soared to its first record high since late January.The milestone shows that Wall Street is mostly unfazed by the escalating trade clash between the United States and China.The Dow's 251-point leap on Thursday marked its 100th record close since President Donald Trump's election, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.The S&P 500 also notched an all-time high.The Dow closed at 26,657.It has spiked about 3,300 points since a low on April 2, when investors were more worried about trade.They're betting that the strong US economy will power through the outbreak of tariffs."The market is showing incredible strength," said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group.Stocks spiked late last year and in January after Republicans enacted a sweeping corporate tax cut.The euphoria sent the Dow soaring from 25,000 to 26,000 in just seven trading days.Even market optimists were questioning whether stock valuations had gotten out of hand."In January, it felt like the market was bulletproof," said Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors."That's no longer the case."Eventually, that rally crumbled in dramatic fashion, punctuated by two single-day 1,000-point plunges.Wall Street was overcome by fears about inflation and spiking interest rates.It was the scariest moment for US investors in years."Sentiment had gotten really out of hand.The pullback was a reality check.The lack of a new high for so long has let the market play catchup to fundamentals," Hickey said.And the fundamentals look very good.Corporate earnings have gone through the roof, thanks to strong economic growth and the corporate tax cut.The unemployment rate has dropped to just 3.9%.And US economic growth has climbed to an annualized pace of 4.2%."What matters most to investors is corporate profits," Suzuki said."The profit trends are healthy and accelerating.That's tremendously bullish for US stocks."
China strikes back by going after America's energy companies:::::This story was originally published September 19, 2018.New York (CNN Business) The United States has an abundance of natural gas that pollution-riddled China badly needs to wean itself off coal.Eying China's voracious demand, Cheniere Energy, ExxonMobil (XOM) and other American energy companies are racing to build more than two dozen expensive facilities to export liquefied natural gas, which is super-cooled natural gas that can be transported by ship.China even marked President Donald Trump's visit to Beijing last fall by agreeing to invest as much as $43 billion into an LNG project in Alaska.But this pairing of an able buyer and well-supplied seller no longer looks like a slam dunk.As part of the escalating trade war, China on Tuesday said it will impose a 10% tariff on $60 billion of US products -- including LNG.The trade tensions could make it more difficult for the next wave of LNG export facilities to get the financing needed to get off the ground.Read More
Investors are starting to worry about the economy:::::Wall Street doesn't seem to care about the escalating trade war between the United States and China.The Dow jumped 175 points and the Nasdaq climbed 1% on Tuesday despite Washington and Beijing pushing ahead with another round of punishing tariffs.Investors are betting the US economy will continue to power ahead of the rest of the world.Yet beneath the surface, some are getting worried about the ability of the global economy to withstand the trade war and brewing storms in emerging markets.One in four professional investors is bracing for global growth to slow over the next year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey published on Tuesday.That's the worst outlook in this monthly survey since December 2011 and up from August when just 7% of investors were pessimists.And nearly half of investors surveyed by Bank of America believe the US economy will decelerate and rejoin the rest of the world.Just one in three said that in August."Investors are holding on to more cash, telling us they are bearish growth," Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote to clients.Not surprisingly, the trade war topped the worry list for the fourth straight month.The second-most popular "tail risk" is related: a slowdown in China's economy.The survey was conducted September 7-September 13, before President Donald Trump leveled a 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of imports from China AND Beijing said it will retaliate by putting tariffs on $60 billion worth of US imports at a rate of 5% to 10%."It certainly does seem that we're approaching spiral stage," Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote to clients on Tuesday.Anne Van Praagh, a managing director at Moody's, said that higher tariffs will "hurt the economy by distorting prices," creating inefficiencies and having a chilling effect on investment decisions.'Black Swan' gauge on the rise Wall Street seemed to take the news in stride: the Dow climbed within 400 points of an all-time high, the first since January.The VIX (VIX) volatility index, a measure of market turbulence, declined 7% to a very quiet level of 13.Recall that the so-called "fear gauge" shot up to 50 in February.However, a lesser known barometer of investor worry is sending more ominous signals.The CBOE SKEW Index rises when option trades signal that concern about a "black swan" incident -- an unexpected event that has a huge impact.The index is trading near the highest level since records began in 1990.US markets have been bolstered by a strong domestic economy that can hopefully shrug off the trade tensions.The US unemployment rate is sitting at just 3.9%.America's gross domestic product climbed at an annualized pace of 4.2% in the second quarter.Despite the trade standoff, growth is on track to accelerate to 4.4% in the third quarter, according to a volatile forecasting model from the Atlanta Federal Reserve.'It's going to be a mess' The impact from proposed tariffs on GDP growth in the United States is likely to be "very modest," Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote to clients on Tuesday.Hatzius said that while there is a chance that Washington and Beijing reach a resolution, "further escalation seems likely" and the situation is "highly uncertain."Still, some prominent business leaders are starting to sound the alarm.The Business Roundtable, a powerful lobby led by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) boss Jamie Dimon, issued a statement saying that "unilaterally imposing tariffs is the wrong way to achieve real reforms" and threatens "further harm to US businesses and workers."FedEx (FDX) CEO Fred Smith told analysts on Monday that the US-China trade fight is "worrisome to everyone" and may already be causing China's economy to moderate.Alibaba (BABA) founder Jack Ma warned the US-China trade war could last for 20 years."It's going to last long, it's going to be a mess," Ma said on Tuesday.
Executives on the front line worry about where the trade war goes next:::::Companies in the front line of the trade war between the United States and China are anxious about what comes next.Executives at a World Economic Forum event in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin have been digesting the dramatic escalation in the conflict this week.Some appear relaxed, some worried, while others are hoping for the best.The Trump administration launched its biggest barrage of tariffs against China early Tuesday.Within hours, Beijing said it would retaliate with more tariffs of its own."This round of tariffs is going to cause even more damage for US companies," said William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.The head of Coca-Cola (KO) in China, Curtis Ferguson, isn't fretting yet about the impact on his business.His supply chain is local, and he doesn't expect Chinese consumers to stop buying Coke in the way they boycotted South Korean goods during a political spat between Beijing and Seoul last year."If that was a card for China, I think they would have played that one," he said.The vast majority of Coca-Cola's 50,000 strong workforce in the country are Chinese, and targeting the company could put jobs at risk, he added.But Ferguson is also concerned about what may be around the corner."Business doesn't like uncertainty.We're for free trade," Ferguson told CNN on the sidelines of the meeting in Tianjin."I don't know how bad things will get."While it's running out of US imports to target with new tariffs, China could find other ways to make life difficult for global brands.US companies operating in China have already reported increased hurdles, including delays at customs and more inspections by regulators, according to a recent survey by two American chambers of commerce based in the country.'Aggressive US sanctions' Some businesses, such as Japanese drinks group Suntory, (STBFY) are already feeling the financial pinch.CEO Takeshi Niinami said the trade war was an "immediate threat" to the company's bottom line."We have huge investments in the United States where we produce bourbon that's exported to other countries," he said during a panel discussion on Wednesday.The company now faces tariffs on its exports from the United States into China and the European Union."The whole global supply chain is getting hurt by aggressive US sanctions," Niinami added.Others are looking anxiously at what the dispute may mean for plans to enter the Chinese market, even if there's little they can do to avoid being caught in the crossfire.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) wants to take advantage of Beijing's efforts to open up its financial industry and recently applied to launch a brokerage in the country.Beyond 'our control' Asked if he was worried Beijing could withhold approval for the venture because of the trade war, JPMorgan China CEO Mark Leung said that it's "not within our control."The bank is "working constructively" with regulators, and still hoped to get a license soon, he added.Trade experts expect China to dig in for a war of attrition with the United States.A resolution could be a long way off."Eventually there will be a negotiated solution," said Wendy Cutler, vice president of think tank the Asia Society Policy Institute.That could involve China toning down parts of its industrial policy, which the US administration says facilitates the theft of intellectual property."It's going to require both sides to show flexibility," Cutler added.Coca-Cola's Ferguson suggested a more novel way to fix the relationship."Trump seems to have figured out Twitter (TWTR), but I think he needs to get WeChat and get talking with President Xi," he said, referring to Tencent's (TCEHY) popular Chinese social networking app.
What they're saying about the trade war at China's 'Davos':::::Business leaders and officials in China say that Beijing is ready to dig in for a war of attrition with the United States on trade.The Trump administration launched its biggest barrage of tariffs yet just as top executives and policymakers were gathering for the start of a World Economic Forum event in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin on Tuesday.China said later it would retaliate with more tariffs of its own.The trade war dominated discussions at the "summer Davos," as the event is known, and few participants predicted a swift resolution to the conflict."China is growing concerned that the US motivation is now trying to keep China down and contain it," said Timothy Stratford, a managing partner at law firm Covington & Burling in Beijing."I expect that we're going to have a deadlock for some time."The US government wants China to change practices that it says disadvantage American businesses, accusing Beijing of overseeing the theft of US intellectual property and boosting Chinese companies through aggressive industrial policies.The Chinese government dismisses the criticism as groundless, even though American and European firms operating in China frequently complain about the issues.'This is a test for us' Chinese government officials speaking in Tianjin insisted that the country can weather the tariff battle even though it has shaken the country's financial markets."The trade frictions don't have a huge direct impact on China's economy, but they may impact people's expectations," said Liu Shijin, a Chinese government adviser and member of the monetary policy committee at the People's Bank of China.A slump in Chinese stocks and the yuan showed investors had "overreacted" to trade fears, he added."This is a test for us and we should stick to our direction and never stop," Liu said of the trade war.Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of China's securities regulator, said that the new US tariffs wouldn't make Beijing back down.He said he hoped the two governments would soon talk again and strike a deal.One of China's most prominent entrepreneurs is doubtful that will happen anytime soon.The trade war is "going to last long, it's going to be a mess," Jack Ma, the founder and executive chairman of top Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba (BABA), said Tuesday at a separate event in the eastern city of Hangzhou.He predicted the conflict could drag on for as long as 20 years.US companies operating in China say the waves of tariffs are already hurting their business.Casualties also include American chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM), whose $44 billion deal to buy Dutch rival NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) was blocked by Chinese regulators in July.Other companies could get caught in the crossfire.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) wants to take advantage of China's efforts to open up its financial industry and recently applied to launch a brokerage in the country.Asked if he was worried Beijing could withhold approval for the venture because of the trade war, JPMorgan China CEO Mark Leung said in Tianjin that it's "not within our control."He added that the bank is "working constructively" with regulators.US economy could overheat While China appears to be suffering more pain right now, it may not be in the US government's interests to leave tariffs in place for too long."We've seen a heating up of the US economy," said Helen Zhu, head of China equities at investment manager Blackrock."If tariffs were to go to 25% later this year on $200 billion of imports, that would work into inflationary pressure and damage the US consumer.""There's an increasing incentive for both sides to work out something in the coming months," she said.If they don't, the fallout will be felt around the world."Every time we get into a trade war, it doesn't end up well," said Carlos Moedas, the European Union's commissioner for research, science and innovation."Each time we've done protectionism, people get worse off," he added, referring to the global trade slump in the 1930s."Economically, politicians seem not to have learned their lessons."-- Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.
Corporate America is spending more on buybacks than anything else:::::For the first time in a decade, Corporate America is steering more money into stock buybacks than investing in the future.S&P 500 companies rewarded shareholders with $384 billion worth of buybacks during the first half of 2018, according to a Goldman Sachs report published Friday.That big bonanza for Wall Street is up 48% from last year and reflects spiking profitability thanks to corporate tax cuts and the strong US economy.But that doesn't mean companies aren't spending on job-creating investments, like new equipment, research projects and factories.Business spending is up 19% it's just that buybacks are growing much faster.In fact, Goldman Sachs said that buybacks are garnering the largest share of cash spending by S&P 500 firms.It's a milestone because capital spending had represented the single largest use of cash by corporations in 19 of the past 20 years.And the trend may not be done yet.Goldman Sachs predicted that share buyback authorizations among all US companies in all of 2018 will surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever.Apple (AAPL) alone spent a whopping $45 billion on buybacks during the first half of 2018, triple what it did during the same time period last year, the firm said.That included a record-shattering sum during the first quarter.Amgen (AMGN), Cisco (CSCO), AbbVie (ABBV) and Oracle (ORCL) have also showered investors with big boosts to their buyback programs.'Blackout' poses risk Buybacks are typically cheered by shareholders, at least in the short term.One reason is that buybacks artificially inflate earnings per share by eliminating the number of shares outstanding.Moreover, companies stepping into the market with giant purchase orders provide persistent demand, lifting share prices.The impact of buybacks is so profound that some worry about how stocks will hold up without them.Companies generally aren't allowed to buy back stock during so-called "blackout" periods that begin the month before reporting earnings.David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, warned that the upcoming blackout period poses a "near-term risk" to the market.He noted that market volatility tends to be higher during buyback blackouts.Business spending on the rise The good news is that large companies are investing a sizable chunk of their winnings from the corporate tax overhaul.The Republican tax law, enacted in late 2017, slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.It also gave companies a tax break on foreign profits that are returned to the United States.Capital spending is on track for the fastest growth in at least 25 years, Goldman Sachs estimates."Rumors of the demise of capital spending have been greatly exaggerated," Kostin wrote.The growth of business spending, much like buybacks, has been dominated by some of the biggest companies in the United States.Goldman Sachs estimates that 79% of the growth in S&P 500 capital spending came from 10 companies alone.For example, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) alarmed investors in April by disclosing more than $7 billion of capital expenditures in the first quarter.Facebook (FB), under fire for its handling of the 2016 election, is spending heavily on people and technology.Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC) and Micron (MU) are also accelerating their capital spending.Even though CEOs continue to green light vast buybacks, they have been quietly taking a different approach with their own money.Corporate insiders sold $10.3 billion of shares in August, the most since November 2017, according to research firm TrimTabs.
Lehman Brothers: When the financial crisis spun out of control:::::New York (CNN Business) Legendary investment bank Lehman Brothers was on fire and no one was coming to put it out.Bank of America refused to rescue the 158-year-old Wall Street firm without support from Uncle Sam.The British government wouldn't let Barclays ( BCS ) buy Lehman Brothers and its toxic balance sheet.And Washington decided against another politically unpopular bailout.So Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail.At 1:45 a.m. on Monday, September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.What ensued was the largest and most complex bankruptcy in American history.But that doesn't do justice to the damage Lehman's demise caused the financial system.The implosion of Lehman Brothers and the mayhem it unleashed was the most terrifying moment for business and the US economy since the Great Depression."It was the moment when the financial crisis fully burst upon us, when panic seized the markets," Phil Angelides, who led the official bipartisan inquiry into the 2008 meltdown, told CNN.Lehman's failure shook Wall Street to its core.The Dow plummeted 504 points , the equivalent of 1,300 points today.Some $700 billion vanished from retirement plans and other investment funds.The panic that followed plunged the American economy into a severe downturn , now known as the Great Recession.Today, Lehman Brothers and its CEO Dick Fuld are the poster children for the reckless risk-taking that wrecked the economy.Frantic talks Lehman's final days were marked by frantic last-minute negotiations over its fate.Right up until the end, everyone thought someone would rescue Lehman Brothers: Surely the firm wouldn't be allowed to fail.Bear Stearns, a smaller investment bank, had been saved just six months earlier by Washington and JPMorgan Chase.On Wednesday, September 10, South Korea's Korean Development Bank dropped out of the running to be Lehman Brothers' white knight.The news combined with Lehman's announcement of a record $3.9 billion quarterly loss sent the bank's shares cratering 45%.With South Korea out, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson called Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis to ask him to find a creative way to buy Lehman Brothers.Put on your "imagination hat," Paulson urged Lewis.But by Friday, September 12, Bank of America said it was bowing out unless the government was willing to help.Lehman was simply stuck with too many "illiquid" mortgage assets, and it couldn't sell them quickly enough to meet other obligations.Bank of America decided instead to buy the next investment bank in line to fail: Merrill Lynch."You just didn't know what was going to happen when you got into work on Monday," said Brady Kim, who worked as an analyst on Lehman's trading desk."Were you going to be working for Barclays?Some Korean conglomerate?"The one option few saw coming was bankruptcy."They're not just going to let the bank go under," Kim said.'Not a penny' That Friday evening, Paulson ordered the heads of the big Wall Street firms to meet at the New York Fed's headquarters.They were told to come up with a private-sector solution to save Lehman.American officials had little appetite for another bailout.They had just seized control of teetering mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the weekend before.Fed officials said Paulson made it clear there would be no government help this time, "not a penny."I never thought the company would go out of business."James Chico, former Lehman Brothers analyst Saturday brought an apparent breakthrough for Lehman: Barclays agreed to buy Lehman as long as Wall Street would take some assets off its hands.But the Barclays deal went up in smoke on Sunday when UK regulators balked at blessing the risky deal."Imagine if I said yes to a British bank buying a very large American bank which ... collapsed the following week," Alistair Darling, the UK's chancellor of the exchequer, later told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.'It was pandemonium up there' With no buyers left, regulators pressured Lehman Brothers to file for bankruptcy on Sunday night, before trading opened in the morning.Lehman's lawyers and executives left the New York Fed to inform the board that no rescue was coming."We went back to the headquarters, and it was pandemonium up there," Harvey Miller, the bankruptcy counselor for Lehman Brothers, later told investigators.The Fed rejected a last-minute Lehman plea for additional assistance from the central bank, leading to the early-morning bankruptcy.The collapse shocked employees."I never thought the company would go out of business.It was terrible," said James Chico, who worked as an analyst in the back office at Lehman for more than two decades.Tom Rogers was on his honeymoon in St. Lucia when the bank, his employer for seven years, went bust."I came back, and it was just mass chaos," said Rogers, who started as an intern at Lehman and moved up to senior analyst in the firm's reinsurance business.'Cataclysmic proportions' The turmoil showed just how fragile and interconnected the entire system was.The situation was exacerbated by the near-collapse of AIG, the insurance behemoth.Regulators feared AIG's demise would bring down the whole system so AIG was given a $182 billion bailout.Fear and panic quickly spread through the financial system, causing credit markets to freeze.Even large and iconic industrial companies such as General Motors were unable to receive short-term funding."The financial crisis reached cataclysmic proportions with the collapse of Lehman Brothers," the crisis inquiry commission concluded.Fuld, who had infamously told shareholders in April 2008 that "the worst is behind us," emerged as one of the villains of the crisis.He steered Lehman right into the face of an epic storm.Between 2000 and 2007, Lehman's assets had more than tripled to $691 billion.And its borrowing ratio, known as leverage, jumped to 40 times its shareholders' equity in the company.The firm had relatively little capital to protect against trouble.Madelyn Antoncic, Lehman's chief risk officer from 2004 to 2007, tried and failed to warn Fuld against taking on more mortgage risk."At the senior level, they were trying to push so hard that the wheels started to come off," Antoncic told the commission.For his part, Fuld told lawmakers in 2008 that the pain of Lehman's failure "will stay with me for the rest of my life."The former Lehman Brothers boss, who made and lost a $1 billion fortune on Wall Street, has made few public appearances since the crisis.He did speak at a 2015 event where he admitted he would do some things differently."I missed the violence of the market and how it spread from one asset class to the next," Fuld said.Richard Fuld, former chairman and chief executive officer of Lehman Brothers, speaks during a hearing in 2010.Where were the regulators?Fuld doesn't deserve all the blame.The firm's demise underscored the wild risk-taking that regulators and CEOs had allowed to become rampant across Wall Street.Consider, for example, the 2000 deregulation of exotic financial instruments known as derivatives.Regulators had little window into how these trades linked banks to one another.When one bank failed, other financial institutions fell in a kind of domino effect.Even a month before Lehman's bankruptcy, officials at the Fed were still seeking information on the bank's 900,000 derivative contracts.And they were clueless about the risk posed by AIG's enormous book of derivatives."The people charged with overseeing our financial system were flying blind as the crisis developed," Angelides said.Only in 2010, with the passage of the sweeping Dodd-Frank financial reform law, were derivatives required to be bought and sold on exchanges.Regulators also failed to get Lehman Brothers to slow its headfirst dive into mortgages.The firm kept buying real estate assets well into the first quarter of 2008.The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision didn't issue a report warning of Lehman's "outsized bet" on commercial real estate until two months before its collapse.The OTS was abolished by Dodd-Frank."Our regulatory system is made of humans and humans make mistakes."James Angel, Georgetown University business professor Likewise, the SEC declined to call Lehman Brothers out for exceeding risk limits even though the agency was aware."The SEC...knew of the firm's disregard of risk management," the commission said.Lehman Brothers also got away with using accounting gimmicks to mask how much money it borrowed.Bart McDade, Lehman's president and chief operating officer, wrote in an email at the time that the accounting maneuvers are "another drug we R on."Should Lehman have been saved?Economists will debate for decades whether Washington should have rescued Lehman to prevent the chaos that followed.Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke maintains that regulators had no authority to lend to a failing Lehman."We essentially had no choice and had to let it fail," Bernanke told the commission.But others say Bernanke and Paulson should have realized that allowing Lehman to fail would deepen the crisis."Our regulatory system is made of humans and humans make mistakes," said James Angel, a business professor at Georgetown University."The Fed clearly could have done a better job of containing the damage."The inconsistent response by Washington deciding not to rescue Lehman after saving Bear and before helping AIG "added to uncertainty and panic," the financial crisis inquiry concluded.Could it happen again?Today's financial system is safer thanks to the reforms put in place after 2008.Banks have bulked up on vast amounts of capital.Regulators are more vigilant.But some worry about the risk of another downturn , even if it doesn't start with banks."I'm concerned about now," said famed Yale professor Robert Schiller, pointing to "highly priced" stocks and rising home values."We're already in for what could be a repeat of 2008," Shiller said."It will look different this time, but there could be a decline in home prices and recession coming in."A Decade Later: It's been 10 years since the financial crisis rocked America's economy.In a special yearlong series, CNN will examine the causes of the crisis, how the country is still feeling its effects, and the lessons we have and have not learned.
These countries are most vulnerable to the emerging market storm:::::1.Trouble in paradise: For the past decade, a river of easy money rushed into emerging markets.Now that powerful force is reversing.Rising interest rates, along with trade wars, have started a stampede out of some emerging markets.The Turkish lira and Argentine peso have crashed, while China's stock market is stuck in a bear market.Problems long masked by extremely low interest rates are now coming into sharp focus."The tide ... is receding and some countries have been, or will be, caught naked," Jason Daw, head of emerging markets strategy at Societe Generale, wrote to clients last week.Developing economies may not get relief anytime soon.The Federal Reserve is expected to keep steadily lifting interest rates off the floor.The rate hikes represent a vote of confidence in the strong American economy, which continues to prop up US stocks.However, the end of easy money along with a surge of trade tensions is causing serious headaches in other parts of the world.Higher rates strengthen the US dollar, making it more difficult for countries like Turkey that took out a ton of dollar-denominated debt.Moreover, the rate hikes have lured money that had flocked to far-flung places back to the United States.But not all emerging markets are feeling the pain equally.Some, like South Korea and Thailand, seem to be weathering the storm relatively well.That's a huge flip from two decades ago, when an Asian financial crisis began with the implosion of the Thai baht.Others, like Turkey, have gotten crushed.The Turkish central bank had to resort to a surprisingly strong interest rate hike last week to stem the bleeding in the lira.Argentina's central bank hiked interest rates to 60%.The central bank of Russia, which has been hammered by sanctions from Washington, surprised investors on Friday with the first interest rate hike since 2014.South Africa's central bank, which meets on Thursday, could be forced to do the same.Daw said that countries most susceptible to the emerging market stress have several things in common.First, they've piled on lots of dollar-denominated debt -- much of which is due soon.Second, they have relatively high overall levels of debt and low rainy-day funds.And these emerging markets are running trade and budget deficits.So which countries fit these categories?Daw called out Turkey, South Africa, Malaysia, India and Indonesia as the most vulnerable."The misallocation of capital following a decade of cheap money is starting to be exposed," Daw said.2.More earnings: It's a slower week for earnings, but some notable companies will post results, including Oracle, FedEx, General Mills, AutoZone and Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants.The booming economy and lower tax rates have boosted corporate profits.3.New Apple products: Apple's new iPhone models hit store shelves on Friday.The company is also releasing iOS 12, Apple Watch and software updates to its HomePod and tvOS devices.Apple's (AAPL) stock is up 32% this year.4.S&P reclassification: The S&P 500 is undergoing some changes on Friday.A number of major tech and telecommunications stocks will move to the communication services unit, including Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL).5.Coming this week: Monday Oracle (ORCL) and FedEx (FDX) earnings; iOS 12 launches Tuesday General Mills (GIS) and AutoZone (AZO) earnings; US Treasury foreign bond ownership stats Thursday Darden (DRI) Restaurants and Micron Technology (MU) earnings Friday S&P reclassification; new iPhones and Apple Watch hit stores

Barnes & Noble stock soars 20% as it explores a sale:::::This story originally published on October 3, 2018.New York (CNN Business) Barnes & Noble stock jumped more than 20% after the board said it would consider a sale of the troubled company.The board said Wednesday it had appointed a special committee to review offers.One came from longtime Barnes & Noble chairman Len Riggio.He is the company's largest shareholder, controlling close to 20%.Barnes & Noble ( BKS ) also disclosed that a shareholder it could not identify had rapidly built up a stake in the company.To block a hostile takeover, Barnes & Noble's board of directors approved what's known as a poison pill.The poison pill will kick in if the unidentified party accumulates 20% of the stock or more.At that point, shareholders will be allowed to buy Barnes & Noble's stock at a 50% discount, diluting the value of the shares.The announcement comes shortly after another investor disclosed a stake of close to 7%, and said he had held talks with Riggio about buying the company.Read More
Toys 'R' Us brand may be brought back to life:::::New York (CNN Buiness) Toys "R" Us may be coming back.The company closed all of its US stores in June as part of a bankruptcy liquidation.But the owners of the company's remaining assets are looking into restarting the business, as well as the related Babies "R" Us brand, the company disclosed in a court filing this week.Toys "R" Us had planned to auction off the rights to its name and the Babies "R" Us brand.Bidders had already made offers for them, according to the filing.But the company's owners decided to cancel the auction.The company said it is considering "a new, operating Toys 'R' Us and Babies 'R' Us branding company," the filing said.The plan would "create new, domestic, retail operating businesses under the Toys "R" Us and Babies "R" Us names, as well as expand its international presence and further develop its private brands business."The details of when and how the brand would be brought back to life were not disclosed.Read More
Honda teams up with GM on self-driving cars:::::New York (CNN Business) Honda and General Motors are teaming up to create a new generation of fully autonomous vehicles.Honda will invest $2 billion over 12 years into GM's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, Cruise.GM and Cruise have been building and developing self-driving versions of GM's Chevrolet Bolt EV electric car with plans to deploy a fleet of them for public use next year.With Honda's engineering and financial assistance, Cruise will begin developing a new vehicle that is not based on any existing car, the companies said.It will represent the next step in autonomous driving, one in which controls for human operation are entirely absent."This is a purpose-built vehicle that will be the first vehicle produced at scale that is freed from the constraints of vehicle design and having a driver at the wheel," said GM president Donald Amman.Amman gave no precise timing on when Cruise Automation's self-driving vehicles will be shuttling members of the general public, either in the Bolt EV or the new car.The cars will be deployed only when it has been decided they are safe enough, Amman enough.The Japanese tech-focused investment bank Softbank recently invested $2.25 billion in Cruise , and Honda took a $750 million equity stake.Together, the Honda and Softbank investments give Cruise a total value of $14.6 billion.Read More
Aston Martin falls 5% in London IPO:::::Aston Martin is joining the ranks of listed automakers with an IPO that values the British company at more than $5 billion.But its first day of trading in London got off to a rocky start.The favorite carmaker of fictional British secret service agent James Bond priced its shares at 19.00 ($24.70), giving it a valuation of 4.3 billion ($5.6 billion).The final listing price is 16% below the top of the range that Aston Martin had targeted, reflecting investor doubts about whether the carmaker should be valued in the same league as Italian rival Ferrari.Shares dipped nearly 5% in London trading.In going public, the British company is asking investors to overcome fears about US threats to tax foreign autos and the potential for Britain's planned exit from the European Union to disrupt supply chains and markets.Aston Martin, which has a history of bankruptcy filings, is now producing healthy profits.It sold more than 5,000 cars in 2017, its best performance in nine years.That generated record revenue of 876 million ($1.1 billion), an increase of nearly 50% over the previous year.Earnings for the first half of this year show that momentum has continued.Revenue was up 8% over the same period a year earlier, while profit increased 14%, according to the numbers that were published last month.Aston Martin has in recent years sought to capitalize on its high-end brand.But analysts at Bernstein see several potential problems.They argue the Aston Martin brand is not as strong as that of Ferrari (RACE), which is bolstered by decades of racing history and a slew of Formula 1 championships.The British automaker also has much tighter margins than its Italian rival and a worrying history of uneven sales.With money raised from the IPO earmarked for existing shareholders rather than investment in the company, Aston Martin executives could be pinning too much hope on the success of a planned SUV."Given its current financials and apparently rather less robust demand, it's a big stretch for us to see how it can possibly match Ferrari's profitability," analysts at Bernstein wrote recently."We can't see it getting anywhere close."Aston Martin's owners include Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler (DDAIF), private equity firm Investindustrial and investors based in Kuwait.
JCPenney names Jill Soltau as its new CEO:::::This story originally published on October 2, 2018.New York (CNN Business) Jill Soltau, a veteran retail leader most recently in charge of Joann fabric and craft stores, will be tasked with turning around JCPenney.The company announced on Tuesday that Soltau will take over as its chief executive beginning on October 15.JCPenney has been leaderless since Marvin Ellison left in May to take the top job at Lowe's.Soltau, 51, will be the 25th woman currently leading a Fortune 500 company, according to Fortune magazine.She will become Penney's fifth chief executive in the past decade.She will make a base salary of $1.4 million, with a $6 million signing bonus and will be eligible for annual performance-based bonuses.In a sign that Soltau has Wall Street's approval to start, shares rose 10% in extended trading.Read More
Tesla calms fears with strong sales numbers:::::New York (CNN Business) A tumultuous quarter at Tesla ended with some very good sales numbers.The company delivered 83,500 vehicles during the third quarter, a strong performance that should calm investor fears about logistical problems and a looming cash crunch.That included almost 56,000 of the lower-priced Model 3.Production was a bit below that number: Tesla said it built about 53,000 Model 3s.But that was within the company's projections.Only three months ago, the company struggled to build 5,000 Model 3s in a week, a long-delayed target.Tesla did not maintain that pace, but production was still high enough to keep the company on track to turn a sustained profit for the first time.Tesla was sorely in need of good news.
S&P downgrades debt-riddled GE and GE Capital:::::New York (CNN Business) New General Electric boss Larry Culp just got a fresh reminder of the debt-riddled balance sheet he's inheriting.Barely 24 hours after Culp became CEO , S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit ratings of GE ( GE ) and GE Capital.Moody's and Fitch warned they could do the same.All three ratings firms cited GE's elevated leverage and shrinking cash flows -- an alarming trend exacerbated by serious problems at GE's power division.GE said on Monday that plunging profit at GE Power will cause the parent company to miss targets in 2018.S&P pointed to "deep near-term challenges" at GE Power, which has been hurt by the shift towards renewable energy.More recently, GE disclosed mechanical problems with its gas turbines.Culp surely has a long to-do list as he starts work as the first outsider CEO in GE's history .But at the top of the list must be repairing GE's once-sturdy balance sheet.GE had a perfect AAA credit rating as recently as 2009.S&P lowered it on Tuesday from "A" to "BBB+".Underscoring the scale of the problem, Moody's said that GE's "very elevated leverage" could lead it to downgrade the company's rating by multiple notches.Ratings downgrades can make it more expensive for companies to borrow money.The good news is that S&P updated its outlook on GE to "stable" because the firm expects leverage and cash flow will improve in the coming years.But GE's finances have deteriorated further.S&P listed the dividend as one of several levers Culp could pull to reduce debt.In a statement, GE said it has a "sound liquidity position" that includes cash and operating credit lines.Repeating comments made by Culp on Monday, GE said it remains "committed to strengthening the balance sheet including deleveraging."Now that he's in charge, Culp will need to decide if he wants to go forward with former CEO John Flannery's plans to break-up GE.Flannery's turnaround plan included exiting various businesses, including oil and gas, health care and the century-old railroad division.Proceeds from the sales would then be used towards paying down debt.
Amazon announces $15 minimum wage for all US employees:::::New York (CNN Business) Amazon is raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all US employees.The change takes effect November 1 and applies to full-time, part-time and temporary workers.Amazon ( AMZN ) says the $15 minimum wage will benefit more than 250,000 Amazon employees, plus 100,000 seasonal workers."We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead," said Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO."We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us."The change applies to Whole Foods and all other subsidiary employees.Amazon also said its public policy team will begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009."We'll leave it to Congress and professionals to decide what the right number is," Dave Clark, the company's senior vice president of worldwide operations, told CNN's Christine Romans."But for us, that number is $15."The size and explosive growth of Amazon give the decision importance far beyond the hundreds of thousands of people who will benefit directly.Amazon is among the largest employers in the United States, and it has added more American jobs in the past decade than any other company.The decision also raises the stakes for potential workers at Amazon's next headquarters.The company is planning to create a second headquarters, known as HQ2, with as many as 50,000 jobs.Amazon has named 20 cities as finalists , including Atlanta, Chicago and Washington, D.C. "I want to give credit where credit is due," Sanders said on Tuesday."I want to congratulate Mr. Bezos for doing exactly the right thing."He said he looked forward to working with Bezos to push for a $15 federal minimum.Bezos responded by thanking the senator."We're excited about this, and also hope others will join in," he wrote in a tweet.Thank you @SenSanders.We're excited about this, and also hope others will join in.https://t.co/kasWkkOhWo Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) October 2, 2018 Workers across the country have pushed for a $15 minimum wage, most notably as part of the movement known as Fight for $15.Supporters say it's a remedy for widening wage inequality and will boost consumer spending, while opponents counter that it could reduce opportunities for employment, particularly for teenagers and others looking for entry level or low-skilled jobs.Some companies have responded to the public pressure.Target raised its minimum wage for new hires to $12 an hour in September and plans to raise its minimum to $15 by the end of 2020.Disney reached a deal with its unions to pay a minimum of $15 an hour at Disneyland in California in 2019 and at Disney World in Florida by 2021.And Walmart, the country's largest private-sector employer, which has more than 1 million US workers, raised its minimum wage to $11 in February.Clark said that Amazon wanted to make its change sooner."We decided, why wait?We should really do this now," he told Romans.Paul Sonn, state policy program director for the National Employment Law Project, said Amazon's announcement would put pressure on other companies to raise pay, and on Congress to lift the national minimum.Twenty-nine states have their own minimum wages higher than the federal $7.25.Neil Saunders, managing director of the consultancy GlobalData Retail, said that higher minimum pay could also help Amazon recruit workers."Without a rise in wages, Amazon would be placing itself at a disadvantage in the labor market," Saunders said.The company's rapid growth requires "a lot of recruitment which is becoming increasingly difficult in a tight labor market," he said."This is especially so over the holiday season."Saunders added that the decision was "politically savvy."Last month, Amazon said that the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in its fulfillment centers was already more than $15 per hour.Amazon median pay last year was $28,446, according to a company filing.That comes to $13.68 an hour.The company noted that the figure includes international and part-time employees.The company also announced that it is increasing the minimum wage for UK employees starting November 1.The new minimum wage is 10.50 ($13.60) for the London area and 9.50 ($12.30) for the rest of the country.More than 37,000 employees, including seasonal workers, will be affected by the change.The current UK minimum wage for adults over 25 is 7.83 ($10.15).
Volkswagen dumps jailed Audi CEO amid emissions probe:::::London (CNN) Volkswagen has severed ties with suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who has been jailed since June in connection with an emissions investigation.Stadler has left the board of management of Audi parent company Volkswagen ( VLKAF ) and stepped down as chairman of the premium brand's management board, the autos group said in a statement Tuesday."Due to his ongoing pretrial detention, he is unable to fulfill his duties as a member of the board of management and wishes to concentrate on his defense," the statement said of Stadler.Munich prosecutors said in June that Stadler, who has worked for Volkswagen since 1990, had been detained because of concerns he could influence witnesses in an ongoing investigation He is the highest ranking Volkswagen executive to be arrested in connection to a costly diesel emissions scandal that burst into public view in 2015.Volkswagen previously said that Stadler would be considered innocent until proven guilty.Audi tapped its top sales executive to lead the company after Stadler was detained.The German carmaker has admitted that it rigged millions of diesel engines to cheat on emissions tests.Diesel cars from Volkswagen and its Audi subsidiary cheated on clean air rules with software that made emissions look less toxic than they actually were.The scandal sent its share price plunging, and trashed confidence among consumer and regulators in diesel technology.The episode has already cost Volkswagen more than $30 billion in recalls, legal penalties and settlements.In a separate announcement on Tuesday, Volkswagen said it would offer incentives to customers in Germany who wanted to swap older diesel cars for cleaner models.Martin Winterkorn, the former chief executive officer of Volkswagen, was indicted by US prosecutors in May .He was charged with wire fraud, and conspiracy to defraud American customers and violate the Clean Air Act.Matthias Mueller, who was brought in to replace Winterkorn, stepped down earlier this year and was replaced by BMW ( BMWYY ) veteran Herbert Diess.Diess acknowledged at a press conference in April that Volkswagen had "lost a great deal of trust," and that it would take years to restore public confidence in the automaker.
Goldman Sachs slants research to help Democrats, top White House adviser says:::::New York (CNN Business) Kevin Hassett, one of President Donald Trump's top economic advisers, suggested that Goldman Sachs may be slanting its economic research to help Democrats ahead of the midterm elections.The Goldman Sachs economics team "almost at times looks like the Democratic opposition," Hassett told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Tuesday.The comment came after Harlow asked Hassett about a Goldman Sachs research report warning that a 25% US tariff on all imports from China could wipe out corporate profit growth in 2019.Hassett said he hadn't read the research, but went on to criticize Goldman's track record.Hassett claimed its analysis of last year's tax cuts was "really, really wrong and timed in a partisan way."He said Goldman's analysis predicted the tax cuts would be "really harmful" to the economy or have little impact before jacking up its forecast after they passed."So maybe they're just trying to make a partisan point before the elections," said Hassett, chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers.
Tencent Music plans to public on US exchange:::::This story originally published on October 2, 2018.New York (CNN Business) Tencent Music has filed plans to go public in the United States in what could be one of the biggest recent US IPOs by a Chinese company.That amount would mark the third largest Chinese IPO to list in the United States since the beginning of 2018, according to data provider Dealogic.The Netflix-like video platform iQIYI raised $2.3 billion and social shopping app Pinduoduo raised $1.6 billion.Tencent Music dominates the music streaming market in China through its Spotify-like apps.The company revealed in its SEC filing that its music apps have more than 800 million monthly active users.Spotify owns a 9% stake in Tencent Music The entertainment subsidiary of Tencent reported a profit of $263 million for the first six months of 2018, with revenue of $1.3 billion.Read More
Meet GE's new boss: Can Larry Culp right the ship?:::::New York (CNN Business) General Electric is turning to an outsider to clean up a mess that took decades to create.Larry Culp, 55, is a proven leader known for his hands-on approach.He received a hero's welcome from Wall Street on Monday after suddenly being installed as GE's new boss.GE's ( GE ) beaten-down share price spiked 10%.Culp, who became CEO of industrial manufacturer Danaher at just 37, faces a monumental task in restoring GE to greatness .The iconic maker of light bulbs, MRI machines and jet engines is bleeding badly from poorly timed deals , needless complexity in its corporate structure and mounting debt.Nearly half a trillion dollars has evaporated from GE's market value over the past 18 years.That's roughly the size of Facebook ( FB ).GE, a company that prides itself on management excellence, is so desperate that for the first time in its 126-year history it is being led by an outsider."GE has been like watching a slow (but fatal) train wreck," Scott Davis, lead analyst at Melius Research, wrote to clients on Monday."Unwinding 15 years of bad decisions will require courage," but Davis added: "I wouldn't want to bet against Larry."Culp brings credibility By bringing in fresh blood, GE is betting that it will be able to accelerate a turnaround plan started under John Flannery, a 30-year veteran of the company who was unceremoniously ousted as CEO to make room for Culp."GE should be commended for selecting a credible, seasoned GE outsider," Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote to clients.Culp is likely to "more candidly and quickly identify how bad things may be."Culp built an impressive track record while leading Danaher between 2001 and 2015.The company's revenue and market cap quintupled over that time.It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited."Jeff Sonnenfeld, Yale School of Management professor The Harvard Business School graduate is credited with remaking Danaher from a tired manufacturer into a modern company with strong health sciences and technology businesses.He pushed Danaher into health care, a business that today sells tools, lights and software used by dentists."He's got the chops to take over a company of this size," said Jim Corridore, an analyst who covers GE at CFRA Research.'Disturbing' writedown Khanna cheered Culp's history of "prudent" capital allocation at Danaher, noting that roughly $25 billion was deployed during his tenure.After years of bad decisions that caused a buildup of debt, GE sorely needs a strong steward of its depleted resources.Analysts say that under former CEO Jeff Immelt GE far too often bought high and sold low.Consider the disastrous 2015 purchase of Alstom, a $9.5 billion acquisition that pushed GE Power further into fossil fuels at precisely the wrong time.GE Power is in such disarray today that the company announced it will need to take an accounting write down of up to $23 billion to reflect the deterioration of businesses acquired."The size of the writedown is disturbing," said Corridore.Flannery took over a company in disarray when he became CEO last year.While he deserves credited for disclosing "dirty laundry" he uncovered, Flannery failed to move fast enough to restore confidence among shareholders."It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited," said Jeff Sonnenfeld, an authority on corporate governance at the Yale School of Management.In a statement, Immelt predicted that GE Power will recover under the new leadership team because of its superior technology and talent."Larry Culp will be a strong leader for GE and its board of directors.His expertise and experience are aligned perfectly with GE's needs," Immelt said.Will GE continue its makeover?Now, Culp must decide whether to press forward with Flannery's turnaround plan.Culp joined GE's board in April, meaning he signed off on Flannery's push to remake the company around power, its booming aviation business and renewable energy.The makeover would require GE to get rid of its health care, railroad, light bulb and oil-and-gas businesses -- and use the proceeds to pay down debt.Given Culp's history in health care at Danaher, Sonnenfeld predicted that GE could decide to keep its own health care division.GE's vast corporate structure, built up over decades by Immelt and Welch, could get slimmed-down under Culp.Culp ran Danaher with less than 100 employees in the corporate office, and Davis said the new CEO will likely likely "strip corporate back to necessary functions and tear down all the fiefdoms."Tall challenge ahead But cost-cutting alone won't fix GE.Culp needs to quickly get to the bottom of the trouble at GE Power.Not only is the business facing a serious challenge from renewable energy, but blade failures that have emerged recently point to potential quality problems.GE also faces a large pension shortfall caused by years of inattention and low interest rates.And then there's the ghost of GE Capital, the financial arm that nearly killed GE a decade ago during the financial crisis.Culp will be charged with safely shrinking GE Capital while navigating landmines, such as WMC Mortgage, the defunct subprime mortgage business that is being investigated by the Justice Department.Elsewhere at GE Capital, Culp needs to stabilize the long-term care insurance portfolio that suffered a $6 billion loss in January.The news prompted an SEC investigation -- the second GE is currently facing.By hiring Culp, GE may have quickly improved its serious credibility problem on Wall Street.But don't be fooled: righting the ship will take much longer.

Stocks pop after new US-Canada-Mexico deal:::::New York (CNN Business) The stock market appears to like the new trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.Stocks popped after all three countries agreed to an 11th hour deal to replace NAFTA.The Dow rose 193 points, a gain of 0.7%.The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, and the Nasdaq lost 0.1%.The United States also agreed to make concessions on some automobile tariffs for cars and trucks built in Canada and Mexico as part of the agreement, which replaces NAFTA and will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).Shares in major automakers rose on the news.GM gained 1.6%, and Ford climbed 0.8%.Fiat Chrysler rose 2.7%.Still, some market experts said investors may be overreacting to the USMCA deal.That's because the United States still faces another major trade battle."While the U.S. has reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, growing trade conflict between China and the U.S. threatens economic growth in both countries," said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorgan Funds, in a report Monday.Eric Winograd, senior economist with AB, also thinks that China-US tension will not be resolved this easily."The US relationship with China is much more complicated than its relationship with Canada.And of course the stakes are considerably higher when dealing with Chinathe Chinese have leverage over the US that Canada simply doesn't have," Winograd wrote, referring to China's ownership of US Treasury debt as well as the fact that it's a much bigger market for US exports."I certainly wouldn't rule out an agreement being reached with China, but I don't think that the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement provides a template that can be used in discussions with the Chinese," Winograd added."The US relationship with China is much more complicated than its relationship with Canada.And of course the stakes are considerably higher when dealing with China."Eric Winograd, senior economist with AB Others think that a US-China deal is inevitable, which makes the market's reaction to the USMCA agreement, a logical one."Many investors are betting there's room for a market friendly compromise after the US midterm elections in early November when the Chinese will have an incentive to deal to avoid the 25% tariff rate that kicks in on $200 billion in Chinese exports on January 1, 2019," wrote Alec Young, managing director of global markets research for FTSE Russell, in a report.Other market movers It's not just the trade deal helping move the markets.The surprise ouster of General Electric CEO John Flannery and a deal between Tesla and the SEC are also having a big effect.Shares of GE jumped 7% following the news that Flannery, who had only been CEO since August 2017, is being replaced by Larry Culp, a former head of industrial conglomerate Danaher.Culp, who joined GE's board in April, faces a difficult task in getting GE back on track.GE also announced Monday that it was taking a charge tied to its struggling GE Power unit.The stock had fallen 35% so far this year prior to Monday's surge.Tesla also rallied Monday after the electric car maker reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will require Elon Musk to step down as chairman but allow him to stay on as CEO.Shares of Tesla climbed 17%.The stock plunged 14% Friday on the news that the SEC had filed a lawsuit accusing Musk of making "false and misleading statements" earlier this summer when he tweeted that he had "funding secured" for a deal to take Tesla private.
Goldman Sachs' new CEO has a lot of work to do:::::New York (CNN Business) It's a new era at Goldman Sachs.David Solomon, the part-time electronic dance DJ who previously served as president of the company and co-head of its investment banking division, took the reins from Lloyd Blankfein on Monday as CEO.Blankfein, who had served as CEO since 2006 and will stay on as chairman through the end of the year, is already thinking about his next chapter , which could include more "unrestrained tweeting."He started weighing in on issues including climate change and immigration toward the end of his tenure."I might venture forward on opinions that are my own opinions, without any regard for whether they serve the constituencies and the interests of Goldman Sachs," Blankfein said in a sit-down with Solomon posted Monday to social media.His successor has plenty to do.The bank's stock is down more than 11% this year .It has underperformed peers, weighed down by an inconsistent trading division that doesn't mint money the way it used to.Recruitment and retention of top talent remains vital, as does the development of newer lines of business, such as Marcus, Goldman's nascent retail banking venture.Here's what tops Solomon's to-do list.Trading division troubles Solomon's first order of business is to turn around Goldman's trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies."The trading business is really what has hurt them in the past couple of years," said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.The unit made up more than half the bank's revenue in 2012, but shrank to just over a third last year, as a calm market and low interest rates pushed investors toward lower-fee index funds and passive funds.Goldman's trading side showed resilience last quarter, but not because of stocks.Revenue from bond, currency and commodities trading surged 45% from a year ago, while revenue from equities stayed stagnant.Solomon is willing to make changes.Last month, he installed Marty Chavez , the outgoing CFO, as co-lead of the struggling division.At a conference hosted by Sanford C. Bernstein in May, Solomon said that Goldman wasn't sitting around "waiting for the environment to change," and that the firm will keep investing in technology for trading.Diversity and talent Solomon is making his presence felt with other leadership changes.Stephen Scherr, who had been in charge of the consumer bank, is stepping into the CFO role.John Waldron, a longtime deputy of Solomon's, will take over as president and chief operating officer."The question is: How does his new team jell together?"said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research.Another challenge for Solomon will be attracting and keeping talent at the firm.Many young professionals have favored Silicon Valley over Wall Street in recent years, as tech companies entice college graduates with competitive pay and relaxed work environments.Goldman has loosened up, with results to show for it.Roughly two-thirds of employees are Millennials, while more than 25% are engineers.Still, the company must ramp up diversity efforts that started under Blankfein, Lip said.Solomon has signaled this is a priority.This summer, more women were added to the 33-person management committee.Goldman also said it had formed a committee to promote the careers of diverse business leaders at the company.Changing course As trading becomes a less reliable source of income, and many competitors scale up, Solomon's Goldman is expected to explore new ways to grow its business."The supermarket finance business model is what's working well today, and Goldman is a lot [narrower]," Biggar said.Some of this work is underway.Last year, Goldman released a plan to boost revenue by $5 billion by 2020, in part by bulking up other parts of the company.And the firm has doubled down on its consumer arm, Marcus.Goldman, which launched Marcus in the United States in 2016, started to offer savings accounts in the UK last week.The bank may expand into life insurance, mortgages, auto loans and wealth management services down the road."We have the ambition to build a large, differentiated, highly profitable digital consumer finance platform," Solomon said in May.Solomon has been at the bank since 1999.He's expected to be a leader in Blankfein's mold, though his extracurricular interests certainly set him apart."This is not somebody they're bringing in from the outside that will radically alter the makeup of the company," Biggar said."I don't think anyone's expecting that.But there are things on the edges he could do."
California has a new law: No more all-male boards:::::New York (CNN Business) Companies headquartered in California can no longer have all-male boards.That's according to a new law, enacted Sunday, which requires publicly traded firms in the state to place at least one woman on their board of directors by the end of 2019 or face a penalty.It also requires companies with five directors to add two women by the end of 2021, and companies with six or more directors to add at least three more women by the end of the same year.It's the first such law on the books in the United States, though similar measures are common in European countries.The measure was passed by California's state legislature last month .And it was signed into law by Gov.Jerry Brown on Sunday, along with a trove of other bills that look to "protect and support women, children and working families," the governor's office said in a release
Instagram gets a new chief: Facebook vet Adam Mosseri:::::New York (CNN Business) Instagram has a new leader.On Monday, the company announced that Adam Mosseri will head Instagram effective immediately.Last week, Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced they would leave the company."We are thrilled to hand over the reins to a product leader with a strong design background and a focus on craft and simplicity as well as a deep understanding of the importance of community," Systrom and Krieger said in a statement.Mosseri -- who joined Facebook, which owns Instagram, in 2008 -- has held various roles at the company, including head of News Feed and design director for Facebook's mobile apps.Most recently, he was Instagram's VP of product.In his new role, Mosseri will oversee "all functions of the business" and will hire a new executive team, including a head of engineering, product and operations.Mike Krieger, Adam Mosseri and Kevin Systrom.Before their departures, Systrom was CEO and Krieger was the chief technology officer.Read More
Ryanair's strikes are hitting its profits and stock price:::::London (CNN Business) Ryanair could be headed for a rough landing this year.Europe's leading low cost airline slashed its profit forecast for the current fiscal year to between 1.1 billion ($1.27 billion) and 1.2 billion ($1.39 billion).That's about 150 million ($174 million) less than the company had expected.Ryanair ( RYAAY ) said that strikes and flight cancellations in September had resulted in lower traffic and higher costs.It warned that customer fears of further cancellations had led to reduced bookings, forcing the airline to cut fares in the third quarter.Shares in Ryanair dropped over 10% in London, leaving the stock down more than 22% so far this year.The company said it could slash its profit guidance further if the strikes continue.A sharp rise in fuel costs has also heaped pressure on the airline and its outspoken CEO Michael O'Leary , who is confronting labor unions after staff strikes forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights in recent months.Read More
Bristol-Myers says shareholders vote to approve Celgene takeover:::::FILE PHOTO: Logo of global biopharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb is pictured at the headquarters in Le Passage, near Agen, France March 29, 2018.REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Cos shareholders voted to approve the drugmakers $74 billion takeover of biotech Celgene Corp on Friday despite a campaign by activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP to scuttle the deal.The company said investors holding 75.7 percent of its shares had voted in favor of the deal in a preliminary count.Celgene said separately in a statement that its shareholders representing more than 70 percent of its shares outstanding who were entitled to vote, voted in favor of the transaction.It also said it expects the deal to close in the third quarter.Bristol-Myers announced in early January that it planned to buy Celgene in a cash and stock transaction to bring together companies that specialize in oncology and cardiovascular drugs in what would be the largest pharmaceutical industry merger ever.But Starboard and the companys second largest shareholder, Wellington Management, opposed the deal.Starboard abandoned a campaign against the deal after proxy advisory firms recommended investors support it.Bristol-Myers said during a shareholders meeting that it does not expect changes to its dividend policy after the acquisition.
JPMorgan's solid quarterly profit beats back recession fears:::::(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results.FILE PHOTO: People walk inside JP Morgan headquarters in New York, October 25, 2013.REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz/File Photo GLOBAL BUSINESS WEEK AHEAD The largest U.S. bank by assets showed strength across its businesses in the first quarter, driven by what Chief Executive Jamie Dimon described as solid growth in the U.S. economy, moderate inflation and strong consumer and business confidence.U.S. bank stocks have underperformed the broader market in recent months on fears of an impending recession, with economists and investors citing concerns over a flattening yield curve and slowing housing market.But bank executives have downplayed concerns, pointing to continuing loan growth.There is no law that says it has to stop, Dimon said when asked if the decade-long economic expansion is not due to turn into a recession.I wouldnt count on there having to be a recession in the short run.Loans in JPMorgans consumer banking division rose 4 percent from a year ago.Overall revenue rose 4.7 percent to $29.85 billion.Analysts had expected revenue of $28.44 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Weve been generally quite optimistic about the outlook for the economy, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told reporters on a call to discuss the results.It doesnt diminish the fact that there are a number of risks out there.Right now we dont see that playing out in the data.The banks net interest margin, a key measure of loan profitability, edged up only 0.02 percent point from the fourth quarter, a slower pace of improvement than in the two previous quarters.Investors have been concerned that net interest margins may have peaked for the banks, since the Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise short-term rates this year and the spread between short- and longer-term rates has narrowed.While Lake did not directly answer if the lending spread had peaked after fueling profit growth for years, she said it will likely not get any better in the coming quarters.The bank expects it to remain constant, she said.She also reiterated the banks 17 percent projection for return on average tangible common equity and said she does not anticipate the bank will raise it this year.Lake downplayed questions about whether the banks $90 million provision for credit losses in its commercial banking segment in the first quarter was a reason for concern.These downgrades were idiosyncratic.It was a handful of names of diverse commercial and industrial borrowers, she said.We are not seeing signs of deterioration.In the banks capital markets business, equity underwriting fell 13 percent and bond trading revenues fell 8 percent from the year-ago quarter.Bank executives had signaled earlier in the quarter that capital markets revenue could fall by a greater amount.Shares of the bank were up 3.6 percent in midmorning trading.JPMorgan was the first of the big banks to report first-quarter earnings, and investors watched closely for cues on the health of the U.S. economy and the financial system.The bank said net income rose to a record $9.18 billion, or $2.65 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $8.71 billion, or $2.37 per share, a year earlier.Net interest income rose 8 percent to $14.60 billion, boosted by interest rate increases since the first quarter of last year.Analysts had estimated earnings of $2.35 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
Mexico, U.S. to discuss NAFTA replacement, border delays:::::MERIDA, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican government and business leaders meet with their U.S. counterparts for a second straight day on Friday, seeking to hasten ratification of a trade deal, resolve border delays that are hurting exporters, and discuss metals tariffs.FILE PHOTO: Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador speaks with Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard and Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez during a meeting with industry bosses and members of his cabinet to discuss the new administration's policy on the minimum wage at National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico, December 17, 2018.REUTERS/Edgard Garrido/File Photo The talks coincide with renewed tensions over trade and the border after two years of uncertainty sparked by President Donald Trumps demand to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Mexican Economy Minister Graciela Marquez are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the so-called U.S.-Mexico CEO Dialogue in the Mexican city of Merida in the Yucatan peninsula.Their meeting will center on ratification of the deal agreed to replace NAFTA, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), as well as a dispute over tomato trade and the steel and aluminum tariffs the Trump administration imposed on Mexico nearly a year ago under the Section 232, Marquez told Reuters.Marquez will be able to tout a workers rights bill that Mexicos lower house of Congress approved late on Thursday, legislation that U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called key to winning over Democrats wary of USMCA.Officials will also discuss delays at the U.S.-Mexico border which have cost businesses on both sides millions of dollars.Slowdowns began late last month after Trump threatened to close the border if Mexico did not halt a surge of people, mostly Central Americans, seeking asylum in the United States.In the end, his administration reassigned several hundred border agents to handle the influx of migrants, creating staffing shortages that triggered long delays.The big announcement of a border closure didnt happen, but instead we are left in a worse situation ... because there is a de facto closure that is causing huge delays, said Economy Minister Marquez.Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said at his regular morning news conference in anticipation of the talks in Merida, And I expect if theres a problem with the time its taking for goods to be transported and pass customs, that things will gradually return to normal.U.S. Customs and Border Protection will send about 100 agents to the border to speed up crossing times, a Democratic U.S. Representative said on Thursday.Marquez said the issue of fabricated structured steel would also be discussed after the U.S. International Trade Commission said last month that domestic producers were being harmed by imports of the product from Canada, China and Mexico.In prepared remarks, Ross underscored Mexicos position as the second-largest U.S. export market and its third-largest trading partner, saying the integrated economies generated over $678 billion in two-way trade in goods and services last year.Ross said the forums job was to explore how the private sector can create economic conditions to improve the lives of people in southern Mexico and Central America.Mexico is eager to drum up investor interest in strategic projects in its southeastern states and allay any fears about how Lopez Obrador has been managing the Mexican economy, Latin Americas second largest, since taking office in December.Lopez Obrador is scheduled to give closing remarks at the event later in the day.

Merck KGaA clinches $6.5 billion Versum takeover in bet on electrochemicals:::::FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germanys Merck KGaA sealed a $6.5 billion takeover deal with Versum Materials after overturning a deal it had agreed with rival bidder Entegris.FILE PHOTO: A logo of drugs and chemicals group Merck KGaA is pictured in Darmstadt, Germany January 28, 2016.REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski/File Photo A bet on a recovery in electronic materials markets for semiconductor makers, the transaction will boost the share of profit that diversified Merck derives from high-tech chemicals to 27 percent from 19 percent previously.Merck, also maker of pharmaceuticals and biotech production gear, this week won the backing of Versums board for its $53-per-share offer, lifted from $48 previously, having been spurned for weeks.The business combination is expected to significantly strengthen Mercks Performance Materials business sector, creating a leading electronic materials player focused on the semiconductor and display industries, it said in a statement.Mercks swoop comes amid depressed stock prices in the volatile semiconductor industry after demand for mobile devices slowed and prices for memory chips sank.But Merck said here on Friday it would capitalize on global data processing and storage demand mushrooming by more than 30 percent per year until 2025, fueled by trends such as artificial intelligence and autonomous driving.Versum is the former specialty chemicals division of industrial gases group Air Products.Merck, whose shares were down 2.5 percent at 1400 GMT is targeting 75 million euros ($85 million) in annual synergies by the third full year after closing of the deal, which it expects in the second half of 2019, it said in a statement on Friday.The deal will increase earnings per share in the third full year after closing, while the increase will be immediate when adjusted for one-off items, it added.The purchase will be financed with existing cash as well as a $4 billion bridge loan and a $2.3 billion term loan provided by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas Fortis and Deutsche Bank.Merck aims to preserve a strong investment grade credit rating, it said.Guggenheim and Goldman Sachs are financial advisors, and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP is acting as legal counsel to Merck.Lazard and Citi are serving as financial advisors to Versum, with and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP as legal counsel.Entegris this week stepped back from the contest, saying it would not improve the terms of the all-share merger signed in January, which would have seen Versum investors receive about $44 worth of Entegris stock for each Versum share.Versum had to pay Entegris a $140 million termination fee.

Japan court extends Carlos Ghosn's detention until April 22:::::TOKYO (Reuters) - The Tokyo District Court said on Friday it had extended Carlos Ghosns detention period by eight days, giving prosecutors until April 22 to bring formal charges against the former Nissan Motor Co boss or let him go.FILE PHOTO - A video statement made by the former Nissan Motor chairman Carlos Ghosn is shown on a screen during a news conference by his lawyers at Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo, Japan April 9, 2019.REUTERS/Issei Kato Ghosn was arrested for the fourth time last week on suspicion that he had tried to enrich himself at Nissans expense, to the tune of $5 million.He is also awaiting trial on other charges of financial misconduct and aggravated breach of trust.Ghosn, who had been released on $9 million bail in early March after spending 108 days in jail, has denied all allegations against him.Ghosns initial detention period was set to expire on Sunday, and had been widely expected to be extended by the maximum 10 days.Public broadcaster NHK said it was rare for prosecutors full extension request to be denied and shortened.Ghosns defense team has launched a public and fierce battle against Tokyo prosecutors, calling the latest arrest illegal in documents seen by Reuters.Later on Friday, a court rejected the defense teams appeal against the extension, meaning that the team may have to make a fresh bail application if Ghosn is indicted on further charges at the end of his new detention.Once celebrated as a savior of a near-bankrupt Nissan 20 years ago, Ghosn has been ousted as chairman of Nissan, Renault SA and Mitsubishi Motors Corp since his arrest, jeopardizing the auto-making alliance he masterminded.The court decision came as several dozen executives and board members from the three automakers gathered in Paris for an alliance anniversary dinner described by one participant as simple, nothing ostentatious.New Renault Chairman Jean-Dominique Senard told managers they had proved their ability to overcome our differences and keep the alliance strong, also invoking a need for quality improvements and swift joint decision-making, sources said.Senard and the three carmaker CEOs also met on Friday for a monthly alliance board meeting, followed by a presentation to the larger group of Renault vehicles in development.
Oil rises as supply constraints outweigh China slowdown fears:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday as involuntary supply cuts from Venezuela and Iran plus conflict in Libya supported perceptions of a tightening market, already underpinned by a production reduction deal from OPEC and its allies.FILE PHOTO: The sun sets behind an oil pump outside Saint-Fiacre, near Paris, France March 28, 2019.REUTERS/Christian Hartmann Brent crude oil futures were at $71.47 a barrel at 1332 GMT, up 64 cents or 0.90 percent and heading for their third weekly gain in a row.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $64.20, up 62 cents or about 1 percent.For the momentum to continue next week, WTI needs to close today above $64 a barrel and preferably break the resistance of $65 a barrel.Volume has been very strong throughout the week, Petromatrixs Olivier Jakob said.Oil markets have been lifted by more than a third this year by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, U.S. sanctions on oil exporters Iran and Venezuela, plus escalating conflict in fellow OPEC member Libya.The head of Libyas National Oil Corporation warned on Friday that renewed fighting could wipe out crude production in the country.We see Brent and WTI prices averaging $75 per barrel and $67 per barrel respectively through the rest of this year, but risk is asymmetrically skewed to the upside, RBC Capital Markets said in a note.Geopolitically infused rallies could shoot prices toward or even past the $80 per barrel mark for intermittent periods this summer.OPEC and its allies meet in June to decide whether to continue withholding supply.Though OPECs de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, is considered keen to keep cutting, sources within the group said it could raise output from July if disruptions continue elsewhere.On the demand side, most of the worlds growth in fuel consumption is coming from Asia, where Chinas economic growth is expected to slow to its lowest in nearly 30 years at 6.2 percent this year, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.However, concern over such a slowdown was muted on Friday.While macro fears of an economic hard landing may be overblown, the concentration risk of global oil demand (in Asia) remains underappreciated, RBC Capital Markets said.For a graphic on China GDP growth, see - tmsnrt.rs/2VCLIa8
Chevron to buy Anadarko for $33 billion in shale, LNG push:::::(Reuters) - Chevron Corp on Friday said it will buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp for $33 billion in cash and stock as the company doubles down on its bet on U.S. shale oil and gas production, where the surge in output has made the United States the worlds largest energy producer.With oil prices surging this year, Chevron and larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp have been increasing investment in the Permian basin in West Texas, the most prolific shale oil field in the country.Their efforts coincide with a pullback by the smaller companies that revolutionized the industry through shale drilling, who have had to curtail spending due to investor dissatisfaction with weak returns.The deal is the oil industrys largest since Royal Dutch Shell bought BG Group in 2016, and it sparked speculation that other shale producers are in play.Shares of Apache Corp, which also has extensive acreage in the Permian Basin, jumped 7 percent in premarket trading, while Pioneer Natural Resources Co rose 6 percent.U.S. crude oil production now surpasses 12 million barrels a day (bpd), and the nation is the third-largest producer of liquefied natural gas (LNG), the super-cooled fuel that is seeing record demand as a cheaper, cleaner alternative for countries that still rely heavily on coal for power generation.Chevron, which already has 2.3 million acres in the Permian Basin, said the deal to buy Anadarko would give the combined company a 75-mile (120-km)-wide corridor across the Permians Delaware basin, on the Texas-New Mexico border.Anadarko also has a Mozambique LNG project, part of one of the industrys largest planned current investments.At the end of 2018, Exxon and Chevron accounted for about one-fifth of Permian output, where producers pump around 4 million barrels per day (bpd) currently.IHS Markit expects it to hit 5.4 million bpd in 2023, more than the total production of any OPEC country other than Saudi Arabia.It will be a continuous shift toward larger companies in basically all segments of the shale industry, said Artem Abramov, head of shale research for Rystad Energy.Chevron shares fell 4 percent as investors weighed the cost of the deal, which includes taking on $15 billion of Anadarkos debt.Shares of Anadarko surged 33 percent, reflecting the 39 percent premium offered by Chevron compared to Thursdays closing market price.The $65 per share offer was structured as 75 percent stock and 25 percent cash.Occidental Petroleum Corp bid more than $70 per share for Anadarko and is now considering options, CNBC reported on Friday.MAJORS CLAIMING SHALE Chevron, Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc largely missed out on the first phase of the shale bonanza while more nimble independent producers such as Anadarko pioneered shale drilling technology and leased Permian acreage on the cheap.That has changed in recent years due to aggressive land purchases and expansion.Before this deal, Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP held about 4.5 million acres in the Permian Basin, according to Drillinginfo.Oil majors have also been on the M&A sidelines in recent years, but as they have ramped up shale drilling, there was expectation that majors would have to seek out acquisitions to help counter the oft-sharp declines experienced by shale wells.Chevron now joins the ranks of the UltraMajors and the big three becomes the big four, said Roy Martin, senior analyst at WoodMackenzie.The deal makes Chevron the second-largest producing major, up from the fourth, Martin said.The acquisition makes the Majors peer group much more polarized.ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell and BP are now in a league of their own.Last month, Chevron said it expects shale production from the basin to reach 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) by the end of next year.The company said the deal would add to its free cash flow and profit one year after closing, if Brent crude, currently around $70, holds above $60 per barrel.Chevron also said it plans to raise annual share buybacks to $5 billion from $4 billion when the deal closes and to sell $15 billion to $20 billion of assets between 2020 and 2022.The enterprise value of deal is $50 billion..Under the terms of the agreement, Anadarko shareholders will receive 0.3869 shares of Chevron and $16.25 in cash for each Anadarko share.Chevron Chief Executive Michael Wirth will lead the combined company after the deal closes.Chevron will remain headquartered in San Ramon, California.FILE PHOTO: A Chevron gas station sign is pictured at one of their retain gas stations in Cardiff, California October 9, 2013.REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is Chevrons financial adviser, while Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is its legal adviser.Evercore and Goldman Sachs are financial advisers to Anadarko, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP are its legal advisers.

Fiat Chrysler CEO sees acceleration as year goes on:::::AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler gave an upbeat forecast for 2019 after a tricky end to last year and a slow start to this one, confirming the carmaker was on track to meet its targets and easing fears of a slowdown on the North American market.FILE PHOTO: John Elkann, Chairman of the Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Group attends the presentation of the Science Gateway, a new facility dedicated to scientific education and outreach, by architet Renzo Piano at the CERN in Meyrin near Geneva, Switzerland, April 8, 2019.REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo Speaking at a time when deal talk is bubbling again in the industry, Chairman John Elkann told investors the Italo-American group was ready to play a part in the new and exciting era for the auto industry.He also struck a positive tone on the short-term outlook.Despite the (fact that the) second part of 2018 included trade difficulties in some areas that persisted in the first part of this year, we forecast a significative improvement in the second half of 2019, Elkann said.Chief Executive Michael Manley, who took up his post last July, said the groups operating performance this year would exceed the record results posted in 2018.In February weaker-than-expected guidance for 2019 profits and industrial free cash flow raised doubts about longer-term targets.Manley has sought to persuade investors that the 2020 goals set by late boss Sergio Marchionne were still achievable.I am confident that we will successfully deliver on our guidance for this year, he said.He added that he expected a continued strong performance in North America, the carmakers main profit engine which accounts of almost 80 percent of core earnings, with higher margins compared to last year.Weaker margins in North America in the last quarter of 2018 had raised concerns about a potential slowing demand in the United States, where FCA also faces stiff competition in the vital SUV and truck segments.BOLD AND CREATIVE Manley said industrial free cash flow this year was expected to be more than 1.5 billion euros, down on last year due to higher capital expenditure.Manley also said he aimed to make dividends at FCA a regular feature after the group paid 0.65 euros a share to investors on 2018 results, its first dividend in 10 years.At 1330 GMT Fiat Chrysler shares were up 2.4 percent, giving it a valuation of more than 21.5 billion euros ($24.3 billion).Elkann - a scion of Italys Agnelli family that is Fiat Chryslers biggest shareholder - reiterated the family was prepared to take bold and creative decisions to help build a solid and attractive future.Recent media reports have said Frances Renault could be eyeing a bid for Fiat while in March the president of Peugeot family holding company FFP said he would support a new deal and suggested Fiat Chrysler was among the options.After the sudden death of Marchionne last year, speculation about the future of Fiat Chrysler has intensified.Marchionne, who had created the group by merging a troubled Fiat with Chrysler of the U.S., had advocated industry mergers to share the cost of building electric and self-driving cars.Carmakers around the world are looking to tie-ups to cope with rising competition, the rise of electrification and the threat of a trade war between the United States and China.
Wells Fargo's cost cuts fuel profit rise, but deposits fall:::::(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co reported a 16.4 percent jump in quarterly profit on Friday, as the lender reaped the benefits of aggressive cost cutting.FILE PHOTO: A Wells Fargo ATM machine is shown in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 19, 2018.REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo Noninterest expenses fell 7.5 percent to $13.9 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, from a year earlier, and the company said it was on track to meet its 2019 expense target of $52 billion to $53 billion.Lower costs helped the banks profits even as total deposits fell, suggesting that the lender was struggling to bounce back from its problems related to a sales scandal that began more than two years ago.The scandal has already cost the bank billions of dollars in fines and customer remediation, tarnished its reputation, attracted heightened regulatory oversight and led to the exit of two chief executives.Interim Chief Executive Officer Allen Parker said his priority included exceeding the expectations of our regulators.We have more work ahead of us.Total revenue in the quarter fell 1.5 percent to $21.61 billion as some of the banks businesses, including mortgage lending, remained challenged.Loans rose marginally to $948.25 billion, with growth in commercial loans cushioning a 2 percent decline in loans made at its consumer unit.Total deposits fell 2 percent.Mortgage banking income rose 51.6 percent to $708 million from the fourth quarter, helped by a surprise spike in refinancing activity.Wells Fargo said its pipeline of unclosed mortgage applications was 33 percent higher than a year earlier.Last year, Wells Fargo was the top bank for refinanced mortgages with about 9 percent of the overall market, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.Wells Fargo advanced in two key profitability metrics during the quarter.Its net interest margin, which measures how much a bank earns on its deposits, rose to 2.91 percent from 2.84 percent a year earlier.The lenders efficiency ratio, a measure of cost per dollar of revenue, improved to 64.4 percent from 68.6 percent.Net income applicable to common stock rose reut.rs/2P8a214 to $5.51 billion, or $1.20 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $4.73 billion, or 96 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts had expected a profit of $1.09 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, but it was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.Shares of the lender were flat at $47.74 in early trading.
HSBC says number of jobs moved so far due to Brexit is tiny:::::BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - HSBC has so far moved only a tiny number of jobs to Paris in order to deal with Brexit, Chief Executive John Flint said on Friday, in the banks most detailed comments yet on its plans.FILE PHOTO: The HSBC bank logo is seen in the Canary Wharf financial district in London, Britain, March 3, 2016.REUTERS/Reinhard Krause/File Photo The total number of jobs moved is likely fewer than 100 of as many as 1,000 the bank has said it could ultimately transfer, Flint told Reuters on the sidelines of the banks annual shareholders meeting in Birmingham.I would imagine its tens, I dont know exactly but its a tiny number of people who have moved so far, Flint said.Chief Financial Officer Ewen Stevenson said the lender would likely slow the pace of moving the jobs due to recent uncertainty over the outcome of talks with the European Union.Prime Minister Theresa Mays repeated failure to get her withdrawal agreement through parliament has left lingering uncertainty as to when, or indeed if, Britain will exit the bloc.EU leaders agreed this week that Brexit was to be delayed until October 31.The update from Europes biggest bank on how many roles it has moved so far comes amid fears in Britain that Brexit could ultimately lead to a decline in Londons status as the contintents leading financial hub.A Reuters survey in February found financial services firms expected to move around 2,000 jobs as a result of Brexit, a fifth of the 10,000 flagged in a survey in September 2017.PENSION VOTE Shareholders at the meeting overwhelmingly voted against ending a form of pension cuts affecting thousands of former employees, following a protest by some of them outside the banks annual meeting in the central English city.The policy, under which former employees pensions are cut when they begin receiving state benefits, is known as a clawback, which some of the protesters referenced by dressing in lobster outfits.Advising shareholders to vote against the protesters proposal, HSBC Chairman Mark Tucker said the cuts were legal and fair, and fewer than 4 percent of votes cast were in favor.HSBC also faced questions from climate change activist groups over its financing of coal power-related projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam.The bank last year ended funding fossil fuel projects in all other countries, but said a lack of alternatives in those three meant it would continue there for now.We dont agree that we need to bring an immediate end to financing of all fossil fuels, Flint said.

Growth stumbling but central bank arsenals are near-empty:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Global economic growth is slowing, according to the International Monetary Fund, policymakers and hundreds of economists polled by Reuters - but that downturn is coming at a time when central banks arsenals are running on empty.FILE PHOTO: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) headquarters building is seen ahead of the IMF/World Bank spring meetings in Washington, U.S., April 8, 2019.REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo On Tuesday, the IMF cut its expectations for world growth to its lowest level since 2016, its third downgrade since October, and said risks to the global financial system have grown over the past six months.This is a delicate moment for the global economy, IMF chief economist Gita Gopinath told a news conference.Major central banks have reined in their forecasts, and in recent months economists in Reuters polls have repeatedly trimmed their expectations for the countries they cover.Last weeks releases provide some reassurance that the world economy is not falling off a cliff, which had seemed a plausible, if relatively small, risk as recently as a month or so ago.This is clearly good news, said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics.But we remain in the late stages of this global economic expansion.Springtime inevitably brings with it an air of optimism for the future but in the case of the world economy at least, we expect growth to remain subdued.Rising trade protectionism and tighter financial conditions have been blamed for the slowdown.Uncertainty over how to practically implement Britains June 2016 decision to quit the European Union has also played its part.Trade conflict with the United States and sluggish demand means Chinas economic growth is expected to slow to a near 30-year low of 6.2 percent this year, a Reuters poll showed on Friday.While still waging a trade war against China that is widely regarded as harmful to global growth, U.S. President Donald Trump has now threatened to slap tariffs on $11 billion of products from the EU.Those threats come as British politicians continue to struggle to agree on a way to leave the EU.A messy exit would almost certainly further damage the economies of both sides in the divorce, with the impact likely spreading further afield.In the early hours of Thursday, EU leaders gave Britain six more months to leave the bloc.But the latest extension still offers little clarity on when, how or even if Brexit will happen.British Prime Minister Theresa May has so far failed to build support in the UK parliament for the withdrawal terms she agreed with the EU last year, but she now has until Oct 31 to do that or find an alternative course.Brexit was originally supposed to have occurred two weeks ago but the intractability of the problem coupled with political incompetence on the part of the UK means that it has been postponed yet again, said Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank.The scope for lifting Brexit-related uncertainty is thus limited, which suggests little prospect of a sustainable rebound in either the economy or sterling.THE CUPBOARD WAS BARE What appears to be a globally synchronized economic slowdown comes as central banks run out of tools for supporting growth.After the 2008 financial crisis policymakers slashed interest rates - sometimes below zero - and also turned to more unconventional measures to boost growth, such as pumping trillions of dollars into economies.But as inflation has never really picked up, many of them have yet to change tack and start tightening.The U.S. Federal reserve led the pack and has hiked rates nine times in the current cycle, but it is probably now done with increases until at least the end of next year.The Bank of England has lifted Bank Rate twice since the June 2016 referendum, but borrowing costs remain very close to record lows and expectations for a rate hike later this year are far from set in stone.The European Central Bank, already on its longest break from changing interest rates, may have missed its chance to raise them this time around altogether.According to a median forecast in a Reuters poll, the first increase wont come until after June next year.FILE PHOTO: The Federal Reserve Board building on Constitution Avenue is pictured in Washington, U.S., March 27, 2019.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo On Wednesday, ECB President Mario Draghi even raised the prospect of more support for the struggling euro zone economy if its slowdown persisted, saying the central bank had plenty of instruments with which to react.However, one problem is that after pushing borrowing costs to record lows and taking 2.6 trillion euros worth of bonds out of the market, the ECBs options are limited and there are fears what it has will not be enough.Market pricing is expressing more anxiety that the ECB is either too slow to use whatever is left in its policy toolbox or worse that it thinks the tools wont do much anyway, said Laurence Mutkin, global head of G10 rates strategy at BNP Paribas.
Bayer says to comply with court mediation order in glyphosate case:::::FILE PHOTO: Logo of Bayer AG is pictured at the annual results news conference of the German drugmaker in Leverkusen, Germany February 27, 2019.REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay/File Photo FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Bayer said on Friday it would comply with a U.S. federal judges order to enter mediation with a plaintiff who claims the company failed to warn against an alleged cancer risk from its Roundup weedkiller.Bayer has seen billions wiped off its market value since August, when a first U.S. jury found Bayer liable because Monsanto, acquired by Bayer for $63 billion last year, had not warned of the alleged risk from Roundup, which is based on active ingredient glyphosate.It suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month and more than 10,000 cases are pending.U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria, who presided over the first two cases in federal court, said in a filing dated Thursday that Bayer and another plaintiff, Elaine Stevick, were ordered to start confidential mediation.The parties should propose a mediator in their case management statement; if they cannot agree, the Court will appoint someone, the judge ordered, cancelling a previously scheduled May 20 trial date.Bayer said on Friday it would comply with the order in good faith, while believing strongly in the extensive body of reliable science supporting the safety of Roundup.As this litigation is still in the early stages with only two verdicts and no cases that have run their course through appeal we will also remain focused on defending the safety of glyphosate-based herbicides in court, it said.
Oil has best run in three years; JPM earnings boost stocks:::::LONDON (Reuters) - Signs of stabilization in Chinas economy and a weaker dollar helped oil markets to their best run in more than three years on Friday, while global stocks edged up after JP Morgans results began the corporate earnings season in style.FILE PHOTO: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, April 11, 2019.REUTERS/Staff/File Photo Chinese data showed exports rebounded last month, helping to offset weaker imports and reports of another reduction in Germanys growth forecasts.Turkeys lira was back on the ropes amid worries about its trajectory.The euro gained despite the German growth concerns.Dealers were gearing up for demand from Japan as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial closed in on its multi-billion-euro acquisition of DZ Banks aviation-finance business.European markets shook off another slow start, as did Wall Street futures after strong earnings at JPMorgan drove shares of European and U.S. banks higher.The earnings seasons opening is likely to divert attention from the ongoing U.S.-China and U.S.-Europe trade war.BLACK GOLDS SPARKLING 2019 START Oil provided the big milestones.Brent was at $71.4 a barrel, having broken back through the $70 threshold this week, and U.S. WTI was heading for a sixth straight week of gains for the first time since early 2016.Involuntary supply cuts in Venezuela, Libya and Iran have supported perceptions of a tightening market, already constrained by production cut from OPEC and its allies.We expect oil price to eventually move higher in Q2 as OPEC+ potentially runs the risk of over-tightening the market by maintaining its current course of action, Harry Tchilinguirian, strategist at BNP Paribas, told the Reuters Global Oil forum.Commodities have had the best first-quarter start ever, Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said, calling the annualized returns they are tracking the strongest in the past 100 years.Taking advantage of strong prices and subdued valuations for oil producers, Chevron picked up Anadarko Petroleum Corp for $33 billion.SUBDUED SESSION Despite a subdued Asia session, Chinese blue chips managed to recover and close nearly flat.Higher Chinese iron ore prices helped push Australia up 0.85 percent.Japans Nikkei gained, too.The Chinese data was a little mixed, but the money supply numbers were a positive impulse overall, said TD Securities Senior Global Strategist James Rossiter.In bond markets, Germanys 10-year government yields reached three-week highs as investors cheered the rebound in Chinese exports, which gave hope that the global economic outlook is not as bad as expected.The move in German bonds ignored a report by Der Spiegel magazine that Berlin was set to halve its economic growth forecast for 2019, to 0.5 percent from 1.0 percent.That would be more pessimistic than the current 0.8 percent estimate from Germanys leading economic institutes.Worries about European growth also made the European Central Bank cautious at a policy meeting earlier this week.Britains sterling rose after British finance minister Philip Hammond said he expects a Brexit deal in the next couple of months.FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians are reflected on an electronic board showing stock prices outside a brokerage in Tokyo, Japan December 27, 2018.REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund managing director, said on Thursday that the six-month delay in Britains exit from the European Union avoids the terrible outcome of a no-deal Brexit, although it did nothing to lift uncertainty over the final outcome.Gold crept higher after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday to break below $1,300 following solid U.S. data.Spot gold traded at $1,292.41 per ounce.For a graphic on Falling volatility, see - tmsnrt.rs/2X40O8U
Alibaba founder defends overtime work culture as 'huge blessing':::::SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Alibaba Group founder and billionaire Jack Ma has defended the grueling overtime work culture at many of Chinas tech companies, calling it a huge blessing for young workers.FILE PHOTO: Alibaba Group co-founder and Executive Chairman Jack Ma attends Alibaba Group's 11.11 Singles' Day global shopping festival in Shanghai, China, November 12, 2018.REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo The e-commerce magnate weighed into a debate about work-life balance and the overtime hours demanded by some companies as the sector slows after years of breakneck growth.In a speech to Alibaba employees, Ma defended the industrys 996 work schedule, which refers to the 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. workday, six days a week.I personally think that being able to work 996 is a huge blessing, he said in remarks posted on the companys WeChat account.Many companies and many people dont have the opportunity to work 996, Ma said.If you dont work 996 when you are young, when can you ever work 996?The issue has fueled an online debate and protests on some coding platforms, where workers have swapped examples of excessive overtime demands at some companies.Ma, a former English teacher who co-founded Alibaba in 1999 and has become one of Chinas richest people, said he and early employees regularly worked long hours.In this world, everyone wants success, wants a nice life, wants to be respected, Ma said.Let me ask everyone, if you dont put out more time and energy than others, how can you achieve the success you want?Ma referred to the tech industry today where some people are without jobs, or working at companies in search of revenue or facing closure.Compared to them, up to this day, I still feel lucky, I dont regret (working 12 hour days), I would never change this part of me, he said.This month activists on Microsofts GitHub, the online code repository site, launched a project titled 996.ICU where tech workers listed Alibaba among the companies ranked as having some of the worst working conditions.On Thursday, an opinion piece published in a state newspaper argued that 996 violated Chinas Labor Law, which stipulates that average work hours cannot exceed 40 hours a week.Creating a corporate culture of encouraged overtime will not only not help a business core competitiveness, it might inhibit and damage a companys ability to innovate, the unnamed author wrote in the Peoples Daily.
Mexico ready to retaliate by hurting American corn farmers:::::Mexico is ready to hit the U.S. where it hurts: Corn.Mexico is one of the top buyers of American corn in the world today.And Mexican senator Armando Rios Piter, who leads a congressional committee on foreign relations, says he will introduce a bill this week where Mexico will buy corn from Brazil and Argentina instead of the United States.It's one of the first signs of potential concrete action from Mexico in response to President Trump's threats against the country."I'm going to send a bill for the corn that we are buying in the Midwest and...change to Brazil or Argentina," Rios Piter, 43, told told CNN's Leyla Santiago on Sunday at an anti-Trump protest in Mexico City.He added: It's a "good way to tell them that this hostile relationship has consequences, hope that it changes."American corn goes into a lot of the country's food.In Mexico City, from fine dining restaurants to taco stands on the street, corn-based favorites like tacos can be found everywhere.Related: Mexican farmer's daughter: NAFTA destroyed us America is also the world's largest producer and exporter of corn.American corn shipments to Mexico have catapulted since NAFTA, a free trade deal signed between Mexico, America and Canada.American farmers sent $2.4 billion of corn to Mexico in 2015, the most recent year of available data.In 1995, the year after NAFTA became law, corn exports to Mexico were a mere $391 million.Experts say such a bill would be very costly to U.S. farmers."If we do indeed see a trade war where Mexico starts buying from Brazil...we're going to see it affect the corn market and ripple out to the rest of the ag economy," says Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN, an agricultural management firm.Rios Piter's bill is another sign of Mexico's willingness to respond to Trump's threats.Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall on the border, and he's threatened taxes on Mexican imports ranging from 20% to 35%.Trump also wants to renegotiate NAFTA.He blames it for a flood of manufacturing jobs to Mexico.A nonpartisan congressional research report found that not to be true.Related: Mexico doubles down on Trump 'contingency plan' Still, Trump says he wants a better trade deal for the American worker -- though he hasn't said what a better deal looks like.All sides signaled two weeks ago that negotiations would begin in May after a 90-day consultation period.But Trump says if negotiations don't bear the deal he wants, he threatens to withdraw from NAFTA.Such tough talk isn't received well by Mexican leaders like Rios Piter.He's not alone.Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said in January Mexico would respond "immediately" to any tariffs from Trump."It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature," Guajardo said Jan. 13 on a Mexican news show.--Shasta Darlington contributed reporting to this story
Will the next iPhone charge wirelessly?:::::You may never have to plug in your iPhone again.Apple has joined an industry group devoted to wireless charging, strengthening existing rumors that the next iPhone will charge without a cord.The Wireless Power Consortium, which is made up of some 200 organizations that promote a single wireless charging standard, confirmed to CNNTech that Apple joined the group last week.IPhone rumors swirl months before each new version is announced, and hype around the so-called 'iPhone 8" is particularly high: Apple (AAPL) is expected to unveil a major redesign of the this fall to mark the 10-year anniversary of the smartphone.The company has already shown interest in doing away with cumbersome cords.The Apple Watch charges wirelessly, provided consumers spend $79 on a magnetic charging dock.And the latest MacBook now comes with only one USB port.Related: Apple stock nears a record high Apple would also create another iPhone revenue stream by selling a wireless charging station separately.The feature would simplify charging for smartphone owners.Rather than plugging in one's phone, a user would only need to place it on the charging dock.Apple said in a statement Monday it was joining the Wireless Power Consortium to contribute its ideas as wireless charging standards are developed.As for the speculated possible features of the next iPhone, other rumors include an edge-to-edge display, a glass body and the removal of the home button.
How 'America First' could turn into 'India First':::::America is great because of its willingness to accept talented immigrants.That's what Nandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Technologies, would tell President Trump if he had the opportunity."If you really want to keep the U.S. ... globally competitive, you should be open to overseas talent," Nilekani said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.Infosys (INFY) is India's second-largest outsourcing firm, and a major recipient of U.S. H-1B visas.The documents allow the tech firm to employ a huge number of Indians in U.S. jobs.The Trump administration is now considering significant changes to the visa program.Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in January that Trump will continue to talk about reforming the H-1B program, among others, as part of a larger push for immigration reform.Curbs on the visas could hit Indian workers hardest.India is the top source of high-skilled labor for the U.S. tech industry.According to U.S. government data, 70% of the hugely popular H-1B visas go to Indians.Shares in several Indian tech companies -- including Infosys -- plunged spectacularly two weeks ago amid reports of an impending work visa crackdown.Related: Tech industry braces for Trump's visa reform Nilekani said it would be a mistake for the administration to follow through."Indian companies have done a great deal to help U.S. companies become more competitive, and I think that should continue," Nilekani said."If you look at the Silicon Valley ... most of the companies have an immigrant founder."India's contribution to the industry -- especially at top levels -- has been outsized.The current CEOs of Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), for example, were both born in India.Related: India freaks out over U.S. plans to change high-skilled visas But Nilekani, who is also the architect of India's ambitious biometric ID program, suggested that India would ultimately benefit from any new restrictions put in place under Trump's "America First" plan.If talented engineers can't go to the U.S., they will stay in India."This issue of visas has always come up in the U.S. every few years, especially during election season," he said."It's actually accelerated the development work [in India], because ... people are investing more to do the work here."Nilekani cited his own projects for the Indian government as an example.The Bangalore-born entrepreneur left Infosys in 2009 to run India's massive social security program, which is known as Aadhaar.As a result of the initiative, the vast majority of India's 1.3 billion citizens now have a biometric ID number that allows them to receive government services, execute bank transactions and even make biometric payments."It was built by extremely talented and committed Indians," Nilekani said."Many of them had global experience, but they brought that talent and experience to solve India's problems."Nilekani said the country's massive youth population is increasingly choosing to stay home and pitch in."It's India first," he said.
Swiss voters reject corporate tax overhaul:::::Voters in Switzerland have shocked the political establishment by rejecting a reform plan that would have brought the country's corporate tax system in line with international norms.The tax reforms, which were widely supported by the business community, would have removed a set of special low-tax privileges that had encouraged many multinational companies to set up shop in Switzerland.Experts say the future of Switzerland's tax system is now unclear.The vote result could create headaches for firms that had been banking on their implementation, and deter companies who had been considering a move to the country."They do not know what [tax] measures will be available... That is not a very solid basis for making investment decisions," Peter Uebelhart, head of tax at KPMG in Switzerland, said in a video statement.Switzerland has come under intense pressure from G20 and OECD nations in recent years to clean up its tax system.The country runs the risk of being "blacklisted" by other nations if it doesn't change its tax system by 2019.Many voters rejected the tax reform package over fears it might reduce the amount of revenue collected by the government, according to Stefan Kuhn, head of corporate tax at KPMG in Switzerland.That might have lead to tax hikes on the middle class.The current tax system gives preferential treatment to some companies with large foreign operations.International tax authorities say the rules amount to unfair corporate subsidies.Martin Naville, head of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, said it's possible that voters didn't understand the complexities of the reforms.The measures were rejected by 59% of voters."I think it's a very bad day for Switzerland," Naville said."Clearly, the uncertainty and the credibility in the Swiss [system] has taken a massive hit."Related: How Europe's elections could be hacked Swiss authorities say they will move quickly to create a modified tax reform proposal.Naville said he hopes new rules are devised within the next few months."All stakeholders now have to take responsibility to develop an acceptable competitive tax system, and to regain credibility regarding the famed political stability which gave Switzerland such an advantageous position," he said in a statement.Naville hinted that potential tax reforms in the U.S. and U.K. could tempt Swiss-based companies to relocate, putting more pressure on Switzerland's tax base.
Stocks hit record again. But is Trump the reason?:::::The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 each hit new all-time highs Monday.Investors are giddy with excitement and they clearly believe that both big blue chip multinationals and smaller companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will continue to thrive.So is this the Donald Trump rally?Or the Janet Yellen rally?Some strategists believe Trump's stimulus plans and talk of killing many burdensome regulations are the reasons stocks are soaring.Or perhaps this is better characterized as a continuation of the Barack Obama rally instead?You could argue that POTUS 44 has dealt POTUS 45 a pretty good hand.The solid job market and overall economy that Trump inherited may be the reason consumers and businesses are so confident.But investors (and financial journalists) are often quick to give the president more credit -- and blame -- than they probably deserve for the performance of the stock market.RBC strategist Jonathan Golub pointed this out in a report on Monday, one that was aptly titled "Message to Market: It's Not All About Donald."Related: Trump isn't killing the bull market Golub noted that the S&P 500 rose nearly 7% from late June through Election Day -- a time when most polls were predicting that Hillary Clinton would be the next president.But stocks have continued to rally since then, rising another 8% since Trump pulled off the upset (at least to the mainstream media and Wall Street) victory.You can't have it both ways.It makes no logical sense to suggest that stocks rallied because investors believed Trump would lose and that they continued to rally because Trump didn't lose.Bond yields have also been rising since Trump won, a phenomenon that many investors have attributed to the likelihood of stimulus from the president and Republican Congress.Yet Golub points out that the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury was going up during the late summer as well.Of course, many investors were expecting stimulus from Clinton too.Yet once again, many investors are claiming that Trump is the catalyst for something that not only was going on before he was elected, but was happening because many thought he would lose.Related: Stocks have avoided a 1% dive for an unusually long period of time So it's odd that Trump is being cited as the main reason for a market rally that began months before anyone felt he could win.What's really going on?The one constant during the past few months is the Federal Reserve.Yes.the markets are reacting to Washington.But they are paying closer attention to Janet Yellen, not the White House.The Fed made it crystal clear before the election that it would probably raise interest rates in December and do so a few more times in 2017 regardless of who won the race for president.The good news for investors is that the U.S. economy seems to be growing steadily, but does not appear to be at risk of overheating.Related: Here's why the world's largest money manager is worried The most recent jobs report showed that wages grew at a decent rate of 2.5% annually.But that's not nearly high enough to spark fears of runaway inflation and lead the Fed to aggressively raise rates.Even if Yellen and the Fed hike rates three times this year, they are likely to do so by just a quarter point every time.That would push the Fed's key short-term rate to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%.That's still extremely low.At those levels, stocks would still be more attractive than bonds.Corporate earnings should be able to keep rising at a healthy clip.And consumers would probably keep spending.So investors would be wise to keep a close eye on Yellen and not just have a myopic focus on the president, With that in mind, Yellen is set to testify in front of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.And what she says about the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes could wind up keeping the rally going full steam ahead -- or stopping it dead in its tracks.
Apple stock nears record high:::::Apple has found its groove again.The iPhone maker's stock hit $133.82 in early trading Monday, putting Apple less than $1 away from its intraday trading high of $134.54, reached in April 2015.Apple's stock ended the day at $133.29, beating its previous record closing price of $133, set in February 2015.The stock surge, pushing Apple (AAPL) to a $700 billion market cap, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone.Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the stock on Monday, citing the likelihood of "major new features" like "3D sensing" being added to the next iPhone model, according to an investor note provided to CNNMoney.Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the "mother of all upgrades."Since then, however, Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year.The newest models on the market today look nearly identical to the iPhones available in late 2014.The long wait, combined with this year marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, has only raised expectations that Apple is about to significantly overhaul its smartphone and reignite demand.Related: Tim Cook: 'Apple would not exist without immigration' Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters.Apple even cut its CEO's pay by 15% due to the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits.But that losing streak just ended.Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus.The company sold 78.3 million iPhones for the quarter, setting a new record.At least some of that may be due to the Samsung's smartphone recall woes.Mark Moskowitz, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in an investor note this month, "Samsung's Note 7 struggles likely helped."The iPhone isn't the only reason Wall Street is excited about Apple.There's also President Trump.Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts.Apple currently has $230 billion in cash held in foreign accounts.If Trump and Congress make it cheaper for Apple to bring that money back, it could be used for acquisitions and buybacks.
America's NAFTA nemesis: Canada, not Mexico:::::America and Canada have one of the world's biggest trade relationships.President Donald Trump met for the first time Monday with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau."We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada," Trump said at the news conference.But the U.S.-Canada trade relationship over the years has not been as smooth as you might think.There have been trade wars, acts of retaliation, allegations of dumping and jobs lost."Our trading relationship obviously is strong...but the relationship has been rocky, despite the agreements we have in place," says Stuart Trew, an editor at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a research group in Ottawa, Canada's capital.Trump has often slammed Mexico and NAFTA, the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.But Canada is rarely mentioned.Yet, there have been more NAFTA dispute claims against Canada -- almost all by U.S. companies -- than against Mexico.Even today, Canada has stiff tariffs against the United States and the two sides only recently resolved a bitter dispute over meat.Most leaders and experts stress that trade ties between the two nations are strong and mostly positive.But Canada and America have had plenty of battles along the way.Now Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, which will be on the top of the agenda for his meeting with Trudeau.1.Canada gets in more NAFTA trouble than Mexico Listening to Trump, you might think Mexico is the bad actor of NAFTA.But since NAFTA's inception in 1994, there have been 39 complaints brought against Canada, almost all by U.S. companies.Known in the industry as the investor state dispute settlements, it allows companies to resolve cases under a special panel of NAFTA judges instead of local courts in Mexico, Canada, or the U.S.There's only been 23 complaints against Mexico.(By comparison, companies from both Mexico and Canada have filed a total of 21 complaints against the U.S.) And increasingly, Canada is the target of American complaints.Since 2005, Canada has been hit with 70% of the NAFTA dispute claims, according to CCPA, a Canadian research firm.2.The U.S. - Canada lumber battle NAFTA isn't the only sore area.In 2002, the U.S. slapped a roughly 30% tariff on Canadian lumber, alleging that Canada was "dumping" its wood on the U.S. market.Canada rejected the claim and argued the tariff cost its lumber companies 30,000 jobs."It was a very sour point in Canadian - American relations for quite a while," says Tom Velk, an economics professor at McGill University in Montreal.The dispute had its origins in the 1980s, when American lumber companies said their Canadian counterparts weren't playing fair.Whether Canada actually broke the rules is a matter of dispute.Canadian officials deny that the government is subsidizing softwood lumber companies in Canada.American lumber companies still allege that it does, and a U.S. Commerce Department report found that Canada was providing subsidies to lumber companies in 2004.It didn't say whether the subsidies were ongoing.According to the allegations, Canada subsidized lumber companies because the government owns many of the lands where the wood comes from.That subsidy -- on top of Canada's huge lumber supply -- allowed Canada to price its lumber below what U.S. companies can charge.The World Trade Organization ultimately sided with Canada, denying America's claim and the two sides came to an agreement in 2006 to end the tariff.However, that agreement and its ensuing grace period expired in October, and the two sides are back at it again.The Obama and Trudeau administrations couldn't reach a compromise before Obama left office and it remains a contentious trade issue with U.S. lumber companies calling once again for tariffs.Related: 'Without NAFTA' we'd be out of business 3.Smoot-Hawley triggers U.S. - Canada trade war Things got even worse during the Great Depression.In 1930, Congress wanted to protect U.S. jobs from global trade.So the U.S. slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield workers.It was called the Smoot-Hawley Act.Today, it is widely accepted that this law made the Great Depression worse than it was.Canada was furious, and retaliated more than any other country against the U.S., sparking a trade war."Canada was so incensed that...they raised their own tariff on certain products to match the new U.S. tariff," according to Doug Irwin, a Dartmouth Professor and author of "Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression."For example, the U.S. increased a tariff on eggs from 8 cents to 10 cents (these are 1930s prices, after all).Canada retaliated by also increasing its tariff from 3 cents to 10 cents -- a threefold increase.Exports dwindled sharply: in 1929, the U.S. exported nearly 920,000 eggs to Canada.Three years later, it only shipped about 14,000 eggs, according to Irwin.Related: Remember Smoot-Hawley: America's last major trade war 4.Canada's sky high tariffs on U.S. eggs, poultry, milk Fast forward to today.Smoot-Hawley is long gone, but Canada continues to charge steep tariffs on U.S. imports of eggs, chicken and milk.For instance, some tariffs on eggs are as high as 238% per dozen, according to Canada's Agriculture Department.Some milk imports, depending on the fat content, are as high as 292%."They're so onerous that you can't bring it across.There's no American eggs in Quebec," says Velk.According to Canada's Embassy in the U.S., reality is much different.Its officials say that despite some stiff tariffs, Canada is one of the top export markets for American milk, poultry and eggs.The U.S. does have tariffs on some goods coming from all countries, but they are not nearly as high as Canada's.Experts say these tariffs continue to irk some U.S. dairy and poultry farmers, some of whom are challenged to sell into the Canadian market.But they doubt much will change since the tariffs have been in place for decades now.Related: Those Reagan tariffs Trump loves to talk about 5.COOLer heads and the future of NAFTA Despite all these disputes, experts stress this trade relationship is still one of the best in the world.In fact, the two countries are so interconnected now, when trade disputes erupt sometimes American companies will side with Canadian companies and against U.S. lawmakers.For example, Canadian meat producers disputed a U.S. law that required them to label where the cattle was born, raised and slaughtered.Canadians said the law discriminated against its meat from being sold in the U.S. and took the case to the WTO.The WTO sided with Canada, and last December, Congress repealed the country-of-origin-labeling law.American meat producers -- whose business is intertwined with Canada -- actually supported their counterparts in Canada, arguing the regulation was too burdensome.As for Trump's proposal of tearing up NAFTA, many American and Canadian experts say that it's not worth it to renegotiate or end the agreement.The three countries that are part of the agreement are so enmeshed with each other that untangling all that integration would be detrimental to trade and economic growth.--Editor's note: This story was originally published on August 11, 2016.We have since updated it.
Verizon's new plan: Consumers win, investors lose:::::Verizon has brought back its unlimited data plan.That's great if you're a Verizon customer.But it is terrible news for its investors.Verizon (VZ) stock fell nearly 1.5% in early trading Monday.It's now down about 10% so far this year, making it the Dow's worst performer of 2017.Verizon's move is a clear sign the company has to pull out all the stops to remain competitive with wireless rivals AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS)."In recent months, both T-Mobile and Sprint had some success taking additional share from Verizon by virtue of their unlimited offerings," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report Monday morning.That may explain why shares of T-Mobile and Sprint, which is now controlled by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, are both up this year while Verizon is down.T-Mobile and Sprint have also been perennially linked as possible merger partners.But the new telecom price war isn't the only problem for Verizon.AT&T recently acquired satellite broadcast provider DirecTV, a move that makes Ma Bell more competitive against Verizon in the battle to control people's living rooms.Verizon offers its own FiOS broadband TV service.Related: Verizon brings back unlimited data plans And AT&T is also making a much bigger bet on content, with plans to purchase CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX).Verizon already owns AOL and is looking to buy the core assets of Yahoo to bolster its own digital content offerings.But the Yahoo (YHOO) deal could fall apart in the wake of revelations of massive data breaches at Yahoo over the past few years.Yahoo recently said it hopes that the deal with Verizon will close in the second quarter of this year.It was originally supposed to be finalized by the first quarter.However, in its latest earnings release, Verizon simply said that it "continues to work with Yahoo to assess the impact of data breaches" -- not that it expected the deal to close anytime soon.Verizon has a lot on its plate, which could be making investors nervous.In addition to the Yahoo deal, the company is also in the process of buying the fiber optic network of XO Communications.And it's selling its data center business to Equinix (EQIX).There also have been rumors in the past few weeks that Verizon might even consider buying cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR).That may be more than Verizon can realistically handle right now.But nothing may be off the table for Verizon given how competitive the wireless world is these days.Anything that could give Verizon a leg up on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile might be possible.Related: Charter shares popped on report of possible Verizon takeover Still, it's worth noting that shares of AT&T are lower this year too, down about 5%.And Verizon and A&T have something in common that Sprint and T-Mobile lack -- Verizon and AT&T pay gigantic dividends.Companies that have big dividend yields haven't fared as well since Donald Trump was elected.Investors are betting on a sizable stimulus package from him and the Republican Congress, which may be fueled in part by debt.That's caused bond yields to rise -- and that makes shares of big dividend payers like Verizon a lot less attractive.The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a few times this year too.That could push bond yields even higher.So Verizon faces many big challenges that could hurt its stock this year.That's why Verizon, nicknamed Big Red because of its logo's crimson hue, may see its stock in the red for the foreseeable future.
Oil prices have doubled in a year. Here's why:::::It's a good day for OPEC.Data published Monday by the oil cartel show its members have largely complied with an agreement to slash production.The confirmation caps a remarkable year for OPEC, which was forced to devise a plan to boost prices after they fell to $26 per barrel in February 2016.The price collapse -- to levels not seen since 2003 -- was caused by months of growing oversupply, slowing demand from China and a decision by Western powers to lift Iran's nuclear sanctions.Since then, the market has mounted a stunning turnaround, with crude prices doubling to trade at $53.50 per barrel.Here's how major oil producers worked together to push prices higher: OPEC deal OPEC agreed major production cuts in November, hoping to tame the global oil oversupply and support prices.The news of the deal immediately boosted prices by 9%.Investors cheered even more after several non-OPEC producers, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, joined the effort to restrain supply.Crucially, the deal has stuck.The OPEC report published Monday showed that its members have -- for the most part -- fulfilled their pledges to slash production.The International Energy Agency agrees: It estimated OPEC compliance for January at 90%.UAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNNMoney on Monday that the results were even better than he had expected.The production cuts total 1.8 million barrels per day and are scheduled to run for six months.Related: OPEC has pulled off one of its 'deepest' production cuts Investors upbeat The OPEC deal took months to negotiate, and investors really, really like it.The number of hedge funds and other institutional investors that are betting on higher prices hit a record in January, according to OPEC.The widespread optimism is helping to fuel price increases.Higher demand The latest data from OPEC and the IEA show that global demand for oil was higher than expected in 2016, thanks to stronger economic growth, higher vehicle sales and colder than expected weather in the final quarter of the year.Demand is set to grow further in 2017 to an average of 95.8 million barrels a day, compared 94.6 million barrels per day in 2016.The IEA said that if OPEC sticks to its agreement, the global oil glut that has plagued markets for three years will finally disappear in 2017.Saudi oil minister: I don't lose sleep over shale What's next?Despite the stunning growth, analysts caution that prices may not go much higher.That's because higher oil prices are likely to lure American shale producers back into the market.The total number of active oil rigs in the U.S. stood at 591 last week, according to data from Baker Hughes.That's 152 more than a year ago.U.S. crude stockpiles swelled in January to nearly 200 million barrels above their five-year average, according to the OPEC report."This vast increase in inventories is a result of a strong supply response from the U.S. shale producers, who were not involved in the OPEC agreement and who have instead been using the resultant price rally to increase output," said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index.More supply could once again put OPEC under pressure.
Tesla is going to sell electric cars in the Middle East:::::Tesla is bringing its electric cars to the heart of the oil producing world.The automaker announced Monday that its first official venture in the Middle East will be in the United Arab Emirates.The first cars -- the Model S and Model X -- will hit the road this summer."Timing seems to be good to really make a significant debut in this region starting in Dubai," Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said at the World Government Summit in Dubai.Tesla owners will have access to two existing supercharging stations in the UAE, and Telsa plans to open five more by the end of the year.Despite sitting on huge oil and gas reserves, the UAE has ambitious plans to go green.Last month it said it will invest $163 billion to boost alternative energy use over the next three decades.Related: Tesla reveals what it will charge for a charge It's the latest in a series of expansion announcements for Tesla.Last week, Musk hinted that Tesla may soon come to India.Musk has also teased plans to build "heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport" as well developing a ride-hailing network, which could be similar to Uber.Speaking in Dubai, the entrepreneur expounded on the future of robotics."We will see autonomy and artificial intelligence advance tremendously," Musk said."In probably 10 years, it will be very unusual for cars to be built that are not fully autonomous."Related: Elon Musk's surprising secret weapon: Trump?But he also warned of the "disruptive" nature of autonomous vehicles."That disruption I'm talking about will take place over about 20 years.Still, 20 years is a short period of time to have something like 12% to 15% of the workforce be unemployed."Musk said governments must pay close attention to artificial intelligence, create sustainable transport and be wary of mass unemployment."This will be a massive social challenge.Ultimately, we need to think about universal basic income.I don't think we have a choice," he said."There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better."-- Seth Fiegerman contributed reporting.
Indian rival slams Uber's business model:::::Uber's top rival in India has some unsolicited advice for the U.S. startup: Go local."They have a very cookie-cutter approach in terms of what the model is and how [to] force feed it into any geography," Pranay Jivrajka, a top executive at Ola Cabs, said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.Jivrajka, who until recently served as Ola's COO, said that Uber should ditch its one-size-fits-all approach and instead try to understand "local nuances" that would help it to identify services that "users and drivers actually want."Uber declined to comment on Jivrajka's remarks.Uber and Ola have for years waged a bitter battle for supremacy in India, a market with 1.3 billion potential customers.The country has taken on increased significance for Uber after a series of recent setbacks elsewhere in Asia.The San Francisco-based company suspended its operations in Taiwan last week, six months after it sold its operations in China to local rival Didi Chuxing.Didi, which is taking the fight to Uber in key foreign markets, is one of Ola's investors.In India, Uber has often found itself playing catch-up with its Bangalore-based rival.Its most recent local product offering -- allowing Indian users to book a car for an entire day -- is already offered by Ola in 85 cities.Ola also lets users book one of India's ubiquitous three-wheeled auto rickshaws, a service Uber started but then discontinued in 2015."What has helped us is having an ear to the ground in terms of understanding what the users want," said Jivrajka.Related: Uber's rivals are teaming up in Asia Uber CEO Travis Kalanick insists that his company is not prepared to leave India."We are losing, but we see a path towards profitability," Kalanick said during a December visit to Delhi."We see ourselves being here in the long run."Related: Uber suspends its service in Taiwan as fines mount India isn't always a straightforward market for either company -- tens of thousands of drivers representing both Uber and Ola went on strike in Delhi this week, demanding better pay and benefits.The Delhi government has offered to mediate the dispute.Jivrajka did not comment on the protests, but said that Ola's main focus remains bringing more drivers onto its platform."We need more drivers because the pace at which demand is increasing is way higher than the way supply is getting aggregated," he said.Related: Uber CEO drops out of Trump's business advisory council Jivrajka also had some advice for another Silicon Valley giant hoping to enter India: electric automaker Tesla."There are no rules on the Indian roads," Jivrajka said."One thing a lot of people say is that if you can drive in India, you can drive anywhere."-- Manveena Suri contributed reporting
Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for "massive campaign" against fake news:::::Apple CEO Tim Cook wants the tech industry to take action against "fake news" stories that are polluting the web."There has to be a massive campaign.We have to think through every demographic," Cook said in a rare interview.Speaking with The Daily Telegraph newspaper, Cook also said "all of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news."Other leading tech company CEOs, like Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, have spoken about the problem in recent months.But Cook's comments were much more frank.According to the Telegraph, he said made-up stories and hoaxes are "killing people's minds."And he called the "fake news" plague "a big problem in a lot of the world."The term "fake news" was originally coined to describe online stories that are designed to deceive readers.Often times these stories are shared on Facebook and other social networking sites to generate profits for the creators.Other times the stories are essentially propaganda made up for political purposes.These kinds of stories received widespread attention before and after the American election.Fictional stories with titles like "Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for president" won millions of clicks.It can be very difficult for web surfers to tell the difference between legitimate news sources and fakes.That's where companies like Apple come in.In the Telegraph interview -- part of a multi-day European trip -- Cook said "too many of us are just in the complain category right now and haven't figured out what to do."He urged both technological and intellectual solutions."We need the modern version of a public-service announcement campaign.It can be done quickly if there is a will," Cook told the newspaper.What he described is music to the ears of media literacy advocates."It's almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid," Cook said.There are scattered efforts in some schools to teach media literacy, with a focus on digital skills, but it is by no means universal.When asked if Apple would commit to funding a PSA campaign, an Apple spokesman said the company had no further comment on Cook's interview.The Apple CEO also suggested that tech companies can help weed out fake stories, though he added, "We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press."Apple's own Apple News app has been credited with being a relatively reliable place to find information.The company "reviews publishers who join Apple News," BuzzFeed noted last December.And the app has a "report-a-concern function where users can flag fake news or hate speech."Facebook recently started working with fact-checkers to test "warning labels" that show up when users share made-up stories.Cook, in the newspaper interview, expressed optimism that the "fake news" plague is a "short-term thing -- I don't believe that people want that at the end of the day."
Trump brand takes another hit:::::Nordstrom.Neiman Marcus.TJ Maxx.And now, Sears and Kmart.Sears Holdings, the company that owns retail stores Sears and Kmart, reportedly said this weekend that it would remove 31 Trump-branded items from its website.The company pulled the products as part of a plan to focus on its "most profitable items," Sears spokesman Brian Hanover told Reuters.Hanover told the news organization that items in the Trump Home line of furnishings were removed from the company's website, although they could still be purchased through third-party vendors online.Neither store carried the items in their physical stores, he said.Searches of the Sears and KMart websites did not turn up Trump Home products, except for those sold by third-party vendors.In a statement Monday, spokesman Chris Brathwaite distanced Sears from any political controversy and reiterated that many Trump-branded products are still available through third-party sellers."In this case, certain products were removed from our websites that included a very small number of Trump products," he said."The headlines do not do justice to our business or this specific brand of products that we offer through our marketplace sellers."Brathwaite added that the company prefers to focus on its business and "leave the politics to others."Related: Is Ivanka Trump's brand losing its bling?The move makes Sears the latest to ditch products bearing the Trump name.Earlier this month, Nordstrom (JWN) cited brand "performance," not politics, as the reason why it decided to stop carrying Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories label.President Trump knocked the department store on Twitter in retaliation.Nordstrom stock jumped 7% in the first two days following the tweet.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom.She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing!Terrible!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Other stores have also sought to distance themselves from Ivanka Trump's brand.Neiman Marcus removed the brand landing page from its website, and declined to tell CNNMoney whether it intended to keep Ivanka Trump products in stores or resume online sales in the future.TJX Companies (TJX), the company that owns TJ Maxx and Marshalls, also said that it had recently told workers not to highlight the first daughter's brand in stores.And retailer Belk said last week that it planned to pull Ivanka Trump's products from its website, but would continue to offer the line in its flagship stores.Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories line has taken a hit in recent months.Online sales of her brand dipped 26% in January compared to a year earlier, according to Slice Intelligence, a retail analysis firm.Slice studied the brand's sales on five online stores: Nordstrom, Amazon, Zappos, Macy's and Bloomingdale's.Online sales of Ivanka's brand had surged in late 2015, and last month's numbers appear to be more of a "return to reality," according to Taylor Stanton, Slice's marketing and communications manager.The brand's dip in performance was abnormal in light of an uptick in 2016 online sales in the apparel and accessories category, said Jack Beckwythe, a Slice analyst.Related: Kellyanne Conway unrepentant for Ivanka Trump plug The Ivanka Trump brand has defended its performance.Rosemary Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, told CNNMoney last week that the brand was growing and experienced "significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016.""We believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains," Young said.Retailers like Bloomingdale's, Amazon (AMZN), Lord & Taylor, Macy's (M) and Zappos all still carry Ivanka Trump products.Ivanka Trump has taken a leave of absence from her namesake company since her father won the presidency.She has no formal role in the administration but is expected to have a voice on issues such as women's empowerment and child care.--CNNMoney's Jackie Wattles contributed to this story.
This company makes food packaging out of bamboo to cut down on trash:::::To tackle Thailand's mounting trash problem, one company is turning to the country's plant life.Universal Biopack makes packaging that it sells to restaurants and manufacturers.But rather than plastic, it uses a mixture of bamboo and cassava, crops that are widely found across the country.After growing rapidly in recent decades, Thailand has become one of Asia's biggest economies.But like many other countries in the region, it's been slow to try to combat the millions of tons of trash produced each year."Waste management is a big problem everywhere," said Universal Biopack's managing director, Vara-Anong Vichakyothin.Related: The company turning 4 billion plastic bottles into clothes The company is using a technology devised at a Bangkok university to make its zero-waste packaging.It hopes it will eventually replace many of the Styrofoam boxes and plastic bags that end up in huge garbage dumps across Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries.Its eco-friendly formula took five years to develop and is so adaptable it could end up being used to package things like furniture and even phones.The bamboo it uses comes from leftover scraps from the chopstick manufacturing process.In the cities of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, where takeout drink containers and noodle packets line the sidewalks, the company supplies restaurants, organic farmers and other businesses in the food and drink industry.But finding new clients can be tricky.Takeout food vendors in Thailand want to keep costs down in a competitive business with thin margins.Asking them to spend more on packaging for environmental reasons is a tough sell."The local economy still does not support [this technology]" said Universal Biopack's founder, Suthep Vichakyothin.But that hasn't stopping other companies from entering the sustainable packaging market in Thailand.Like Universal Biopack, they're betting on growing environmental awareness eventually leading to an increase in demand.To become more competitive, Suthep's company is investing.It's aiming to ramp up production by building a partially automated assembly line at its factory near Bangkok and doubling its staffing from 50 people to 100.The goal is to increase monthly capacity from 300,000 units to one million.Related: A startup that makes pencils that grow into vegetables A lot of the demand comes from overseas.One of its customers uses the natural packaging for coconut water it exports.Universal Biopack says it's also getting interest in its products from other countries, particularly in Scandinavia.
LeBron, Serena and other Nike stars champion 'Equality':::::Nike says it's time to stand up for equality in a new ad campaign.The company on Sunday launched a star-studded short film titled "Equality" to mark Black History Month.The ad features Nike-sponsored athletes LeBron James, Serena Williams, Kevin Durant, Gabby Douglas, among others, "amplifying their voices in an effort to uplift, open eyes and bring the positive values that sport can represent into wider focus," the company said.Actor Michael B. Jordan voices the film, and singer Alicia Keys performs a rendition of Sam Cooke's "A Change is Gonna Come."If we can be equals in sport, we can be equals everywhere.#EQUALITY pic.twitter.com/ki5NaJN12d Nike (@Nike) February 12, 2017 "Is this the land history promised?"Jordan says."Here, within these lines, on this concrete court, this patch of turf, here, you're defined by your actions -- not your looks or beliefs."Nike will feature ads from the campaign on social media, billboards and posters throughout cities in the United States and Canada.It will also sell "Equality" branded T-shirts and shoes as part of its annual Black History Month collection.Apparel from the campaign will be worn by Nike athletes during NBA All-Star weekend.Nike said it is donating $5 million this year to organizations like MENTOR and PeacePlayers, which it says "advance equality in communities" across the country.Related: Pro-Trump boycott calls follow Super Bowl ads Nike's new campaign comes one week after numerous companies launched ads about inclusion and acceptance during the Super Bowl.Budweiser, 84 Lumber, Coca-Cola (COKE), Airbnb, Kia and Tiffany (TIF) were among the brands that features messages about immigration, equality and environmentalism.-- CNNMoney's Ahiza Garcia contributed to this story.
'Lego Batman' producer today. Treasury secretary tomorrow?:::::Steven Mnuchin had a pretty good weekend.First the treasury secretary pick advanced a step closer toward confirmation on Friday.Then his latest movie claimed the top spot at the box office.Mnuchin is an executive producer on Warner Bros.' "The Lego Batman Movie," which pulled in an estimated $55.6 million from U.S. audiences during its opening weekend.CNN, like Warner Bros., is owned by Time Warner.The kid-friendly spinoff of 2014's "The Lego Movie" handily beat its raunchy competitor, Universal's "Fifty Shades Darker."The sequel to 2015's "Fifty Shades of Grey," based on a best-selling series of romance novels, debuted at $46.8 million in the United States.Related: Possible pick for Treasury secretary makes his film debut Mnuchin is listed as a producer or executive producer on 34 films in recent years, including last summer's "Suicide Squad," which brought in $786 million worldwide.He also produced "The Lego Ninjago Movie," another Lego franchise spinoff that will hit screens this fall.Mnuchin is widely expected to be serving as Treasury secretary by then.Following a 53-46 vote last Friday to break a Democratic filibuster, Mnuchin is scheduled for a final vote before the full Senate at 7 p.m. Monday.--CNNMoney's Frank Pallotta and CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this story.
The last thing Europe needs: another Greek crisis:::::How's this for dj vu?Another debt crisis is brewing in Europe.Greece needs European creditors to release cash from a bailout agreed in 2015 so it can make debt repayments, but officials are at loggerheads.Investors are starting to worry, demanding higher returns on Greek debt.Adding to the confusion is a warning from the International Monetary Fund that Greece's debt is unsustainable and on an "explosive" path, an assessment that prevents the fund from participating in a rescue.The timing could hardly be worse.European leaders have a lot on their plate.Elections are looming in the Netherlands, France and Germany.Brexit negotiations will begin within weeks.Yet the threat of Greece tumbling out of the euro demands attention.Here's why the next few weeks will be key: Hammer to fall Greece is running out of cash, but it needs to make repayments to creditors including the European Central Bank.Major bills are coming due in July.If Greece cannot make the payments, it will default on its debt and spiral out of the eurozone.Meanwhile, its latest bailout -- the third since 2010 -- is effectively frozen.The negotiating positions of major players are further apart than at any point since the bailout was agreed in June, 2015.There is even disagreement over the size of the problem facing Greece."The IMF's latest review of Greece's debt position was surprisingly pessimistic," said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs meetings of top eurozone finance officials."It's surprising because Greece is already doing better than that report describes."I want it all The IMF, Greece and creditors led by Germany all have very different priorities.Here's what each wants: The IMF has called on Greece to make more ambitious changes to its economy, including labor market reforms.The IMF didn't join the third bailout when first agreed in 2015 because it did not view Greece's debt as being sustainable.It still maintains that Greece cannot be self sustaining without major debt relief.Greece's main creditors agree that Athens should implement the reforms proposed by the IMF.However, they have categorically ruled out any debt relief, a position reiterated by eurozone finance officials on Tuesday.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, meanwhile, shows no sign of yielding to demands for additional reforms.He insists that debt relief is needed before any new concessions are made.It's a classic standoff and investors are watching to see which party blinks first.Put out the fire The next major milestone is a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Feb. 20 -- the last before elections start muddying Europe's political waters.Agreeing yet more financial aid for Greece will become even harder once voters start casting their ballots.After that, bills will start coming due.Greece faces a payment to the ECB of roughly 1.4 billion in late April and another 4.1 billion in July.The stake are high.The unemployment rate in Greece is expected to run above 21% in 2017.Investment is down by more than 60% and output has contracted by more than 25% since the financial crisis.The country's social fabric is fraying.If European creditors refuse further help, Greece's debt will spiral out of control no matter how quickly its economy grows, according to the IMF.That will leave only one option -- abandoning the euro.Ted Malloch, President Trump's expected choice for U.S. ambassador to the EU, told Greek television on Tuesday that the eurozone's future would be decided in the next 18 months."Certainly there will be a Europe, whether the eurozone survives, I think it's very much a question that is on the agenda," he said."I think this time I would have to say that the odds are higher that Greece itself will break out of the euro."
Verizon is bringing back unlimited data:::::Verizon VZ Starting Monday, Verizon customers can get unlimited data, talk and text for $80.The company says the new introductory plan also includes up to 10 GB of mobile hotspot usage, as well as calling and texting to Mexico and Canada.It will also allow customers to stream unlimited HD video, thumbing its nose at T-Mobile's controversial practice of lowering video quality for some of its unlimited data customers.Although the new Verizon plan promises "fast LTE speeds," those using a lot of data may suffer.The company said that after a customer uses 22 gb of data on a line during any billing cycle, it "may prioritize usage behind other customers in the event of network congestion."That has become standard practice on all networks that offer unlimited data plans.Related: T-Mobile and Sprint offer new 'unlimited' data plans -- sort of Verizon first eliminated its version of an unlimited usage plan in 2011, following similar decisions by other major wireless carriers.But companies have been steadily reviving such plans.Verizon first overhauled its data-usage plans last summer when it introduced a new "Safety Mode" plan.That technically gave customers access to unlimited data, but they were subjected to slow-as-molasses speeds after they went over their allotted data.AT&T similarly eliminated overage fees for customers in September.Like Verizon, AT&T throttles customers speeds once they reach the data limit on their plans.The company brought back unlimited plans earlier last year, but it is only available for homes with both AT&T's wireless phone service and either DirecTV or U-Verse TV.Meanwhile, competitors T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) made their own bids to attract customers looking for "unlimited data" plans.Nearly all NYC subways get cell service Last August, Sprint began offering a plan to give customers unlimited talk, text and high-speed data for $60 for the first line, $40 for the next, and $30 for each additional up to 10.The T-Mobile plan, announced the same day as Sprint's, charged $70 a month for the first line, the second at $50 and additional lines are only $20, up to eight lines.
Visa crackdown puts these rural doctors at risk:::::At his pediatrics practice in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Dr. Alaa Al Nofal sees up to 10 patients a day.He's known some of them since they were born.Others, he still treats after they've graduated from high school."I treat these children for Type 1 diabetes, thyroid problems, thyroid cancer, puberty disorders and adrenal gland diseases," he said.Al Nofal's expertise is critical.He is one of just five full-time pediatric endocrinologists in a 150,000 square-mile area that covers both South and North Dakota.Like most of rural America, it's a region plagued by a shortage of doctors."We're very lucky to have Dr. Al Nofal here.We can't afford to lose someone with his specialization," said Cindy Morrison, chief marketing officer for Sanford Health, a non-profit health care system based in Sioux Falls that runs 300 hospitals and clinics in predominantly rural communities.Related: Visa ban could make doctor shortage in rural America even worse Yet, Sanford Health may lose Al Nofal and several other doctors who are crucial to its health care network.A Syrian citizen, Al Nofal is in Sioux Falls through a special workforce development program called the Conrad 30 visa waiver -- which basically waives the requirement that doctors who complete their residency on a J-1 exchange visitor visa must return to their country of origin for two years before applying for another American visa.The Conrad 30 waiver allows him to stay in the U.S. for a maximum of three years as long as he commits to practicing in an area where there is a doctor shortage.After President Donald Trump issued a temporary immigration ban restricting people from seven Muslim-majority countries -- including Syria -- from entering the U.S., Al Nofal is unsure about his future in America."We agree that something more has to be done to protect the country, but this executive order will have a negative effect on physicians from these countries who are badly needed across America," said Al Nofal."They may no longer want to practice in the United States."The action is currently in legal limbo after a federal appeals court temporarily halted the ban.Related: Trump furious after court upholds block on travel ban Over the last 15 years, the Conrad 30 visa waiver has funneled 15,000 foreign physicians into underserved communities.Sanford Health has 75 physicians in total on these visa waivers and seven are from the countries listed in the executive order."If we lost Dr. Al Nofal and our other J-1 physicians, we would be unable to fill critical gaps in access to health care for rural families," said Sanford Health's Morrison.And the ban could hurt the pipeline of new doctors, too.The Conrad 30 visa waiver program is fed by medical school graduates holding J-1 non-immigrant visas who have completed their residencies in the U.S. More than 6,000 medical trainees from foreign countries enroll every year in U.S. residency programs through J-1 visas.About 1,000 of these trainees are from countries caught up in the ban, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges.J-1 visa holders who were out of the country when the ban went into effect were prohibited from entering the U.S. and unable to start or finish school as long as the ban is in place.The State Department told CNNMoney that the government may issue J-1 visas to people who are from one of the blocked countries if it is of "national interest," but would not confirm whether a doctor shortage would qualify for such consideration."The stress and concern generated by the short-term executive order could have long-term implications, with fewer physicians choosing training programs in the states and subsequently magnifying the deficit in providers willing to practice in underserved and rural areas," said Dr. Larry Dial, vice dean for clinical affairs at Marshall University's school of medicine in Huntington, West Virginia.Related: Obamacare's impact on this Alaska town with only one doctor's office Al Nofal went to medical school in Damascus, Syria's capital, and completed his residency at the University of Texas on a J-1 visa.He proceeded to a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic and then applied for a J-1 waiver, which placed him in Sioux Falls.Nineteen months into his three-year commitment, Al Nofal is either directly treating or serving as a consulting physician to more than 400 pediatric patients a month on average.He sees most of his patients at the Sanford Children's Specialty Clinic in Sioux Falls, where families often drive hours for an appointment.Once a month, he flies in a small plane to see patients in a clinic in Aberdeen, about 200 miles away."It's not easy being a doctor in this setting," said Al Nofal, citing the long hours and South Dakota's famously frigid winters."But as a physician, I'm trained to help people whatever the circumstances and I'm proud of it."It's one of the reasons why Al Nofal and his American wife Alyssa have struggled to come to terms with the visa ban."I have a 10-month old baby and I can't travel to Syria now.My family in Syria can't come here," he said."Now my family can't meet their first grandson.""I know if we leave I probably can never come back," he said.Neither does he want to travel anywhere in the country right now."I'm afraid of how I will be treated," he said.He's also afraid he will be stopped at the airport -- even if he's traveling to another state.Related: Trump travel ban and what you need to know Almatmed Abdelsalam, who's from Benghazi, Libya, had planned to start practicing as a family physician in Macon, Georgia, through the visa waiver program after he completed his residency at the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine in July.Everything was going smoothly.Abdelsalam, who treats hospital patients and veterans, applied for the visa waiver and was accepted.He signed an employment contract with Magna Care, which provides physicians to three hospitals in the Macon area and he had started looking at houses to relocate himself, his wife and their two young kids over the summer.But there was one last step.For his J-1 waiver application to be fully completed, it needs to get final approval from the State Department and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services."The executive order came in the middle of that process, stalling my application at the State Department," he said.Because he's a Libyan citizen (Libya is also subject to the visa ban), Abdelsalam is fearful of the outcome."The hospital in Macon urgently needs doctors.Even though they've hired me, I'm not sure how long they can wait for me," he said."No one can argue it's necessary to keep the country safe, but we should also keep the country healthy," he said."Doctors like me, trained in the U.S. at some of the best schools, are an asset not a liability."
Trump isn't killing the bull market. Here's why:::::More and more business leaders and Wall Street strategists are expressing their worries about what President Donald Trump's protectionist policies and unpredictable nature might do to the markets and economy.But we all know that action speaks louder than words.What investors are actually doing is in stark contrast to what people are saying.The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs again on Friday.And the Russell 2000, an index of small company stocks that tend to do most of their business in the U.S., is now just a few points away from the all-time high it hit last December in the wake of Trump market euphoria.What's more, the VIX (VIX), a measure of volatility known as Wall Street's fear gauge, is down nearly 25% this year as well.If investors were really scared of Trump, the VIX should be much higher.And CNNMoney's own Fear & Greed Index, which looks at the VIX and six other measures of investor sentiment, is showing signs of Greed and is not far from Extreme Greed levels.Of course, Trump still can't seem to help himself from tweeting about things that, let's be honest, won't do anything to help the economy -- although Nordstrom investors are richer despite Trump attacking them for dumping his daughter Ivanka's brand.But to give credit where it's due, it looks like the main reason that stocks have taken off again lately is because Trump has promised to unveil a "phenomenal" tax plan soon.Related: Rare streak for U.S. stocks: Long stretch without a 1% dive Trump also pledged again to invest more on infrastructure when he met with airline CEOs on Thursday.That's what the market wants to hear."We still expect fiscal stimulus, lower taxes and less regulation," said Matt Lockridge, manager of the Westwood Small Cap Value Fund."The timing is the big question, but it's coming."Lockridge thinks that many companies that generate a majority of their revenues from America should benefit if Trump stimulus winds up kicking the economy into a higher gear.He likes stocks in a variety of industries, such as movie theater owner Masco (MAS), snack food firm J & J (JJSF) and aerospace equipment company Kaman (KAMN).Another money manager said he's also still bullish on small U.S. stocks that could get a lift from Trump policies.Related: Wall Street has powerful seat at Trump's table Barry James, president and CEO of James Investment Research, said he bought the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) the day after the election because he's confident Trump's stimulus plan will boost growth for U.S small businesses."When Trump said America first, I really think that's what he means," James said, adding that he thinks Internet phone service Vonage (VG), rent-to-own retailer Aaron's (AAN) and discount chain Big Lots (BIG) could all thrive if Trump's proposals go through.But there's another reason why the U.S. markets are near all-time highs.Despite all of the uncertainty in Washington, the U.S. is still viewed as a paragon of relative stability compared to other parts of the world.Europe's economy is still a big wild card thanks to Brexit, the rise of populism in France leading to worries about a so-called Frexit and more worries about the problem that never seems to go away -- Greece's debt woes.Japan's economy remains stagnant as well.We're talking about more than just a lost decade now.It's plural.And China's economy is slowing down too.Bond fund manager Bill Gross has often joked that America is like what Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson sang about in "Sunday Morning Coming Down" -- the "cleanest dirty shirt."To that end, analysts at bond rating firm Fitch wrote in a report Friday that "elements of President Trump's economic agenda would be positive for growth," but added that "the present balance of risks points toward a less benign global outcome."Of course, there are two sides to that coin.Trump's bombast could come back to haunt him.Related: Oreo make is worried about rise of populism His continued penchant for reprimanding companies that he disagrees with on Twitter could dent investor confidence.And while his proposed travel ban on immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries has been overturned by the U.S. court system for now, the president has vowed to fight for its reinstatement.Even if he loses that battle, it's still clear that Trump is serious on turning more inward, with plans for tariffs and border-adjusted taxes that could ignite trade wars with Mexico, China and Japan.That could hurt big U.S. multinational firms and lead to job cuts.But investors still seem to believe/hope that the merits of Trump's pro-growth stimulus plans and tax cuts will outweigh the impact of isolationism.Let's hope they're right.Investors may be holding their noses, closing their eyes and stuffing cotton in their ears to drown out the president.But they are still buying stocks.
Jet Airways halts all international flights until Monday:::::Image copyright Getty Images Passengers are stranded in India and around the world after Jet Airways suspended all international flights.Flights from London, Paris and Amsterdam are among those grounded amid fears about the survival of India's largest private airline.The airline cancelled all international flights until Monday when, according to reports, it will meet its lenders again to try to secure funding.Jet Airways is saddled with more than $1bn (765m) of debt.It is seeking a financial lifeline to avoid collapse and, on Thursday, grounded 10 planes over unpaid fees to leasing firms .These were the latest flights to be grounded and it was not clear how many of its fleet of more than 100 planes was still in operation.Local reports suggested that it was barely a dozen.The airline flies on 600 domestic and 380 international routes - but carriers in India must maintain a fleet of least 20 aircraft to continue to operate international services.From London, the airline initially confirmed it had cancelled its flights between London, Paris and Amsterdam and India for 12 April, but later said that all international flights would be cancelled between 12 and 15 April.It said it "regrets the inconvenience caused" to its passengers and was "working to minimise guest inconvenience"."In parallel, the airline's management and its key stakeholders including its consortium of lenders, continue to work closely towards resolving the current situation," it said.There was no statement about the status of domestic flights.Wedding party delay Sandeep Kooner and her three children had been expecting to be on a flight from London to India on Friday evening to attend her niece's wedding in Punjab.But the 40 year-old who lives in Walsall will now miss the first few days of the week-long celebrations after her Jet Airways flight was cancelled."I had just sat down in the nail salon when I got a text message to say my flight had been cancelled," she told the BBC.She has now arranged to fly with Air India, but that will be days later and to Delhi - an eight hour drive to her destination - rather than a local one."I'm not 100% sure my problem is 100% sorted," she says.'Necessary steps' Television channels in India reported that the prime minister's office had called for an urgent meeting to discuss the airline.They also reported remarks by government officials saying Jet Airways only had funds to operate six to seven aircraft over the weekend.India's Aviation Minister, Suresh Prabhu, had tweeted that his ministry would "review issues related to Jet Airways" and "take necessary steps to minimise passenger inconvenience and ensure their safety".The UK's Civil Aviation Authority said it was aware flights had been suspended.Jet Airways owes money to employees and suppliers and in recent weeks it has grounded aircraft and cancelled thousands of flights as its financial strains worsened.The pilots union in India is planning a protest on Saturday and has written to the airline demanding that employees are paid.Staff of the airline were pictured by Priyanka Iyer of Business Television India marching to the company's headquarters in Mumbai.Rare intervention By Sameer Hashmi, India business correspondent In March, when the crisis at Jet Airways led to thousands of flights being cancelled, the government immediately stepped in and asked public sector banks to rescue the private carrier.It was a rare move.With India holding a national election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government did not want the airline to be grounded as that would have affected 23,000 jobs.The lenders which took control of the airline have only released a fraction of the amount they had promised so the airline has not been able to pay aircraft leasing companies.This means its fleet has shrunk further from the 100-plus it had at the start of the year.The lenders have started accepting bids from potential investors, but that process will take a couple of months to complete.And many analysts fear that Jet Airways will not survive even a week if immediate cash is not provided to keep the operations running.Investment sought The airline was founded by Naresh Goyal more than 25 years ago and he and his family currently own 52% of the airline, although that majority stake is expected to be lost as lenders' restructure the debt.A consortium of investors led by the State Bank of India (SBI) took control of the airline in March.The group is searching for a new investor to acquire a stake of up to 75% in Jet Airways.The deadline for bids had been extended to Friday, according to reports.Ellis Taylor, deputy Asia editor of Flight Global, told the BBC the airline was in a "precarious position"."The interim lifeline that the carrier talked about two weeks ago looks like it won't materialise any time soon, and that really leaves its future looking bleak," he said.There were reports in local media that India's aviation ministry might review the regulations setting the fleet cap, which could allow the airline to resume international services.
Hammond: Brexit deadlock leaves little room for key issues:::::It is time to get Brexit "off the table" so that Britain can focus on other issues, the chancellor has said.Philip Hammond told the BBC that getting a deal done soon would release the "bandwidth" needed to take key economic decisions facing the country.He called the UK's involvement in May's European elections "pointless" and hoped a deal would be done before then.Mr Hammond was speaking in Washington, where he is attending World Bank and IMF meetings.The chancellor said talking to the Labour Party about finding a way forward to resolve the Parliamentary impasse was not his "preferred route".But it offered a new way forward to achieve a Brexit deal, after which he could concentrate on issues such spending and "where our economy is going over the next few years"."I would like us to spend more of our bandwidth focused on growing our economy," he told the BBC's economics correspondent Dharshini David."Until a deal is done we cannot make decisions about the spending review."'All will be forgotten' If a deal on leaving the EU cannot be agreed by the end of May, the UK is committed to fighting the European elections."Clearly nobody wants to fight the European elections.It feels like a pointless exercise, and the only way we can avoid that is by getting a deal agreed and done quickly."If we can do that by 22 May, we can avoid fighting the European parliamentary elections."In any case, we want to ensure any British MEPs that are elected never have to take their seats in the European Parliament by ensuring this is all done well before the new European Parliament convenes," he said.The chancellor is in Washington at the World Bank and IMF spring meetings.He rejected suggestions that the handling of Brexit negotiations was being seen overseas as a national humiliation."Britain is known as a bastion of democracy, and how we manage a challenging and complex issue like this is of huge interest," he said."In a year's time, when this is behind us and people are focussed on other things, all this will be forgotten."
LK Bennett bought but 15 stores to close:::::Image copyright Reuters High-end fashion chain LK Bennett has been bought out of administration, saving 325 jobs.However, 15 of the retailer's stores are not included in the deal and will close, leading to the loss of 110 jobs.LK Bennett has been bought by Byland UK which was set up by Rebecca Feng, who runs the company's Chinese franchises.The sale includes the company's headquarters, 21 stores and all of its concessions.The amount paid has not been disclosed.Ms Feng said: "Under our plan, the business will continue to operate out of the UK, looking to maintain the long-standing and undoubted heritage of the brand."This will be achieved through a combination of working with quality British design, and the business's existing supply chain."The UK stores not included in the sale and which will now close are: Bath Belfast Birmingham Bridgewater, Banbridge City, Royal Exchange, London Glasgow Gloucester King's Road, London Knightsbridge, London Long Acre, London Northcote Road, London St Albans Westgate Oxford York York Outlet The administrators said the company's international subsidiaries were also not included in the sale and would remain in administration.LK Bennett was founded by Linda Bennett in 1990, and counts the Duchess of Cambridge as a customer.Ms Bennett sold her majority stake in the chain to private equity firm Phoenix Equity Partners in 2008, but in 2017 returned to advise the business after the retailer started to struggle.She bought the company back a short time later.The chain reported an operating loss of nearly 6m in the year to the end of July 2017, the most recent results available for the firm.The accounts show that on her return, Ms Bennett invested about 11.2m into the business.LK Bennett called in the administrators last month, and five stores - Sheffield Meadowhall, Bristol, Liverpool, London Brent Cross and London Westbourne Grove - were closed.Shortly before the business fell into administration, Ms Bennett emailed staff saying she had "fought as hard as I can, with all your help, to turn the business into the success that I know it deserves to be"."These are difficult and unstable times, and we are doing everything we can to identify the best way forward," she had said.
Jumia: 'Africa's Amazon' in landmark stock market listing:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jumia delivers goods via scooter and offers a variety of payment options Shares in Africa's largest e-commerce firm have debuted on the New York stock market, which could see other tech start-ups on the continent follow suit.Jumia is listing 17.6% of the company at $14.50 a share, giving the company "unicorn" status - a technology start-up worth $1bn-plus.It is the first tech start-up from Africa to float on Wall Street.The so-called "Africa's Amazon" has 4 million customers on a continent where just 1% of retail sales are via online.Jumia was founded in Lagos, Nigeria, by two French entrepreneurs in 2012 and now offers services to most of the African population, in countries such as South Africa, Tanzania, Egypt and Ivory Coast.Its largest shareholder is MTN, Africa's biggest telecoms company.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A Jumia Food customer orders food on the app The company said on Friday that the flotation on the New York Stock Exchange would raise $196m (150m) for shareholders and for future investment.Jumia's financial advisers had been pitching the shares to investors at between $13-$16 each.Jumia operates in 14 countries, including Kenya, Ghana, Algeria, Angola, and Senegal.The website sells everything from electronics to clothes, and there is a hotel and flight booking site, and a takeaway food delivery platform.In Kenya, Jumia has teamed up with French supermarket giant Carrefour to offer online deliveries.The company's sales jumped by almost 40% last year to $147.3m.The BBC's Africa Business Editor, Larry Madowo, said that Jumia was not yet profitable and had accumulated losses of nearly $1bn since it was founded.Although there are technical and infrastructure hurdles to growing Africa's online retail market, he said a big selling point was that Jumia accepted mobile money payments across a continent where few people have credit or debit cards.However, he said Jumia faced tougher competition."Its initial public offering coincides with the launch of a competing app from global logistics provider DHL allowing consumers in 11 African countries to buy directly from global retailers."The DHL Africa eShop brings together more than 200 American and British retailers and will deliver directly to homes, something Jumia has struggled with."Erik Hersman, chief executive of Nairobi-based internet and software firm BRCK, said Jumia's listing sent an important signal to other African start-ups that a major stock market listing was possible."It's an important event in the evolution of the African tech scene," he told the BBC last month.
Bounty pregnancy club fined £400,000 over data handling:::::Image copyright Getty Images Pregnancy club Bounty UK has been given a 400,000 fine for illegally sharing the personal information of more than 14 million people.The fine was issued by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) in what it said was an "unprecedented" case.Bounty compiled personal data but did not tell people that it was shared with 39 other organisations, said the ICO.Bounty said it "acknowledged" the ICO's findings and had now made changes to how it handled member data.'Careless' data-sharing The Bounty pregnancy and parenting club offers free samples, vouchers and guides to prospective and new parents via packs given out in hospitals or sent to people who use its apps.Bounty gathered information from apps, its website, cards in merchandise packs and from new mothers in hospital.The ICO said that while many knew Bounty as a pregnancy club, few knew that it was also a data broker supplying information to third parties that would use it to fine-tune direct marketing.Bounty breached the 1998 Data Protection Act by not being "open and transparent" with people about what would be done with their personal data.Image caption Bounty took data in hospitals and from apps and merchandise packs It shared 34.3 million records from June 2017 to April 2018 with 39 organisations including marketing agencies Acxiom, Equifax and Indicia.The data shared was of "potentially vulnerable" people including new mothers and very young children, said the ICO."The number of personal records and people affected in this case is unprecedented in the history of the ICO's investigations into the data broking industry and organisations linked to this," said Steve Eckersley, the watchdog's director of investigations.Mr Eckersley said the "careless" data-sharing was likely to have caused distress to many people because they did not know it was being shared so widely.Jim Kelleher, Bounty's managing director, said: "In the past, we did not take a broad enough view of our responsibilities and as a result our data-sharing processes, specifically with regards to transparency, were not robust enough."He added that the ICO had recognised that Bounty had changed its data-handling policies and that it now kept fewer records for less time.It had also ended relationships with all data brokers.Staff had also been trained to handle data to comply with the latest legislation.In addition, said Mr Kelleher, Bounty planned to appoint an independent data expert to carry out an annual survey to ensure it did not breach data protection laws.
Nando's and Wetherspoons win Preston local business awards:::::Image caption Cheeky win: Nando's was a hot favourite in the restaurant of the year category A public vote designed to celebrate local businesses in one city backfired - after Nando's and Wetherspoons took top prizes.Business luminaries in Preston had invited independent outfits to compete in their Smiles Better Awards show.But residents in the Lancashire city made their feelings known - plumping for the two national chains in favour of the homegrown competition.A local restaurateur said it "doesn't show Preston in a great light".Peri-Peri chicken chain Nando's was hot favourite in the restaurant of the year category, while pub of the year was won by JD Wetherspoons outpost the Twelve Tellers.'Like Boaty McBoatface' Mark O'Rourke, who owns a group of local eateries, said it wasn't fair to put local independents up against national chains."Wherever you go in the country and go into a Wetherspoons or a Nando's, it's the same as the last one you went into," he said.Mr O'Rourke, who runs We Don't Give A Fork, Fino Tapas and the Otter's Pocket in the city centre, was awarded multiple retailer of the year.However, he said his complaints were "not about me winning more awards" but about giving local businesses a chance.Others agreed with Mr O'Rourke.James Burns wrote that it was "pretty hard" to defend Preston in light of the results.While Chris Eyles-Chaloner likened the vote to the Boaty McBoatface episode - where a comedy suggestion won a competition to name a polar research vessel.Skip Twitter post by @No1_EC Nando's ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha .It's like the public choosing boaty Mc boatface.What a funny and massive waste of time ha ha ha ha ha ha ha Chris Eyles-chaloner (@No1_EC) April 11, 2019 Report A spokesman for Preston BID, which organised the awards, said they were open to any business operating in the city centre.He said almost 68,000 votes were cast by the public, and "They alone determine their favourite clubs, bars, stores, pubs and restaurants".Nearly 50% of the awards were presented to the independent sector, he said, adding: "It only goes to show that the independent sector can hold their own against the national brands."
Online grocery shopping growth slowing, says Mintel:::::Image copyright Getty Images Online grocery shopping in the UK is set to grow more slowly, with customers worried about order problems and delivery charges, research indicates.Last year, 45% of consumers said they shopped for groceries online, down from 49% in 2016, said analysts Mintel.Mintel also found 42% of older people said they had never bought groceries online and had no interest in doing so.The survey of 2,000 internet users found that 63% said they had had an issue with an order in the past year.Mintel's associate director of retail research, Nick Carroll, said: "Online grocery is, alongside the food discounters, one of the fastest-growing segments within the wider grocery sector."However, growth is slowing and the number of users is plateauing as retailers struggle to encourage new customers to try their services."Last year, online grocery deliveries made up 7% of the whole sector, with a value of 12.3bn.Mintel said this was forecast to hit 10% by 2023, with sales rising to 19.8bn.Fresh produce The survey found evidence of a disparity between enthusiastic younger people and sceptical older shoppers who were suspicious of online grocery shopping.Only 35% of those aged 45 and over had used such services.Of those who refused to shop online, 73% said they preferred to choose fresh products themselves.Nearly a quarter - 24% - of reluctant online shoppers thought delivery charges were too high, while 18% did not like being subject to minimum spending levels.'Big basket' Among those who had used online grocery services, complaints included missing products, late deliveries, incorrect substitutions and receiving goods that were damaged or close to their expiry dates.Online grocery shopping is an increasingly important factor in the strategies of big food retailers, notably with Marks & Spencer spending 750m to acquire a 50% share of online firm Ocado's retail business.However, Mintel's Mr Carroll also pointed out that not all shopping trends were working in favour of the internet.He said: "Most importantly, online services are still best suited to the traditional big-basket weekly shop, at a time when consumers are increasingly shopping on a top-up or when-needed basis."
Uber warns it may not make a profit in IPO documents:::::Image copyright Getty Images Uber, the ride-sharing app and delivery business, has warned it "may not achieve profitability" as it finally released details of its plan to float.It will list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, in a deal likely to value the US firm at about $100bn (76.5bn).Uber said that its most recent annual sales rose to $11.2bn and losses narrowed to $3bn.But it also expects operating expenses to "increase significantly".The company did not disclose how it will price its shares when it begins selling them to public investors on the stock exchange.However, it has been reported that they may be valued at between $48 and $55 each, potentially giving the 10-year old firm a value of up to $100bn, making it the biggest initial public offering this year.Uber is also expected to raise about $10bn through the flotation.'Stronger team' Chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi, who replaced Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick, said in a letter: "Over the past 18 months, we have improved our governance and board oversight; built a stronger and more cohesive management team; and made the changes necessary to ensure our company culture rewards teamwork and encourages employees to commit for the long term."When Mr Khosrowshahi took over as chief executive in 2017, the company was struggling to recover from a number of scandals, including a toxic work environment that was exposed by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler.It has also faced numerous legal issues, including whether the people who work for the company are classed as staff and are therefore entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage.Uber is one of a number of so-called unicorns - private investor-backed companies worth $1bn or more - that are planning initial public offerings this year.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Uber's smaller rival Lyft has seen its share price sink 15.2% since its flotation at the end of March.However, there are questions about investor appetite for these companies, which have attracted high valuations in the private market, but are yet to make a profit.Uber's smaller rival, Lyft, was the first of the group to float, but since listing at the end of March, its share price has fallen by 15.2% to $61.Meanwhile, Pinterest, the virtual scrapbook, has priced its shares at between $15 and $17 each, valuing the firm at as much as $11.3bn which is below its $12bn valuation in its most recent private funding round in 2017.Pinterest's listing, which is expected next week, could raise up to $1.2bn in funding for the firm.
Ethnic minorities facing insecure work, says TUC:::::Image copyright Getty Images Black, Asian and other ethnic minority workers are a third more likely to be "trapped" in insecure work than white counterparts, says the TUC.One in 19 white employees are on zero-hours or temporary work contracts.The figure for ethnic minority workers is one in 13, according to the TUC report, which uses figures from the government's Labour Force Survey.The report said discrimination in the labour market was placing them under significant financial stress.Black and Asian workers were twice as likely to report not having enough hours to make ends meet, the TUC said.The report was released at the start of the TUC's annual black workers' conference.TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Far too many BME workers are stuck in low-paid, insecure and temporary work."This has a huge impact on their living standards and life chances."This problem isn't simply going to disappear over time.We need a co-ordinated approach led by government to confront inequality and racism in the labour market - and wider society."The TUC is calling for the government to ban zero-hours contracts and offer all workers guaranteed hours.It also wants legislation to bring in mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting for all companies with more than 50 employees.
IMF's Lagarde says further Brexit delay will 'hinder' UK growth:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Christine Lagarde says she hopes a Brexit deal can be struck quickly Further uncertainty over Brexit will hinder growth in the UK economy, the head of IMF has told the BBC.Speaking ahead of the agreement of an extension to Article 50, Christine Lagarde warned that businesses and investors will remain hesitant in the coming months.She said any prolonged uncertainty would have a "negative impact".Ms Lagarde, a former French finance minister, said she hoped a deal could be struck quickly.Speaking at the World Bank and IMF Spring Meetings in Washington, Ms Lagarde said: "If there was a prolonged uncertainty, we can suspect that the impact on confidence would continue because, you know, whether you're talking about investors, whether you're talking about decisions as to where to expand where to set up how to organize a supply chain, people are going to wonder, you know, what comes next and and how will it settle?"So it would have a negative impact, no question about it. "Ms Lagarde also expressed sympathy with the plight of British businesses.She highlighted that even with the contingency plans in place, they would face disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit and may have to be resigned to taking a hit to their balance sheets and possibly market share.'Very sad' Earlier in the week, the IMF warned that no deal would cause the UK economy to shrink, echoing the scenarios published by the Government and the Bank of England.Revealing her personal insight, the IMF managing director said the Brexit process was "very, very concerning on the one hand and very sad"."I grew up across the Channel and in the city of Le Havre, and to me being able to go across to Southampton, in an easy and unhampered way, was wonderful."Ms Lagarde told journalists that "Having my positive hat on it removes the risk of the no-deal Brexit on April 12, so at least the UK is not leaving on April 12 without a deal."We believe that the no deal Brexit would have been a terrible outcome."Brexit is among risks the IMF has flagged at what it termed a delicate time for the global economy in its World Economic Outlook, with others including trade tensions between the US and China and high corporate debt levels in many countries.It said it hoped to see a rebound in global growth later this year but admitted that was "precarious".
Philip Green brings in new blood as he prepares to swing axe:::::Image copyright Getty Images Sir Philip Green has appointed two restructuring specialists to the boards of his Arcadia retail empire as he prepares a major overhaul.Jamie Drummond Smith, chairman of finance group Cattles, becomes chairman of Topshop, Topman, Arcadia Group, and the ultimate parent company Taveta.He was previously Cattles' chief restructuring officer.Peter Bloxham, ex-head of restructuring and insolvency at law firm Freshfields, is also appointed to the board.Mr Bloxham has been advising the company on its future plans.Their expertise is particularly relevant as Sir Philip is preparing to announce a big restructuring which is expected to involve a form of insolvency proceedings called a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), allowing the company to exit or reduce rental agreements with retail landlords.Many other retailers - including the BHS stores group, once owned by Arcadia - used a similar mechanism when it was fighting, unsuccessfully, for survival.The appointments fill gaps left on the various boards after the resignation of Lady Karren Brady and Sharon Brown, who left after a series of allegations of inappropriate conduct towards female and black employees by Sir Philip.Sir Philip lost two more directors last week when his biggest outside investor, US based Leonard Green Partners sold its 25% stake in Topshop.Sir Philip is also in negotiations with the pensions regulator to try and reduce the 50m in annual cash the company is contributing towards its 500m pound deficit.Arcadia's restructuring is expected to be announced in early May.
Pensioners to protest at HSBC's annual meeting:::::Image copyright SharonMcGeough-Adams Image caption Sharon McGeough-Adams will be campaigning at HSBC's annual general meeting Sharon McGeough-Adams faces losing 200 a month from her HSBC pension and will protest at the bank's annual general meeting on Friday to demand changes.Having worked for the UK's biggest bank for more than 37 years, she says it is money that could be put aside for other necessities, such as fuel.The loss is caused by the bank's move to reduce pension payments when the recipient receives state pension.HSBC has said it would cost 450m to stop the practice for future payments.Ms McGeough-Adams is one of 52,000 members of the pension scheme - technically the 1974 Midland Bank defined benefit pension scheme - whose company pensions will be reduced when they reach state retirement age.A campaign group she helped form has requisitioned a vote at the annual general meeting (AGM) which calls for the bank to "abolish, or effectively remedy, the unfair discriminatory practice".As well forcing the issue to be discussed at the AGM, she and other members of the campaign will protest outside the meeting in Birmingham."It's a shame they won't come and talk to us," she says.The bank is urging shareholders not to vote for the resolution, arguing that the practice is legal and that it was sent a statement by the pensions minister in November 2017 confirming that the government does not support withdrawal of the policy.The resolution needs the backing of 75% of investors and one of the influential bodies which advises major shareholders, ISS, is recommending voting against.But requisitioning the vote at the AGM has given the long-running campaign a new voice.Last year, a scheme member told BBC Radio 4's Money Box how just over 1,800 of her 6,400 a year pension - a third - was affected.Lower paid women Ms McGeough-Adams said: "HSBC needs to urgently end the injustice of its clawback policy which is causing many people to have to choose between food or fuel in their retirement."Her reduction takes place in a few years' time - she is 61 - and she left the bank in 2012 after working her way up to manage two branches in Stoke-on-Trent on a salary of 23,000 a year.The pension scheme was a non-contributory pension final scheme and staff were eligible to join between 31 December 1974 and 1 July 1996.Until June 2009, it was a final salary, non-contributory scheme and taken on by HSBC after it took over Midland Bank in the early 1990s.When members reach state retirement age, the bank says it adjusts payouts from the scheme so that the total sum received by the pensioner is "broadly maintained".The campaigners call the practice "clawback" - the bank calls it "state deduction" - and argue it was not properly described to them.They argue that it "penalises the lowest paid, creating financial hardship" and "indirect discrimination" as the majority of lower-paid staff are women.HSBC said the scheme is not "unfair, disproportionate or discriminatory" and argues that describing it as "clawback" is not justified.John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant, said the "rules are being followed" and the idea behind such a practice was to smooth out pensions between company retirement, at say 60, and state pension age.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption HSBC calculates it would cost 450m to stop the state-deductions.Campaigners say other firms have ended the practice and also argue it was used to explain why they were paid less than new recruits."We were told it was worth it's weight in gold," said McGeough-Adams.It is a story echoed by Denise, who does not want to give her surname, who said that when she discovered her salary was less than a new colleague's, she was told it was because she had a non-contributory pension scheme.'Fighting back' She later discovered her payments would be reduced when she received her state pension."They called it non-contributory but I felt I had a made a contribution," said Denise, who worked at the bank for more than 40 years.MPs have lent their support, including Clive Betts, the MP for Sheffield South East, who in a video issued by the campaigners said: "HSBC is depriving long-term and loyal former employees of the pensions they have worked so hard to earn".Campaigners say that the amount clawed back is calculated on the number of years they worked at the bank, not their salary or seniority, so it affects the lower paid most.And they were more likely to be women.The Equality and Human Rights Commission has written to HSBC to ask for further information after being contacted by MPs and says that the scheme "could put women at a particular disadvantage compared to men as they are more likely to have been on lower salaries"."The rising costs of pensions led many providers to change their schemes.However, these should be justified as being a proportionate way to achieve a legitimate objective," the EHRC said.Shirley Eidman, another founder of the campaign, says the group feels it needs to take a stand through the AGM."We're fighting back, whether we get anywhere is a another thing," she said.
MP lodges bill to 'boost status' of Scottish banknotes in UK:::::An MP has lodged a bill at Westminster calling for Scottish banknotes to be accepted throughout the UK.Scottish banknotes are legal currency throughout the UK, but technically do not qualify as "legal tender".Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael said that "every Scot who travels south has a story about their money being turned down or looked at sceptically".He wants to change the law to "oblige businesses and companies to accept Scottish banknotes as payment".The move comes after tennis coach Judy Murray tweeted about a Scottish note being refused at a London bakery.Skip Twitter post by @JudyMurray When you go to pay 9 for 2 donuts (yes, really) in London and your 10 Bank of Scotland note is refused because we only take British ones.pic.twitter.com/SCCzIfolDn judy murray (@JudyMurray) April 8, 2019 Report There are strict rules governing what is "legal tender" - a phrase which has a narrow technical definition in relation to the settlement of a debt, and which the Bank of England says "has very little practical application" in everyday transactions.No banknotes are classed as legal tender in Scotland, while notes issued by Scottish banks are legal currency but not legal tender south of the border.Mr Carmichael's Legal Tender (Scottish Banknotes) Bill would stress that no distinction could be drawn between Scottish banknotes and those from other banks as forms of payment.The former Scottish Secretary said: "There is no reason to make a distinction between Scottish and other banknotes as acceptable payment.It's beyond time we give legal force to the well-known phrase 'that's legal tender, pal'."I hope that this bill will encourage businesses across the UK to recognise and accept Scottish currency."A similar bill was put forward by current Scottish Secretary David Mundell when he was an opposition MP in 2009.His Scottish Banknotes (Acceptability in United Kingdom) Bill had a first reading in the Commons, but made no further progress and never became law.
Murdoch wins preliminary backing to merge his Times titles:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rupert Murdoch bought the Times titles in 1981 Rupert Murdoch's Times and the Sunday Times should be free to merge editorial departments, the government has ruled.Culture secretary Jeremy Wright said he was "minded" to allow News UK's request that the two newspapers should be allowed to share journalism resources.When the papers were bought in 1981 Mr Murdoch gave legal undertakings to keep them separate.But News UK has argued that the competitive landscape has changed, especially in the digital era.The papers employ 505 people between them.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport will now take more evidence before a final verdict.Mr Wright said in a statement: "I am... minded to accept News UK's application.However, in considering the proposed new undertakings as a whole, I have noted that the existing governance arrangements - agreed in 1981 - lack clarity and certainty over roles and responsibilities."Before agreeing the application I am therefore of the view that these arrangements need to be suitably updated and enhanced to reflect corporate best practice."News UK has said the change would allow more flexibility to share resources across the titles, while continuing to commit to them remaining as separate newspapers with separate editors.In its application, News UK had listed a number of factors affecting the industry, including the fall in circulation as readers shift online.At the time, it said that "virtually all" other major UK national appeared to have integrated their editions.News UK welcomed Mr Wright's announcement and his acknowledgement that "a material change of circumstances" since 1981 justified merging the newspapers' resources."The Times and The Sunday Times are committed to remaining as separate newspapers but persistent cost pressures facing our industry means both titles need the freedom and ability to work more closely to avoid unnecessary duplication.We are now engaging with the DCMS on any further relevant updates," a spokesperson for News UK said.

Brexit: How the new delay has hit four businesses:::::Image copyright Elizabeth McKenna Image caption Elizabeth McKenna's flower business relies on overnight shipments from Holland It was an early-hour announcement that allowed many of the UK's business owners to finally get a few hours of restful sleep.In Brussels on Thursday, the EU granted the UK a six-month extension, thus eliminating the immediate threat of a no-deal Brexit.But for companies that have been preparing for a sudden exit, it was no more than a temporary reprieve."It's a bit of uncertainty that isn't helpful," says Andrew Graham.His 70-year-old company, Graham and Brown Wallpaper, has been stockpiling raw materials for months at its factory in Blackburn."Quite frankly, we could do with knowing where we're going," he told the BBC.Image caption Andrew Graham's wallpaper company had been stockpiling supplies "An extension is better than a no deal, but actually we could do with getting the withdrawal deal through so that business can then plan for what it needs to do."'Not insurmountable' Joy Parkinson, who runs a Bury-based company selling natural beauty products, is more sanguine.The Faith in Nature boss says Brexit is a hurdle, "but not insurmountable"."We've been buying additional stock of the lovely fragrances we buy in from Europe, to make sure we were covered if there were issues around ports and blockages," she says."We were anticipating that some of our partners in European markets might have wanted to buy extra stock," Ms Parkinson explains, but that scenario never materialised."We've not overbought, so we've been fairly sensible and fairly pragmatic, we've not bought six months, 12 months of additional material, so we've managed the cash flow fairly pragmatically."Image copyright Sloane's Image caption Waitrose supplier Sloane's had to absorb a rise in the cost of chocolate Nottingham florist and former Apprentice contestant Elizabeth McKenna has felt the impact of Brexit uncertainty much more strongly.Her business, and her industry, are part of a finely tuned supply chain."We order and buy our flowers from Holland online," she explains.Orders need to be confirmed by 10:00 so as to meet auction deadlines in the Netherlands.The flowers are then transported overnight via rail and ferries, and any delay could mean they arrive wilted or dead.The initial Brexit date of 29 March, Ms McKenna explains, was just two days before her company's busiest day of the year - Mother's Day.Image copyright Faith In Nature Image caption Cosmetics firm Faith In Nature expected its European customers to stock up in advance of Brexit "That actually created an increase in commodity prices, because of the uncertainty with the exchange rate during that week which has directly affected profits within my industry."As far as trying to plan for what is going to happen with Brexit, we are a small industry... and we haven't had enough information to plan.""Literally all that florists and people working at my level can do, as small independent businesses with 10 people, is wait and see what the government tells us."Ms McKenna says small business have only received one or two Brexit-related letters from the likes of HMRC, "We're essentially just saving money, cutting our costs where we can and are waiting to weather whatever is to come."Other business have already had to absorb large additional costs.Sloane's Hot Chocolate is made in a studio in Surrey - but sold in Waitrose, Harrods, and overseas to the US, Canada, Singapore, Dubai and Ireland.It's one of many small businesses for which a further Brexit extension isn't merely a waiting period, but comes at a significant price.Founder Brian Watt says the company's suffering began the day after the referendum in 2016, when the pound dropped sharply against the dollar.This led to a 20% increase in the cost of its main ingredient - chocolate.The company chose not to pass that on to customers, instead eating into its profit margins.Then, with a no-deal looming, Sloane's was told by one supplier that the price of their product would go up by 20% or 30%, forcing Mr Watt to stockpile."Whereas we would normally hold maybe one to two weeks supply of those items, we are now holding one to two months," he told the BBC, "because we would find it very difficult to pass on 20 to 30% price increases to our customers."To help with the upfront costs of buying up supplies such as packaging, Sloane's had to secure a large overdraft from a bank.But Mr Watt is stoic in the face of many more months of uncertainty."We basically made the decision that we are just going to get on with running our business," he says.
How does it feel to be watched at work all the time?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There is a wrong and right way to carry out workplace surveillance Is workplace surveillance about improving productivity or simply a way to control staff and weed out poor performers?Courtney Hagen Ford, 34, left her job working as a bank teller because she found the surveillance she was under was "dehumanising".Her employer logged her keystrokes and used software to monitor how many of the customers she helped went on to take out loans and fee-paying accounts."The sales pressure was relentless," she recalls."The totality was horrible."She decided selling fast food would be better, but ironically, left the bank to do a doctorate in surveillance technology.Courtney is not alone in her dislike of this kind of surveillance, but it's on the rise around the world as firms look to squeeze more productivity from their workers and become more efficient.Image copyright Courtney Hagen Ford Image caption Courtney Hagen Ford says having her every move monitored was "dehumanising" More than half of companies with over $750m (574m) in annual revenue used "non-traditional" monitoring techniques on staff last year, says Brian Kropp, vice-president of research firm Gartner.These include tools to analyse e-mails, conversations, computer usage, and employee movements around the office.Some firms are also monitoring heart rates and sleep patterns to see how these affect performance.In 2015, 30% used such tools.Next year, Mr Kropp expects 80% will.And workforce analytics will be a $1.87bn industry by 2025, says San Francisco's Grand Review Research.So why is business so keen?Ben Waber, chief executive of Humanyze, a Boston workplace analytics company, says it gives firms the ability to assess how their staff are performing and interacting, which can be good for the firm but also good for employees themselves.Image copyright Robin Lubbock Image caption Humanyze's Ben Waber thinks firms need to find our more about how they function His company gathers "data exhaust" left by employees' email and instant messaging apps, and uses name badges equipped with radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices and microphones.These can check how much time you spend talking, your volume and tone of voice, even if you dominate conversations.While this may sound intrusive - not to say creepy - proponents argue that it can also protect employees against bullying and sexual harassment.Humanyze calls these badges "Fitbit for your career".Some of this data analysis can produce unexpected results, says Mr Waber.For example, one large tech client discovered that coders who sat at 12-person lunch tables tended to outperform those who regularly sat at four-person tables.The larger tables led to more interaction with staff from other parts of the company, he says, and this improved idea sharing.Larger lunch tables were "driving more than a 10% difference in performances".A fact that would probably have gone undetected without such data analysis.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The chip allows employees to open doors and use the photocopier without a traditional pass card Over the last few years a Stockholm co-working space called Epicenter has gone much further and holds popular "chipping parties", where people can have RFID-enabled rice-sized microchips implanted in their hands.They can use the implants to access electronically controlled doors, swap contacts, or monitor how typing speed correlates with heart rate, says Epicenter's Hannes Sjblad, who has an implant himself.The implant "cannot transmit any data unless you put it within a centimetre of a reader, so the person with the implant controls when it can be read", he says.Embedded chips may seem extreme, but it is a relatively small step from ID cards and biometrics to such devices, says Prof Jeffrey Stanton, a University of Syracuse academic who researches work-related stress.As long as such schemes are voluntary, "there will probably be a growing number of convenience-oriented uses such that a substantial number of workers would opt to have a chip implanted", he believes.But if embedded chips are used to reduce slack time or rest breaks, "we are probably in the bad zone", he says.And if surveillance tools "take away autonomy", that's when they prove most unpopular.Image copyright Gartner Image caption Gartner's Brian Kropp says bad communication can scupper monitoring projects A lot depends on how such monitoring initiatives are communicated, Gartner's Mr Kropp argues.In 2016, Britain's Telegraph newspaper installed heat and motion monitoring devices under employees' desks.While management said it was to find out which desks were occupied for energy management purposes, staff thought they were been spied on and staged a revolt.The devices were removed after 24 hours.If bosses don't communicate effectively, employees assume the worst, Mr Kropp says.But if they're open about the information they're collecting - and what they're doing with it - 46% of employees are "generally okay with it".Although many such monitoring schemes use anonymised data and participation is voluntary, many staff remain sceptical and fear an erosion of their civil liberties.In less liberal countries, workers are not given any choice at all.But for some, the benefits are obvious.Image copyright Jessica Johnson Image caption Jessica Johnson says her workplace tracking software helps her cope with narcolepsy "I've got a condition called narcolepsy," explains Jessica Johnson, 34, from Canberra, Australia.She falls asleep for short periods during the day, then is disorientated when she wakes.This "impacts my memory, my ability to focus and concentrate," she says.She worked with an insurance company where employees used a programme called Timely to track billable hours.It helped her quickly find what she had been doing before she fell asleep, and pick up where she left off."You install it on your phone, and then on your computer, and that's how you get all the raw data," says Mathias Mikkelsen, Timely's Norwegian chief executive.More Technology of Business "Machine learning algorithms analyse all the data, and create beautiful charts," he says.You can then see how much time you're wasting in unproductive meetings, say, or replying to e-mails.You could show managers you were "spending so much time on stuff that's not what you were hired to do," says Mr Mikkelsen.So workplace surveillance could be empowering for staff and useful for companies looking to become more efficient and profitable.But implemented in the wrong way, it could also become an unpopular tool of oppression that proves counterproductive.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
The estate where neighbours began to ‘vanish’:::::Image caption Families joined forces to protest outside a different, unaffected Taylor Wimpey development It took seven families two years, but a group of homeowners in Scotland has taken on a housing giant in order to have their "crumbling" new-build homes repaired.It's part of a broader, UK-wide issue - this is their story.Sheila Chalmers moved to her estate in Peebles in the Scottish borders with her husband 10 years ago.Her four-bed home was one of 250 built by developer Taylor Wimpey on a new site.For eight years, life went on as normal.Then something strange started to happen.Overnight, families at the top end of the estate started to vanish.But there were no for sale signs and no-one new was moving in."It became almost a ghost street," she says."Houses were empty.People were disappearing."Sheila later heard that the properties had been bought back by Taylor Wimpey after problems were discovered.The owners had signed non-disclosure agreements so they could not speak out.Image caption Sheila paid for assessments by two different structural engineers Taylor Wimpey confirmed it did buy back a "small number of homes" to start with.It later sent a letter to all the remaining residents, saying that some houses did have a problem with the mortar holding together their bricks.Sheila thought she did not have anything to worry about, but she went outside and checked anyway.Patches of mortar were clearly eroding, she says, and in other places it could be scraped out with a fingernail.She paid for assessments by two different structural engineers, who both said the house needed extensive repair work, though Taylor Wimpey said its own inspections found that was not the case.Mortar is made up of two key materials: cement and sand.The more cement in the mix, the stronger the mortar, though the more brittle it can be.The family paid to have their laboratory tests on the mortar carried out by a specialist firm.The results suggested that there was far more sand in the mix than you would expect for a home in that area, although Taylor Wimpey says the type of chemical test used was "not appropriate" and the results could not be relied upon.Our investigation in 2018 found similar complaints about weak mortar across at least 13 estates in the UK all built by different companies.Image caption Jill and Pete Hall say they would never buy a new build house again Three doors down from Sheila, live Pete and Jill Hall with their 13-year-old son.Like Sheila, they first learned about the problem two years ago when Taylor Wimpey were buying back the individual houses.They paid for their own tests, which showed only one in eight samples taken from their home met industry guidelines, although again Taylor Wimpey says the test used was "not appropriate"."On the garage the tests came back showing it was just sand," said Pete.A video filmed by the family after a rainstorm clearly shows the mortar on the back wall falling out when a screwdriver was run gently along it.Handmade signs In the end, seven core households became involved - passing on details to a wider community group on the estate.The families worked together to build their case, paying for their own structural surveys and using Freedom of Information laws to demand internal documents from the local council.They made handmade signs and protested outside the showroom of another Taylor Wimpey estate in the area.In 2017, they presented their findings to Taylor Wimpey's lawyers, saying that they would go public if their properties were not fixed, demolished or bought back.They were surprised at the response.The families' solicitors received a letter back saying they had decided not to report the group to the authorities under the Proceeds of Crime legislation."It was accusing us of bribery, effectively," said Pete."It took me about 10 minutes to stop laughing.But it was intimidation, a threat."Image caption The couple bought a giant shipping container, covered it with warning stickers and left it on their front lawn By then, Pete and Jill had hired their own engineers to examine the house.They recommended that the couple should stop using the garage because it was at risk of collapse, although Taylor Wimpey denies that there was a structural problem.The couple bought a giant shipping container, covered it with warning stickers and left it on their front lawn.That, they say, got Taylor Wimpey's attention and - two years down the line - an agreement has now been reached for their home to be fixed."It falls short of where we think a full repair should be, but they have said it's that or nothing - so we have accepted it," Jill says.'Someone has to stand up' In December 2018, Taylor Wimpey sent out letters saying all 130 houses in the estate built with the weaker mortar would now be offered "remediation" work.Properties are being dealt with one at a time.Construction crews are scraping out the old mortar and replacing it with a stronger material.Taylor Wimpey said it "sincerely apologises" to the all the homeowners affected, is "fully committed to resolving matters" and has "a clear plan in place to remediate affected homes"."This is a localised issue and falls short of the high-quality standards we uphold," it said.The firm has now apologised to Sheila and, even though its own inspections found a full repair is not needed, said work to replace the mortar in her home will start this summer.It will refund some of the 16,000 she has spent on legal costs and technical reports, most of which she had to borrow.Repair work on Pete and Jill's property, which may involve the demolition of the garage, is due to start in mid-July.Both families say the fight has been time-consuming, stressful and put them off ever buying a new-build home again."These developers, these companies, cannot be allowed to continue the destruction of people's lives with building shoddy homes," said Sheila."Somebody has to stand up and show them that they cannot get away with it."What went wrong?Maps drawn up by Taylor Wimpey show about half of the 250 homes were built with far weaker mortar than recommended under industry standards A memo sent to all developers in the UK by the National House Building Council (NHBC) in 2013 warned about this problem The local council in Peebles says the mortar used was not the type in the original building warrant and was changed later without its knowledge Taylor Wimpey says the material was "of sufficient strength to meet structural requirements" as "supported by an independent review" by the local council, but accepts it may be "less durable under prevailing exposure conditions" It says it has now offered to repoint "any home which was constructed with the same mortar, regardless of whether our inspection found this was necessary or not" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter -

Why India is one of world's most protectionist countries:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launches the "Make In India" project The world's largest democratic exercise begins today.Nine hundred million Indians are registered to vote in general elections taking place over the next five weeks.Much is at stake.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised to make India the world's third largest economy by 2030.Meanwhile, the opposition Congress Party has put job creation at the heart of its manifesto.India's trade policy has also come under scrutiny.With some of the highest tariffs in the world, some fear the country is slipping back into its old protectionist ways.A history of protectionism After independence in 1947, India spent decades trying to survive without international trade.The country ditched its model of local production for local consumption following a currency crisis in the early 1990s that forced policymakers to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help.The IMF cash came with conditions: India had to open up to foreign investment, cut red tape and remove trade barriers.Many saw this as the start of India's reintegration into the global economy, and over the last 20 years liberalisation has connected its young, vibrant workforce with firms around the world.Today, it is one of the world's top outsourcing destinations, with many of its workers powering back-end IT systems, call centres and software development.This has also helped India to run a trade surplus - whereby it sells more than it buys - in goods and services with the US.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Indian workers answer telephone calls at a call-centre in New Delhi The Modi era When Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, he promised to boost India's already impressive growth through further economic liberalisation.And the new government took big steps to make doing business easier, says Rick Rossow, former deputy director at the US-India business council.For example, it combined more than a dozen levies into one national sales tax that helped goods to move seamlessly across state borders.Mr Modi's warmth with global leaders and chief executives - and his oft-lampooned fondness for hugging them - also marked a big shift from past prime ministers.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Modi has sought closer relationships with global chief executives such as Mark Zuckerberg Yet when it comes to its trade, there has been no such progress, with some even accusing the country of travelling backwards.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Indian duties on Harley Davidson motorcycles and American whiskey, despite trade between the two countries having boomed in recent years.In its latest report on global trade barriers, the US trade department singles out India as having the highest tariffs "of any major world economy" - averaging 13.8%.It describes Indian trade policy as opaque, unpredictable, and says it often leaves US firms drowning in paperwork.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Mr Rossow says India's strategy has always been "pro-investment and anti-trade".Flagship government policies such as Make in India have aggressively courted foreign direct investment while seeking to boost domestic manufacturing.To achieve this, India has erected trade barriers against competitors.In the past, western multinationals were the target.Today, China is seen as a rising threat.The BJP used its budget last year to raise import duties on goods including sunglasses, cigarette lighters and fruit juice to discourage Chinese imports.'WTO troublemaker' Mr Modi's government has also spent the last four years defending India's multibillion-dollar food-security programme, which many developed countries see as unfair.Under the programme, the government heavily subsidises local farmers so they can provide low cost food for the poor.But, the US and others argue it breaks World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules around subsidy limits.Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former Australian negotiator at the WTO, thinks they may have a point."India is justifying its agricultural subsidies by claiming their poorest citizens can't afford food, but they're maintaining massive tariff walls that effectively prevent the imports that could bring prices down."Blocking progress?He believes Mr Modi is just grandstanding to show support for the millions of farmers in India - a key voting constituency.This also may explain why India has become such a troublemaker at the WTO over the issue, Mr Grozoubinski adds.Indian trade representatives regularly use obscure legal precedents to stop the Geneva-based body from doing its job, he says, even trying to block rulings on entirely unrelated matters."Domestically it plays well for them to say we're standing up for poor farmers and not letting western countries bully us," he adds.Trade flows and trade talks As the fastest growing major economy in the world, India is unlikely to worry too much about such criticism.It's managed to bring millions of people out of poverty since the millennium, although challenges remain.There is, however, a risk that its protectionism could backfire.Take the way that, last December, the government banned foreign retailers such as Amazon from striking exclusive deals with local goods sellers.The move was viewed as a bid by Mr Modi to placate small traders, also a key voter base.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Would Rahul Gandhi, head of the rival Congress party, change trade policy?But it irked the US and last month the Trump administration said it planned to end a scheme which allows some goods to enter the US duty-free after India refused to remove price caps on some medical devices.India, which was also angered by Washington's refusal to exempt India from steel and aluminium tariffs last year, vowed to retaliate.But it has so far delayed implementing tit-for-tat tariffs."My guess is that they see picking a direct fight with the US as a losing battle and a real danger," Mr Rossow says.Will the election change anything?Trade is unlikely to play a major role in this year's election.Voters are more likely to be concerned about jobs and growth, says Shumita Deveshwar, director of India research at TS Lombard.Others compare Indian protectionism to the "slippery slope" in President Trump's America, where strong growth is overshadowed by a fear of China and a lack of good jobs.Analysts say the risk is that further protectionist measures could reverse the economic gains enjoyed by the country since liberalisation.Ms Deveshwar says India will need to reform on trade if it wants to secure long-term prosperity."India hasn't been able to tap into some of the trade opportunities that have opened up because of the tensions between the US and China, and you've seen other countries such as Vietnam come and take that market share."If the Congress party gains power in May, it is unclear whether it will seek to change India's trade policy, and Mr Rossow believes a second term for Mr Modi will just mean more of the same."This government is all about trying to encourage investment and if it continues [in power], you're going to see another big run at that."The Indian government did not respond to requests for comment on the issues raised in this article.
Cricket World Cup is about 'participation not profit':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Indian cricket star Virat Koli (blue) is one of the big names taking part in the World Cup Twenty years ago Steve Elworthy was part of a talented South African cricket team that crashed out of a World Cup semi-final in the most dramatic fashion possible.As the game reached its climax, the team known as The Proteas needed just one run from four balls to reach the tournament final against Pakistan at Lord's.But, on the verge of glory, batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald contrived to get the latter run out in a shambolically exciting end to the game.Two decades on, 54-year-old Elworthy is now the person in charge of staging this year's International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup in England and Wales.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption South Africa's Steve Elworthy (green) is run out in the 1999 World Cup semi-final And with 50 days until the tournament begins, he says he would welcome such memorable drama at this year's event, even though the pain of that game at Edgbaston, Birmingham, still remains."I can still remember it as though it was yesterday," he says."I was in the changing room, in my pads, having been run out myself not long before, when I saw it all unfold on a TV in the changing rooms.Image caption Former cricketer Steve Elworthy is now an experienced sporting administrator "The whole thing happened in slow motion.We couldn't believe what we were seeing."The changing room was deadly afterwards.There was complete silence for 30 to 40 minutes before we started to gather ourselves.Yet we still got a hero's welcome when we returned to South Africa, despite what had happened."Global TV deals While the drama, and climactic endings, of one-day cricket remains - just look at the 2017 Women's World Cup final that England won by just nine runs - much has changed in the wider world since the 1999 men's tournament.Elworthy has now organised half a dozen global cricketing events for the ICC, and is putting the finishing touches to this year's World Cup.Lasting for six weeks, it will feature stars such as India's Virat Koli, England's Joe Root, and the West Indies' Chris Gayle.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Cricket World Cup trophy has been on a global tour to increase awareness of the event And while this year's event may not make money, Elworthy, says that - given the publicity that will come from wide-ranging global TV deals and over-subscribed ticket sales - making a profit is not the over-riding objective.Rather it is about ensuring cricket remains on the 21st Century sporting and leisure map, at a time when football dominates the back pages, and the power of digital communications means there are competing attractions for people's free time."This will be my sixth ICC tournament," says Elworthy, managing director of the 2019 World Cup."They have tended to be short-sharp tournaments with not a lot of legacy, which is something we want to address this year."He heads up a team of 100 people, based at Lord's Cricket Ground, working to deliver the ICC's global event on behalf of the hosts, the England and Wales Cricket Board.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Getting more children to play cricket is a top priority "When we started to plan for this year back in 2014 we realised there was an opportunity for this Cricket World Cup to get more people to play the game," he says."That became the priority for the event hosts, the ECB, and tournament organisers, the ICC.Clearly there are financial benefits, although it is not our priority," he points out.Sharing the spoils He says the event will have a global TV audience of 1.5 billion viewers.There have also been more than three million applicants for just over 650,000 tickets.The ICC keeps broadcast and sponsor revenues, and the ECB keeps publications and ticket revenues - but has pledged to put the money back into the game - to schools and clubs, and into the tournament itself.Meanwhile, the match venues keep hospitality, food, drink, and car parking revenues.The match venues can use that cash to update facilities, such as investing in changing rooms and new floodlights.Image copyright CWC19 Image caption World Cup ticket numbers have been vastly oversubscribed "We want to engage one million under-16s through the Cricket World Cup," says Elworthy."It is a hugely ambitious number.We want to really stretch the ICC and ECB to achieve that number."We want to get 100,000 young people to watch a World Cup game, and have priced tickets for them at 6 a time."That for me is the main legacy... how to engage with new cricket audiences, and get people to play the games in schools and elsewhere, as well as to watch it."A volunteer programme, along the lines of that successfully used in London 2012 Olympics and Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, was heavily oversubscribed.The World Cup will also be used to publicise the ECB's All Stars Cricket programme, aimed at giving children aged five to eight a first experience in cricket.'Fantastic format' There has been much debate around the tournament format, which instead of a number of groups, features one large group, with each of the 10 teams playing each other once, before two semi finals and a final."The 1992 World Cup, where there was a round-robin format, was heralded as one of the better ones," says Elworthy."I think all-playing-all is the best format.Every supporter knows where their team is going to play and when.If you have different pools you have uncertainty and fans buying tickets 'on spec' for future games they might not qualify for.The round-robin format has been terrific for us in terms of ticket sales.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Australia are the reigning World Cup champions after defeating New Zealand in 2015 "Every team is guaranteed nine games.You could have a bad result and your prospects change, and suddenly you have to perform to get into the top four and a semi-final place.Or you could have a good few result, and the semi-final is a possibility again."'Upsets and dramas' With such a demand for tickets and only a finite amount available, that plays into the hands of touts."We are doing what we can about it within the confines of the law," says Elworthy."We are very pro-active in this areas.We have our own ticket resale platform in place."He said if organisers were able to identify the seat row and number of tickets appearing on non-sanctioned secondary websites, then they would cancel them.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption England and South Africa open the 2019 World Cup at the Oval on 30 May "There is a very real danger you will not be able to get into games," he warns."We priced tickets at a certain level for a reason, with the lowest price being 16.We want the tournament to be accessible."We want to attract families, with fan zones and lots of interactive and participatory events around games."Looking back to 1999 does he believe there will be anything to compare to that semi final, when South Africa and Australia actually tied the match, but the latter went through after finishing higher in their earlier Super Six table?"There are bound to be upsets and drama," he says."The different playing conditions from the north to the south of the country will play a part too."
How to solve the plastic packaging paradox:::::Image copyright Getty Images Today, plastic packaging has a bad (w)rap.But the first commercially viable version of the now ubiquitous material - cellophane - was conceived in a more innocent age, before anyone worried about plastic in landfill, or the sea, or the food chain.It begins in 1904, at an upmarket restaurant in Vosges, France, when an elderly patron spilled red wine over a pristine linen tablecloth.Sitting at a nearby table was a Swiss chemist called Jacques Brandenberger, who worked for a French textile company.As he watched the waiter change the tablecloth, he wondered about designing a fabric that would simply wipe clean.He tried spraying cellulose on tablecloths but it peeled off in transparent sheets.But might those transparent sheets have a market?Find out more 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.By World War One, he'd found one: eye-pieces for gas masks.He called his invention "cellophane" and in 1923 he sold the rights to the DuPont corporation in America.Its early uses there included wrapping chocolates, perfume and flowers.But DuPont had a problem.Some customers weren't happy.They'd been told cellophane was waterproof, and it was, but it wasn't moisture-proof.Candies stuck to it; knives rusted in it; cigars dried out.DuPont hired a 27-year-old chemist, William Hale Charch, and tasked him with finding a solution.Image copyright Getty Images Within a year, he'd done it - the cellophane was coated with extremely thin layers of nitrocellulose, wax, a plasticiser and a blending agent.Sales took off.The timing was perfect.In the 1930s, supermarkets were changing - customers no longer queued to tell shop assistants what food they required.They picked products off the shelves instead.See-through packaging was a hit.And, as Harvard Business School researcher Ai Hisano points out, had "a significant impact not only on how consumers purchased foods but also on how they understood food quality".Cellophane let them choose food on the basis of how it looked, without sacrificing hygiene or freshness.Image copyright Getty Images One study - admittedly funded by DuPont - found that wrapping crackers in cellophane boosted sales by more than half.And retailers had no shortage of similar advice."She buys meat with her eyes," said a 1938 edition of The Progressive Grocer.In fact, the meat counter was the hardest to make self-service.The problem was that meat, once cut, would quickly discolour.But trials suggested a self-service meat counter could sell 30% more food.With such an incentive, solutions were found: pink-tinted lighting, antioxidant additives and - of course - an improved version of cellophane, which let through just the right amount of oxygen.Image copyright Getty Images By 1949, DuPont adverts boasted about the "pleasing new way" to buy meat - "pre-cut, weighed, priced and wrapped in cellophane right in the store".But cellophane would soon fall out of fashion, overtaken by the likes of Dow Chemical's polyvinylidene chloride.Like its predecessor, this was an accidental discovery first used in conflict - in this case, weatherproofing fighter planes in World War Two.And, like cellophane, it needed plenty of research and development before it could be used on food - it was originally dark green and smelled disgusting.Once Dow sorted that out, it hit the market as Saran Wrap - now more widely known as cling film.More things that made the modern economy: After health scares with polyvinylidene chloride, cling film is now often made with low-density polyethylene, though that's less, well, clingy.It's also used to make those single-use supermarket bags now being banned around the world.High-density polyethylene is the kind of stuff you might get milk in.Image copyright Getty Images Fizzy drinks come in polyethylene terephthalate.And if you're not lost already, consider that plastic packaging is increasingly made from multiple layers of these and other substances, such as biaxially-oriented polypropylene or ethylene-vinyl acetate.There's a reason for this, say packaging gurus - different materials have different properties, so multiple layers can give you the same performance from a thinner - and thus lighter - piece of packaging.But these compound packaging materials are harder to recycle.The trade-off is hard to fathom.Depending on how much of the heavier, recyclable packaging would in practice be recycled, you might find that the lighter, non-recyclable packaging actually generates less waste.And once you start looking into plastic packaging, this kind of counterintuitive conclusion comes up all the time.Some packaging is a foolish waste.But are shrink-wrapped cucumbers really so silly if it means they stay fresh for 14 days rather than three?Image copyright Getty Images Which is worse 1.5g (0.05oz) of plastic wrap or entire cucumbers going off before being eaten?Suddenly it's not so obvious.Plastic bags stop bananas going brown so quickly, or new potatoes going green; they catch grapes that fall off bunches.About a decade ago, one UK supermarket experimented with taking all its fruit and vegetables out of their packaging - and its food wastage rate doubled.And it's not just shelf life - what about waste created before food gets to the shop in the first place?Another supermarket, stung by criticism for putting apples in plastic-wrapped trays, tried selling them loose from big cardboard boxes - but so many were damaged in transit that the approach used more packaging per apple actually sold.Image copyright Getty Images According to a UK government report, only 3% of food is wasted before it gets to shops.In developing countries, that figure can be 50% - and that difference is partly due to how the food is packaged.As more of us live in cities, far from where food is grown, this matters.Even the dreaded single-use shopping bag might not be the villain it seems.If you've bought sturdy, reusable bags from your supermarket, it's likely they're made from non-woven polypropylene - and they are less damaging, but only if you use them at least 52 times.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anya Hindmarch's I'm not a plastic bag design was meant to discourage single-use plastic bags That's according to a report by the Danish government, which weighed up the varied environmental impacts of producing and disposing of different kinds of bag.And if your reusable bag is organic cotton, don't feel smug - the researchers reckon they need 20,000 uses to justify themselves.That's a shopping trip every day for over half a century.The market can be a wonderful way of signalling popular desires.Shoppers in 1940s America wanted convenient, pre-cut meat - and what economists call the "invisible hand" of the market delivered the technologies that made it possible.But our desire for less waste may not yield to market forces, because the issue is complicated and our choices at the checkout may accidentally do more harm than good.Image copyright Getty Images We can send that message on a more circuitous route only, through governments and pressure groups, and hope that they - and well-meaning industry initiatives - will work out some sensible answers.It seems clear the solution will not be no packaging - it will be better packaging, dreamed up in research and development labs of the kind that gave us moisture-proof cellophane all those decades ago.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Should cyber-security be more chameleon, less rhino?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Do we need to rethink our approach to cybersecurity?Billions are being lost to cyber-crime each year, and the problem seems to be getting worse.So could we ever create unhackable computers beyond the reach of criminals and spies?Israeli researchers are coming up with some interesting solutions.The key to stopping the hackers, explains Neatsun Ziv, vice president of cyber-security products at Tel Aviv-based Check Point Security Technologies, is to make hacking unprofitable."We're currently tracking 150 hacking groups a week, and they're making $100,000 a week each," he tells the BBC."If we raise the bar, they lose money.They don't want to lose money."This means making it difficult enough for hackers to break in that they choose easier targets.And this has been the main principle governing the cyber-security industry ever since it was invented - surrounding businesses with enough armour plating to make it too time-consuming for hackers to drill through.The rhinoceros approach, you might call it.But some think the industry needs to be less rhinoceros and more chameleon, camouflaging itself against attack."We need to bring prevention back into the game," says Yuval Danieli, vice president of customer services at Israeli cyber-security firm Morphisec."Most of the world is busy with detection and remediation - threat hunting - instead of preventing the cyber-attack before it occurs."Morphisec - born out of research done at Ben-Gurion University - has developed what it calls "moving target security".It's a way of scrambling the names, locations and references of each file and software application in a computer's memory to make it harder for malware to get its teeth stuck in to your system.The mutation occurs each time the computer is turned on so the system is never configured the same way twice.The firm's tech is used to protect the London Stock Exchange and Japanese industrial robotics firm Yaskawa, as well as bank and hotel chains.But the most effective way to secure a computer is to isolate it from local networks and the internet completely - so-called air gapping.You would need to gain physical access to the computer to steal data.Image copyright Ben-Gurion University Image caption Yuval Elovici believes that no way of protecting a computer is 100% reliable Yuval Elovici, head of the cyber-security research centre at Ben-Gurion University, warns that even this method isn't 100% reliable."The obvious way to attack an air-gapped machine is to compromise it during the supply chain when it is being built," he says."So you then have a compromised air-gapped computer in a nuclear power station that came with the malware - the attacker never has to enter the premises."Indeed, in October last year, Bloomberg Businessweek alleged that Chinese spies had managed to insert chips on servers made in China that could be activated once the machines were plugged in overseas.The servers were manufactured for US firm Super Micro Computer Inc.The story suggested that Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Apple were among 30 companies, as well as government agencies and departments, that had used the suspect servers.Apple and Amazon strenuously denied the claims.More Technology of Business While air gapping is impractical for many businesses, so-called "co-operative cyber-security" is being seen as another way to thwart the hackers.Imagine there are four firms working together: Barclays, Microsoft, Google and a cyber-security company, say.Each of the four firms gives a piece of data to each other.They don't know what the data is that they are protecting, but they hold it in their networks.In order to access sensitive information from any of the firms, attackers would need to hack all four networks and work out which piece of data is missing, to be able to make any sense of the files stolen."If the likelihood of breaking into a single network is 1%, then to penetrate four different networks, the likelihood would become 0.000001%," explains Alon Cohen, founder of cyber-security firm nsKnox and former chief technology officer for the Israeli military.Image copyright Check Point Image caption Check Point's Neatsun Ziv believes "there's no such thing as an unhackable computer" He calls the concept "crypto-splitting", and it involves encoding each sequence of data as thousands of numbers then dividing these cryptographic puzzles between the four companies."You would need to solve thousands of puzzles in order to put the data back together," says Mr Cohen.Check Point also collaborates with large multinational technology firms in a data-sharing alliance in the belief that co-operation is key to staying one step ahead of the hackers.But while such approaches show promise, Check Point's Neatsun Ziv concludes that: "There is no such thing as an unhackable computer, the only thing that exists is the gap between what you build and what people know how to hack today."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What could happen if the UK's 5G networks suffered a major cyber-attack?There is always a trade-off between usability and security.The more secure and hack-proof a computer is, the less practical it is in a networked world."Yes, we can build an unhackable computer but it would be like a tank with so many shields that it wouldn't move anywhere," says Morphisec's Mr Danieli.The concern for the cyber-security industry is that as the nascent "internet of things" develops, powered by 5G mobile connectivity, the risk of cyber-attack will only increase.And as artificial intelligence becomes more widespread, it will become just another tool hackers can exploit.The arms race continues.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
'Why I quit as a barrister to follow my dream job':::::Image copyright Mowgli Street Food Image caption Nisha Katona was a barrister before she became a restaurateur The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to 48-year-old Nisha Katona, founder of Mowgli Street Food - a contemporary Indian restaurant chain in the UK.When Nisha Katona decided to quit her successful career as a barrister after 20 years to open a restaurant, her friends and family thought she was having a mid-life crisis.Nisha knew the move would come with risks as she would be giving up a well paid job and had a mortgage to pay.But she had long had a dream to become a professional chef and it was starting to give her sleepless nights.So while she was still working full time in 2014, as a family and child law barrister in Liverpool, she decided to take the plunge and opened Mowgli.Image copyright Mowgli Street Food Image caption Nisha says the food at Mowgli is a "far cry" from what's served at traditional curry houses The Liverpool restaurant, which specialises in "authentic" Indian cuisine, quickly took off and has since grown into a UK-wide chain with sales of 10m."Mowgli is a pet name I have for my two teenage girls which literally means feral child," Nisha says of the name, which is not, as some people think, linked to the famous Jungle Book character."My daughters chose the logo and the restaurant was named after them."The daughter of Indians who emigrated to Lancashire in the 1960s, Nisha was always obsessed with Indian cuisine and even used to plan her holidays around trying new foods.She says she has taken cookery lessons all around the world, but never from professional chefs, only home cooks and "usually grandmothers".Before she launched Mowgli she gave cookery lessons herself, launching her own Youtube channel.And she did lots of market research - for instance, standing in the corner of restaurant kitchens at night to see how they operated.Image copyright Mowgli Street Food Image caption There are now seven Mowgli restaurants across the UK Nisha says Mowgli is about showing how Indians eat at home and on the streets, which is a "far cry" from what you find at traditional UK curry houses.She says her dishes, which are all based on family recipes, are "simple, fresh and delicate" while having a modern twist."What I want is people to understand how my grandmother cooked.This is how we, as Indians, eat at home.We don't have a balti or a bhuna, and we don't have naan breads and poppadoms."Her passion for Indian cuisine has also led her to write three of her own cookbooks - Pimp My Rice, The Spice Tree and Mowgli Street Food.Image copyright Mowgli Street Food Image caption Nisha has written several cook books "I still remember when I wrote my first cook book.I'd never written a book in my life, so I thought how do I publish this?I looked in the Jamie Oliver cook book and Googled some of the names in his acknowledgments."One was his agent and so I sent her my proposal, and within 10 minutes she wrote back to me and said 'can we meet on Monday'?And she signed me on."But despite her success, Nisha says starting her first restaurant wasn't easy.As a second-generation immigrant living in 1970s Britain, she had developed "a thick skin" early on in life, and she had been the first female Asian barrister in Liverpool.But she was still unprepared for the pressures she faced as a woman entering the male-dominated restaurant scene.More The Boss features: "As I was building Mowgli, at times I was met with disdain from friends and family as I threw myself into the business and had less time to spend with my daughters."It struck me that if I were the husband, or simply the man, I wouldn't receive this criticism.And unfortunately, in this day and age, I still must fight my corner as a businesswoman."The fact there were so few female role models in the industry didn't help, she says, as she would have loved a woman to have "guided her or been a mentor".Today the entrepreneur runs seven successful Mowgli restaurants in cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Oxford.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Nisha Katona was given an MBE this year "The fact that Nisha has opened not one or two but seven restaurants in the UK, in just over four years, means she is definitely doing something right, especially in today's highly competitive food industry," says Mr Yawar Khan, head of the Asian Catering Federation.He also says giving up her job and starting a new career in her 40s took "courage and guts"."South Asian women need more role models like Nisha to encourage them to start restaurants and curry houses."Earlier this year Nisha achieved another milestone when she made The New Year Honours list and was awarded an MBE in recognition of her services to the British food industry."It just felt like a blessing.It was almost as though we got royal assent for my mother's dhal," she says."It was the most moving moment and what it meant to my mother, who came to England 50 years ago with nothing, is beyond words."
The nations of the Amazon want the name back:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Amazon countries say giving control of the domain to the tech giant could impact on their sovereignty Online retail giant Amazon and the governments of eight South American countries have been given a final deadline to reach an agreement over how to use the ".amazon" web address extension after a seven-year dispute.What will happen next?It's a name that evokes epic proportions: the world's largest rainforest; a global tech company; and now a diplomatic saga nearing its end.This is the battle of the Amazon and it starts back in 2012.The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the body that polices the world wide web's address system, decided to expand its list of generic top-level domains (gTLD) - the bit that comes after the dot in a web address.The new rules allowed companies to apply for brand new extensions, offering internet users and businesses more ways to personalise their website name and addresses.But eight countries containing the Amazon rainforest objected to the retail giant's plans concerning the new .amazon domain name.Image caption The case is pitting Amazon rainforest countries against the US tech giant The governments of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela - all members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) - say that relinquishing the domain exclusively to Amazon could impact on matters of their sovereignty.Diplomats have told the BBC that they are not seeking to deny Amazon use of the domain but are proposing a "shared governance" of it.According to their proposals, Amazon would be immediately allowed to use the domains which are relevant to its commercial interests, such as "books.amazon" or "kindle.amazon".But each country in turn would be entitled to use domains which relate to their cultural heritage - imagine Amazon nations coming together to promote the region under the "tourism.amazon" domain, for example.Crucially, the countries want to establish a committee in which both Amazon and the eight countries would have the opportunity to object to new top-level domains in the future.But Amazon has rejected these proposals, instead suggesting that the .amazon extension be used in conjunction with two letters representing each country - br.amazon for Brazil, for example.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Users can now end their website names with more than 1,200 new extensions, including .blog and .you The company has declined to comment ahead of the 7 April deadline, but pointed to previous remarks by its vice-president of public policy, Brian Huseman, who vowed that Amazon "will not use the TLDs in a confusing manner".Amazon has promised to work with governments to identify and block the use of "names that touch national sensitivities" and has pledged to support a new top-level domain using local terms such as .amazonia and .amazonas.And last year it tried to persuade the countries by promising them $5m (3.8m) worth of free Kindle e-readers and hosting services.They turned down the offer.In a letter sent to ICANN in March, the Ecuadorian Ambassador to the US, Francisco Carrin, said: "We are not looking for financial compensation.Nor are we after ex-gratia concessions to use one or a few second-level domains."It is a matter of sovereignty for many of us, and the offer to share the TLDs with the company Amazon Inc. is already a compromise."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Other contentious cases of geographical TLDs include .patagonia and .africa The current dispute follows similar cases already settled.In 2013, for example, the US-based outdoor clothing brand Patagonia withdrew an application for the .patagonia extension after objection from Argentina and Chile.A Mexico-based company had to reach a financial agreement with the town of Bar, Montenegro, in order to obtain consent to register the .bar extension.And in 2016, ICANN granted the registry of the .africa gTLD to a charity based in Johannesburg, South Africa, after it received support from three quarters of African Union countries.But the Amazon saga has been quite unlike any other.More Technology of Business Amazon's application was initially deferred, but Brazilian and Peruvian diplomats managed to overturn it by securing the support of the group that represents governments within ICANN - the GAC.That in itself required diplomatic pressure to change the US position from supporting Amazon Inc. to remaining neutral in the dispute.Then Amazon appealed and a review panel ordered ICANN to make a decision by reaching its own conclusions.If the parties don't reach a consensus by 7 April, Amazon will have two weeks to argue its case again before ICANN makes up its mind.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption ICANN is under pressure to resist the push of governments concerning geographic domain names The case is prompting questions about the independence of ICANN.Amazon's Brian Huseman told ICANN that "globally, hundreds (if not thousands) of brands have names similar to regions, land formations, mountains, towns, cities, and other geographic places".These could be put off applying for new gTLDs because of "uncertainty" over ICANN policy over geographic names.The US-based body is under pressure to resist the push of governments and some believe it might be more open to arguments coming from the business sector this time around.But Daniel Sepulveda, who served as a US Ambassador, deputy assistant secretary of state, and co-ordinator for communications and information policy from 2013 to 2017, says: "The ICANN community would make a mistake if it diminishes Brazil's concerns or engages in aggressive libertarian rhetoric".He believes ICANN needs to strike a fine balance between the interests and freedoms of businesses, organisations and individuals using the internet, without alienating anyone."This is a sensitive situation that requires diplomacy, the exercise of mutual respect, and creative mechanisms for ensuring all sides feel fairly treated," he says.So if Amazon and the eight nations don't reach agreement before the deadline, ICANN has a very difficult decision to make - one that might end up pleasing no-one.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Uruguay: The world’s marijuana pioneer:::::Image copyright IRCCA Image caption Uruguay legalised marijuana for recreational use in 2013 Uruguay was the first country in the world to legalise recreational cannabis.Five years after its pioneering law was passed, how's the industry getting on?"We sold a lot of cannabis on the first day," says Esteban Riviera, who owns a large, modern-looking pharmacy in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital."We sold 1,250 packages in six hours.There was a two-block queue to get marijuana."The legal sale of cannabis had been much anticipated.Sales began on 19 July 2017, more than three-and-a-half years after Uruguay's marijuana law had been passed."It took them time, the government said, because they want to do it precisely and step by step," explains Guillermo Draper, a Uruguayan journalist who's co-written a book on his country's pioneering experiment.Image caption Marijuana can only be sold in pharmacies But this assiduous approach to implementing the marijuana law wasn't enough to avoid a serious hiccup."My bank told me either stop selling cannabis or close my accounts," says Esteban Riviera, the pharmacist."I stopped selling cannabis."I was the first pharmacy registered to sell cannabis," he adds, chuckling drily at the irony, "but I was also the first pharmacy that stopped selling cannabis in Uruguay."Lenders like Esteban's rely on partnerships with US banks for their international transactions.But those partnerships came under threat when the US banks learnt their Uruguayan counterparts were accepting marijuana money.Uruguay might be a sovereign country, but it's still affected by the US's strict finance laws on controlled substances.Pharmacies are the only places allowed to sell recreational marijuana in Uruguay and - partly because of the restrictions facing banks - there are only 17 doing so in a country of 3.5 million people.Image caption Uruguay also controls the strength of the marijuana being sold So, 18 months after marijuana went on sale, the novelty may have waned, but the queues haven't."I am standing in the sun, burning hot, waiting for 2pm when they'll start selling," explains a young woman in the queue outside another Montevideo pharmacy - one still selling cannabis."This is one of the pharmacies who have more packages to sell without reserving online.There's a lot of pharmacies who have less, so a lot of people go home without weed and that's pretty sad."The system is tightly controlled.Customers have to register with the regulator and then are limited to buying 10 grams a week, enough for about 20 joints.The regulator also controls how strong the marijuana is.The level of THC - the psychoactive part of cannabis that gets you high - is limited and balanced with the level of CBD, another compound in the plant that's said to have a calming effect.Image caption Customers queue outside a pharmacy to buy cannabis In pharmacies, there are just four different strains available to buy, none of which is especially strong.The price - about 5 for a five-gram packet - is also set by the regulator.Pharmacy owner Gabriel Llano says he only gets about 20% of the purchase price from each packet he sells, although there's a higher profit margin on related products like snacks and smoking papers, which are a slightly odd sight in a pharmacy.When sales begin, customers come in one at a time and put a thumb and finger on a print reader to prove that they're registered to buy - and haven't already reached their limit for the month.Then they hand over their cash.It has to be cash, Gabriel explains, because that's the condition on which his bank has let him keep his account.The bank's official line is that it doesn't work with businesses linked to cannabis and that it's continuing to close the accounts of such businesses "when appropriate".The rationale for changing the law here was to move buyers from the illegal market to a new legal one.But the queues outside pharmacies suggest that in the legal market, supply isn't meeting demand.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: "In Uruguay, no one had ever grown marijuana on a big scale before," says Diego Olivera, the secretary-general of Uruguay's National Drugs Board, who also oversees the cannabis regulator, IRCCA.He says that now cannabis firms are more experienced, "we anticipate that they are going to be able to produce at a faster pace".IRCCA also plans to issue four or five new licences to grow recreational marijuana, as only two firms are currently permitted to produce the plant.Diego accepts that Uruguay's approach has been more cautious than that of some US states where marijuana has been legalised.That's meant recreational sales haven't been bringing in big profits for the companies involved.But the government is much more supportive of businesses growing marijuana for medicinal use, which was also legalised under the 2013 law.Image caption One of the most accepted uses of medicinal cannabis is for chronic pain, says Helena Gonzalez Ramos Local producers have been trying to capitalise on this opportunity.ICC Labs, one of the two licensed growers of recreational marijuana, is also involved in medicinal marijuana, which has higher profit margins and a rising number of potential export markets.This is perhaps why a big Canadian cannabis company - Aurora - recently paid $220m (167m) to buy ICC.Aurora said that the deal would position it as the market leader in Latin America.In October last year, Canada became the second country in the world to legalise recreational marijuana but its medicinal market has been going since 2001.The medicinal side of ICCs business is focused on the extraction of CBD from marijuana.Fotmer, a privately owned firm, is the first with a licence to produce THC for medicinal use."One of the most accepted uses of THC is for chronic pain, specifically when it is neuropathic," Helena Gonzalez Ramos, Fotmer's manager of quality and research and development, explains."That is rigidity in your muscles, palliative care, vomiting [and] nausea."Uruguay's approach to recreational marijuana has limited the business potential of the industry.But when it comes to medicinal marijuana, Uruguayan companies like Fotmer are aiming to help shape a rapidly growing global industry."The main markets nowadays are Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, and some others, mainly in Europe," Helena says."And the regulation is changing all the time so the forecasts are also promising as medical marijuana is legalised around the world."For more on this story, you can listen to the World Service's Global Business radio programme on Uruguay and its marijuana laws.
Paternity leave: 'All of my dad friends were incredibly jealous':::::Image copyright Piers Fenwick Image caption Piers Fenwick with his sons Matthew and William It's the dream of many dads: being able to spend more time with their children.For many people, work commitments make it difficult to have as much time as they would like with their growing kids.And right from the start, pressure on families is not helped if it's only possible to take a short paternity leave.But what would it be like if firms let dads take six months paid paternity leave?'It was fantastic' In 2017, Aviva, which at the time was the UK's largest insurer, started to let all new parents have the same amount of paid leave.Piers Fenwick, who works for Aviva in Norwich as an analyst on its fraud team, recently took six months off around the birth of his youngest son, William."It was just a really great opportunity to help my wife, bond with my new son, and spend time with my eldest," "I think my wife quite liked having me around.Fingers crossed," he says.Piers is 31, and is married to Kylie Fenwick, 30.They have two children: Matthew, who is two, and William, six months."Overall, it was fantastic, and all of my dad friends were incredibly jealous," he says."A lot of them work for companies that just do the statutory two weeks, and they would have to take unpaid or shared parental leave [to get the same amount of time off]."'Part of the family' Piers is one of hundreds of employees at Aviva who have taken advantage of the perk.In the UK, 496 Aviva employees used the policy in the first 10.5 months - 268 female, and 228 male workers.Piers says that being able to take the chunk of paid paternity leave didn't exactly bind him to the firm, but had made him want to give back."It really does motivate you in thinking this company cares.It makes you feel part of the family."He adds that "it would really take something very special to be a more attractive proposition" in terms of moving to a different employer."I really don't know what it would take to tempt me away."Paid leave While it is not widespread in the UK, two big UK firms this week announced they will be extending paid paternity leave.On Monday, mobile operator O2 said it will increase its paid paternity leave to 14 weeks for all permanent employees, covering heterosexual and same-sex couples, as well as adoptive and surrogate partners.And on Wednesday, drinks giant Diageo said its 4,500 employees will be able to get an equal 52 weeks parental leave, with the first 26 weeks fully paid.Mairad Nayager, chief HR officer at Diageo said: "True gender equality in the working world requires fundamental changes to a broad range of working practices, including a shake-up of the policies and cultural norms around parental leave."Today's announcement is about matching ambition with action and supporting all of our colleagues - regardless of gender - to experience the joy of raising a young family, while continuing to thrive at work."High employment HR professional body the CIPD said some employers "recognise the need for greater balance when it comes to parenting and are increasing paternity leave and pay as a result".Claire McCartney, CIPD diversity and inclusion adviser, said: "Parental leave is a key way of supporting parents in the workplace.It can help them to establish a strong relationship with their children and gives them time to set up childcare systems that work for them going forward."Ms McCartney added that firms were increasingly having to compete for employees.In February, UK employment hit another record high."With a tight labour market, employers also know they need to stand out from the crowd," she said."Those organisations that offer attractive parental leave and pay policies will be more desirable to working parents who represent a high proportion of the workforce."However, a spokesperson for the Institute of Directors said small firms operated under different constraints to large firms.While many small firms were sympathetic to the needs of parents, and were encouraging flexible working, they were also dealing with other pressures and costs, such as this week's introduction of the HMRC Making Tax Digital scheme, the spokesperson said.
The teenage hackers who've been given a second chance:::::Image copyright Getty Images Step inside the offices of Bluescreen and you'll find some of the UK's most talented young hackers, dragged from a world of crime to fight for the other side.These computer experts have swapped the confines of their bedrooms for a fairly ordinary looking cyber-security company in Plymouth.Bluescreen employs hackers the authorities have deemed worthy of a second chance, who pit their wits against some of the anonymous online criminals they used to see as brothers in arms.Image caption Jack stole personal information from thousands of people When Jack was 19 years old, the police sent five squad cars, a tech team and a riot van to his home."It was about 08:10 in the morning.I'd had the most awful night's sleep and I'd just started watching The Lion King."It didn't even get past the intro before my bedroom door flew open and 10 police officers came in to arrest me."I was not expecting that on any day of my life."The police were there for a good reason: when he was 16, Jack had stolen personal information from about 1,000 people.He told police he'd never had any intention of using it for his own gain; to him, it was just an intellectual exercise.Stories like this are not uncommon at Bluescreen IT, which has a direct link with the police to find hackers in need of direction.These are young men who have been accused of serious crimes, but instead of being taken through the criminal justice system, they've been given a second chance.About 15 people work in the Security Operations Centre, a handful of whom have been referred to the company as hackers who aren't malicious in nature and are deemed capable of reform.Image caption Cameron launched cyber attacks, and was caught by the National Crime Agency Another employee, Cameron, was arrested on his way to school when he was just 14 years old.Officers from the National Crime Agency had planned the sting so that Cameron would be out of the house, and unable to destroy his hard drives in the event he heard them coming."Up to that point my biggest worry was that I hadn't done my maths homework," he said."I was walking to school when I heard my name being called.I turned round and there was a man in a suit walking behind me."Then I heard him say my name louder, so I turned around and said 'yeah?'and that's when he told me I was under arrest."I turned around and there were five more officers spread out across the grass."I just didn't realise that what I'd done was that serious.It was all just one big joke - messing around - it never seemed like I was actually causing any real harm.I soon found out how serious it was.""Grey hat hackers" like Jack and Cameron are seen as having committed their crimes for reasons that weren't to do with personal gain or cyber-terrorism.Sometimes it might have been a practical joke, or perhaps the motive was to launch a server-debilitating attack.Now they try to stop others - using the methods they once employed - from wreaking the same havoc.Image copyright Getty Images Hackers' hats White hat hackers - These are the nice guys of the hacking world.They know what they're doing and they use their talents for good, such as getting rid of viruses or legitimately testing the security systems of companies and governments.Black hat hackers - The bad guys.They're the ones who steal your bank details and sell them on the dark web.They usually hack for personal gain, although it could be some form of cyber-espionage or protest.Grey hat hackers - Somewhere in between.They might hack a company without permission, only to point out the flaws without exploiting them.What they're doing is still illegal.The route into a life of hacking isn't always the same, but a lot of the stories are similar, and they often start with gaming.When he was younger, Cameron liked to tinker with things to see how they worked."I didn't like my high scores being beaten in video games - I always had to be the best at them."He started making "mods" to video games - changes to the code that enabled him to get higher scores - which he said led him to online forums, and then darker areas of the internet."I ended up launching cyber attacks, and was later caught by the National Crime Agency," Cameron said.You may also be interested in: Image caption The team at Bluescreen has some big personalities, and people from vastly different backgrounds For Jack, now 23, it was his "laziness" that led him into the world of computing."I was 12.We'd just started doing algebra, but I didn't want to do it."I went home and tried to make a calculator for algebra.It didn't really go well, but that is my earliest memory of that side of things."I was trying to cut corners any way I could.Rather than studying, I would try and make it look like I was studying and doing well."I'd be failing in all my classes but pull it out of the bag at the last minute.After a while the school had had enough of me."I got my five GCSEs in Year 10 and then the school expelled me."Just four years after his arrest, Jack is now working at an advanced level, carrying out processes like penetration testing - trying to break into clients' servers to find weaknesses.He and Cameron, now 19, also defend against incoming attacks - an area where their hacking experience comes in handy.Image caption Det Sgt John Atkin found himself attending the same course as Cameron, who he arrested in 2014 One of the more surreal moments in Cameron's first year at Bluescreen was going on the same course as the police officer who had arrested him in 2014.Det Sgt John Atkin from the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit was attending a Bluescreen security course as part of his own professional development.Cameron said: "It's unbelievable - what are the chances of that?"I never would've thought when he was arresting me as a 14-year-old kid, that we'd one day be on the same course."There's an element of learning from each other now.Whenever something comes up in forensics he's the man to explain it best; we're lucky to have him there."And then for the attacks I can explain it better."We always got along, but I don't think John appreciated much of what I did."Det Sgt Atkin has "no problem" meeting the hackers he's arrested because the whole point of the police Cyber Futures programme is to "try and develop people"."What you can see here is that by working with Cameron and his family, and providing the support and knowledge we have, we're able to deliver and put him in a place where his future is set, rather than where he could have been."Cameron's a good kid so he's doing really well; the future's bright for him.Hopefully, he'll take this forward and then the world's his oyster."Image caption The Security Operations Centre is where the analysts defend incoming attacks There's a relaxed atmosphere when you walk into the Security Operations Centre, but it's serious work.Three monitors on the wall detail which of Bluescreen's clients are being attacked, and how serious the threat is.The clients, mostly smaller and medium-sized businesses from around the South West, are given codenames like "Black Mamba" or "Green Starfish" - usually a colour and an animal.The business has just won part of a 500,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to encourage more diverse candidates into cyber-security jobs, meaning it can keep growing, and potentially take on more former hackers.As apprentices, employees like Jack and Cameron start on a wage of about 650 a month, but after five years of experience they could easily be earning close to 50,000 a year.But for some reformed hackers, moving into a professional environment can be a big adjustment: even getting out of bed on time is sometimes a bit of a struggle for young men used to working unsupervised, to their own schedule and their own rules.Now they must do regular office hours as part of a team dedicated to protecting the interests of the company's clients.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Adjusting to a nine-to-five job isn't always easy for Bluescreen's former hackers It's not just a challenge for the new recruits: some of the hackers who arrive at Bluescreen are autistic, which isn't something that management have had much experience of dealing with."It's been a really hard journey for us and a massive learning curve," said the company's chief operating officer, Richard Cashmore."We've had to adapt how we manage people - if they need to work in a certain space, we'll go and do that."It's about give and take - we can't bend over too far for them because we need them to be employable, but we meet in the middle."Bluescreen sees itself as a place to develop young people, give them a second chance, and be a haven for those with nowhere else to go."It makes me really proud when they achieve industry-recognised qualifications," said Mr Cashmore."It's a big deal for them and it's a big deal for us, because we invest a lot of time and emotional effort into these guys, and seeing them succeed after everything we've all been through is very satisfying."
What can bees teach economists about how markets work?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It's a little known fact that economists love bees - or at least, the idea of bees.The Royal Economic Society's logo is a honeybee.The Fable Of The Bees, published in 1732, uses honeybees as a metaphor for the economy - and anticipates modern economic concepts such as the division of labour and the "invisible hand" that means "greed is good".And when a future winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, James Meade, was looking for an example of a tricky idea in economic theory, he turned to the honeybee for inspiration.The tricky idea was what economists call a "positive externality" - something good that a free market won't produce enough of, meaning that the government might want to subsidise it.For James Meade, the perfect example of a positive externality was the relationship between apples and bees.Imagine, wrote Meade in 1952, a region containing some orchards and some bee-keeping.If the apple farmers planted more apple trees, the bee-keepers would benefit, because that would mean more honey.But the apple farmers wouldn't enjoy that benefit, that positive externality, and so they wouldn't plant as many apple trees as would be best for everyone.This was, according to Meade, "due simply and solely to the fact that the apple farmer cannot charge the bee-keeper for the bees' food".But there's a problem with his thesis.Apple blossom produces almost no honey.And that's only the first thing James Meade didn't know about bees.Find out more: 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.To understand Meade's more fundamental error, we need a brief history of humans and honeybees.Once upon a time, there was no bee-keeping - only honey hunting, trying to steal honeycombs from wild bees.We see this depicted in cave paintings.Then, at least 5,000 years ago, the practice was formalised.The Greeks, the Egyptians, and the Romans were all partial to domesticated honey.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ancient Egyptians attached great religious and spiritual significance to the honeybee By the Middle Ages, bee-keepers were using skep hives - they're the classic woven beehives that look like a tapering stack of straw tyres.But the trouble with skep hives is that if you want the honey, you need to get rid of the bees - and bee-keepers would generally poison them with sulphurous smoke, shake them off, scoop out the honey, and worry about building another bee colony in due course.In time, though, people started to worry about this waste and disdain for a creature that not only gives us honey but also pollinates our plants.In the 1830s, a bee-rights movement emerged in the US, with the motto: "Never kill a bee."And, in 1852, the US Patent Office awarded patent number 9300A to clergyman Lorenzo Langstroth for a moveable-frame beehive.Image copyright Science Photo Library The Langstroth hive is a wooden box with an opening at the top and frames that hang down, carefully separated from each other by the magic gap of 8mm (0.3in) "bee space" - any smaller, or larger, and the bees start adding their own inconvenient structures.The queen is at the bottom, confined by a "queen excluder" - a mesh that prevents her entry but permits worker bees through.This keeps her bee larvae out of the honeycombs.The honeycombs are easily pulled out and harvested by a spinning centrifuge that flings out, filters and collects the honey.A marvel of design and efficiency, this new hive allowed the industrialisation of the bee.And it's this industrialisation that James Meade hadn't quite grasped.The honeybee is a thoroughly domesticated animal.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Writer Sylvia Plath, whose father was a bee expert, wrote a series of vivid poems about the physicality of bee-keeping and extracting honey With Langstroth hives, bees are portable.Nothing stops farmers coming to some financial arrangement with bee-keepers to locate hives amid their crops.A couple of decades after James Meade's famous example, another economist, Steven Cheung, became curious about it - and he did something we economists perhaps don't do often enough: he called up some real people and asked them what actually happens.More things that made the modern economy: He discovered that apple farmers routinely paid bee-keepers for the service of pollinating their crops.For some other crops, the bee-keepers do indeed pay farmers for the right to harvest their nectar, the market Meade said should exist but could not.One example is mint, which doesn't need any help from bees but which produces good honey.So apples and bees aren't a good example of a positive externality, because the interaction does take place in a marketplace.And that marketplace is huge.These days, its centre of gravity is the California almond industry.Almonds occupy almost a million acres (4,000 sq km) of California - and farmers sell about $5bn (3.9bn) worth per year.Almonds need honeybees - five colonies per hectare (10,000 sq m), rented for about $185 (144) a colony.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bees play a crucial role in California's almond industry Langstroth hives are duly strapped together, loaded on to the back of articulated lorries, 400 hives per truck, and driven to the Californian almond groves each spring, travelling by night while the bees are asleep.The numbers are astonishing: 85% of the two million commercial hives in the US are moved, containing tens of billions of bees.As Bee Wilson describes in The Hive: The Story of the Honeybee and Us, the big US bee-keepers manage 10,000 hives each and from California they may travel up to Washington state's cherry orchards, then east to the sunflowers of North and South Dakota and then on to the pumpkin fields of Pennsylvania or the blueberries of Maine.Meade was quite wrong to imagine beekeeping as some kind of rural idyll.Bees have been almost fully industrialised, and pollination thoroughly commercialised.And that presents a conundrum.Ecologists are worried about wild bee populations, which are in sharp decline in many parts of the world.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The fall in global bee number has been linked to the use of neonicotinoid insecticides Nobody quite knows why.Candidates for blame include parasites, pesticides and the mysterious "colony collapse disorder", where bees simply disappear, leaving a lone queen behind.New clues to decline of bees and other pollinators Can listening to bees help save them - and us?Why do we hate wasps and love bees?Domesticated bees face the same pressures, so you might expect to see some simple economics at work - a reduction in the supply of bees increasing the price of pollination services.But that's not what economists see at all.Colony collapse disorder appears to have had minimal effect on any practical metric in the bee market.Farmers are paying much the same for pollination, and the price of new queens - which are specially bred - has hardly budged.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Queen bees are vital to the wellbeing of their hive and there is a large market for specially bred ones It appears that industrial bee-keepers have managed to develop strategies for maintaining the populations on which they rely: breeding and trading queens, splitting colonies and buying booster packs of bees.That is why there is no shortage of honey - or almonds, or apples, or blueberries - not yet, anyway.Should we celebrate economic incentives for preserving at least some populations of bees?Well, maybe.Another perspective is that it's precisely the modern economy's longstanding drive to control and monetise the natural world that caused the problem in the first place.Before monocrop agriculture changed ecosystems, there was no need to lug Langstroth hives around the countryside to pollinate crops - local populations of wild insects did the job free of charge.So if we want an example of a positive externality - something the free market won't provide as much of as society would like - perhaps we should look to land uses that help wild bees and other insects.Wildflower meadows, perhaps - and some governments are indeed subsidising these, just as James Meade would have advised.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economyis broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes onlineor subscribe to the programme podcast.
Gender pay gap: What is the pay gap where I work?:::::With the deadline for British companies to disclose their gender pay gaps just days away, thousands of firms have yet to submit their figures.Three-quarters of firms pay men more than they pay women on average, based on those who have reported so far.To find out the pay gap at your company, use the lookup below.All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps.Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women.How big is the pay gap at...?Type in a company name below ...for every 10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]] Number of companies by pay gap >50 25 0% 25 >50 If you cannot see the calculator, please click here Understanding the terminology Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man.If you line up all the men and women working at a company in two separate lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his.Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend per woman and its total spend per man.The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation.Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay.Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work.That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970.A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things - for example, fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs.This article is based on the difference in what men and women are paid per hour, but there are other ways of calculating the gender pay gap: the Office for National Statistics releases annual figures here.How does the BBC calculator work?The individual company data reflects the information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office as of 1 April.The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the "snapshot date" - the previous year.For businesses and charities, 5 April is the snapshot date, while 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations.All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.Calculator design and development: Irene de la Torre Arenas, Becky Rush, Scott Jarvis, Alexander Ivanov and Oliver Schnuck.
What's the new weapon against money laundering gangsters?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gangster Al Capone was eventually convicted of tax evasion in 1931 Money laundering accounts for up to 5% of global GDP - or $2tn (1.5tn) - every year, says the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.So banks and law enforcement agencies are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help combat the growing problem.But will it work?Money laundering, so-called after gangster Al Capone's practice of hiding criminal proceeds in cash-only laundromats in the 1920s, is a huge and growing problem."Dirty" money is "cleaned" by passing it through layers of seemingly legitimate banks and businesses and using it to buy properties, businesses, expensive cars, works of art - anything that can be sold on for new cash.And one of the ways criminals do this is called "smurfing".Specialist software is used to arrange lots of tiny bank deposits that slip below the radar, explains Mark Gazit, chief executive of ThetaRay, a financial crime AI provider headquartered in Israel."A $0.25 transaction will never be spotted by a human, but transactions of that kind can launder $30m if they are done hundreds of millions of times," he says.And stolen money is often laundered to fund further criminal activity.One recent ATM (cash machine) scam cost banks 1bn (854m) in total across 40 countries, for example.Image copyright ThetaRay Image caption ThetaRay boss Mark Gazit says AI can spot patterns of criminal behaviour "The gang hacked into thousands of ATMs and programmed them to release up to five notes at a certain time - say 3am - at which point a local criminal or 'money mule' would pick it up," says Mr Gazit."The money was then converted into Bitcoin and used to fund human trafficking.""Money mules" are often recruited to launder this gang cash through their legitimate bank accounts in return for a fee."Estimates suggest that not even 1% of criminal funds flowing through the international financial system is confiscated," says Colin Bell, group head of financial crime risk at HSBC.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The dangerous world of teen "money mules" And the problem seems to be getting worse, despite tightening regulations.In the UK alone, financial crime Suspicious Activity Reports increased by 10% in 2018, according to the National Crime Agency.The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the BBC it was working on "applied technical enhancements" to its armoury of crime-fighting tools to help it keep up with advances in financial tech, but remains understandably tight-lipped on the details.However, other organisations are openly talking about their use of AI to fight the money launderers.More Technology of Business "AI that applies 'machine learning' can sift through vast quantities of transactions quickly and effectively," explains HSBC's Mr Bell."This could be a vital tool for pinpointing suspicious activity."For this reason, AI is good at spotting smurfing attempts and accounts that are set up remotely by bots rather than humans, for example.And it can also spot suspicious behaviour by corrupt insiders - a key element in many money laundering operations."Using AI removes much of the risk of people deliberately overlooking suspicious activity," says Adam Williamson, head of professional standards at the UK's Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) - a professional body tasked with helping accountants avoid money laundering.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Several high-profile banks have been caught up in money laundering scandals recently Many of the world's biggest banks have been embroiled in money laundering scandals in recent years.Earlier this year, Swiss banking giant UBS was hit with a 3.7bn (3.2bn) fine after being found guilty of helping wealthy clients in France hide billions of euros from tax authorities and launder the proceeds.It is appealing against the decision.Last year, Dutch bank ING paid out 775 million for failing to stop criminals laundering money through its accounts.And Danske Bank's boss was forced to quit over a 200bn money laundering scandal involving its Estonian branch.In Latvia, too, the country's third largest bank ABLV Bank AS, was wound up after US authorities accused it of large-scale money laundering that had enabled its clients to violate nuclear weapons sanctions against North Korea.AI can crunch mountains of data in real time - emails, phone calls, expense reports - and spot patterns of behaviour humans might not notice across a global banking group.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin have given gangs another way to launder their cash Once the system has learned legitimate behaviour patterns it can then more easily spot dodgy activity and learn from that.Regulators around the world are encouraging the new technology, perhaps in acknowledgement that they are losing the battle.US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) director Kenneth A. Blanco says: "Financial institutions have been improving their ability to identify customers and monitor transactions by experimenting with artificial intelligence and machine learning."FinCEN encourages these and other financial services-related innovations."AI tech firms, such as ThetaRay, LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Refinitiv, are offering businesses tools to tackle money laundering, but there are concerns that this presents its own problems."If organisations are buying AI off the shelf, how can they convince regulators they are in control of it?"asks the AAT's Adam Williamson.And as good as AI might be at spotting anomalies when sifting through huge swathes of data, it is only as effective as the data it is fed.So there is a growing recognition of the need for banks, financial institutions, governments, and law enforcement agencies to share more information."Europol is designed to operate in partnership with law enforcement agencies, governmental departments and other stakeholders," says the agency's deputy executive director Wil van Gemert."We embrace the idea of collective intelligence."Mark Hayward, a member of the UK's new Economic Crime Strategic Board, set up in January, says: "Data sharing is one of our main priorities".And legislation has to keep up with the latest trends in financial services that criminals can exploit.The terrorists behind the 2016 Nice truck attack, for example, paid for the vehicles by pre-paid card to take advantage of the anonymity these cards afford the user.This is why the European Union's fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive introduced last year includes digital currencies and prepaid cards for the first time.Given that the criminals appear to be winning, any tools that can help tackle the problem must surely be welcome.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Why India's rich don't give their money away:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Premji is now one of the world's biggest philanthropists Indian IT billionaire Azim Premji recently became India's top philanthropist, sealing his place among the world's top givers.But his generosity has put philanthropy in the spotlight in a country where charity does not appear to match wealth.The BBC's Aparna Alluri reports.With his recent pledge of $7.5bn, Mr Premji's total philanthropic contribution now stands at some 1.45tn rupees ($21bn; 15.8bn).This puts him in the same league of givers - as philanthropists are called - as Bill and Melinda Gates, and Warren Buffet.What perhaps distinguishes him even more is that, unlike them, he is not one of the world's five richest people - the Bloomberg Billionaires Index ranks him at 51.But the philanthropic world was not surprised at his new status."This is not unusual for him because he's been the largest contributor in India and, even the continent, for some time," says Deval Sanghavi, co-founder of Dasra, a strategic philanthropy firm.It works with some of the biggest donors in India, directing their money to various causes and non-profits.In their universe, Mr Premji is a magnanimous "outlier".The 73-year-old software tycoon has been giving his wealth away for a long time.In 2013, he became the first Indian billionaire to sign the Giving Pledge, an initiative by Mr Gates and Mr Buffet that encourages wealthy individuals to pledge half their fortunes to philanthropy.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption (L-R) Bill Gates, Azim Premji , Melinda Gates and Warren Buffet during a press conference in Delhi He was just 21 when he dropped out of Stanford University to join Wipro, a company his father started in 1945.(He went back and finished school in 2000).Under him, Wipro, a refinery for vegetable oils, grew into one of India's biggest and most successful IT services firms.An intensely private man, Mr Premji rarely speaks in public or to the media.Yet, over the years, his unusually modest lifestyle and his generosity have earned him many admirers.Stories about how he still flies economy, or how he has, on occasion, hopped into a rickshaw, impress many in a country that values frugality, especially among the rich.News of his pledge came in a dry press statement issued by the Azim Premji Foundation and included no personal statement.According to one newspaper, he even asked "what's all the fuss about" when he was told that the pledge was generating headlines and buzz on social media.Mr Premji is not entirely alone in his generosity.IT billionaires Nandan and Rohini Nilekani have pledged 50% of their wealth to philanthropy; Biocon's Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw committed 75% of hers; and many other families fund hospitals, schools, community kitchens, the arts and scientific research.All of them, like Mr Premji, are pledging their personal wealth, largely earned in their own lifetimes.The Tata Trusts, endowed by the personal wealth and profits of one of India's biggest and oldest conglomerates, has been India's biggest philanthropic outfit for decades.It is only now rivalled by Mr Premji's foundation, which funds education, healthcare and independent media among other things."Premji's grant for the nation matches only what Jamsetji Tata and Dorabji Tata have done from a historical perspective," Amit Chandra, managing director, Bain Capital, told the Economic Times newspaper.Mr Premji's contributions over the past decade, he added, stand out across more than a century of Indian philanthropy - the first Tata trust was set up in 1892.Mr Premji accounted for 80% of the money given away by ultra-rich donors in India (anyone who has given more than $1.4m) in the 2018 financial year, according to a recent philanthropy report co-authored by Dasra and Bain.Philanthropy is growing, says Mr Sanghavi, but it's not growing fast enough.Private philanthropy in India grew at a rate of 15% per year between 2014 and 2018.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Premji Foundation works with government schools like these in northern India The Dasra report sees this as "particularly problematic" since ultra-rich households have grown at a rate of 12% over the past five years and are expected to double in both volume and wealth by 2022.Compared to the percentage of net worth given away in the US every year, the report estimates that India's rich could give $5bn to $8bn more each year.What is stopping them?"There is a great fear of the taxman," says Ingrid Srinath, director of the Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy at Delhi's Ashoka University."They [the rich] don't want to end up on any radar or become the subject of more appeals for money."She believes another reason could be that wealth in India is still only one generation old, and those who have it don't feel secure enough to give it away.But Ms Srinath also cautions against wholly relying on the data as it is incomplete, making it "hard to say anything definitive about philanthropy in India".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption IT billionaire Nandan Nilekani has pledged half of his wealth There is no centralised directory tracking philanthropy in India.Tax laws are complex and there aren't many incentives for giving.So reports, such as the one by Dasra, rely on multiple sources, from the government to third-party trackers to individual declarations.And many people give anonymously, which further complicates estimates of philanthropy."It's not considered cool to talk about how much you are giving," Ms Srinath says.Ashoka University, she adds, was partly funded by some 100 donors, each of whom gave more than $1.4m but refused to be acknowledged publicly.But Anant Bhagwati, one of the authors of the Dasra report, says that no matter how weak the data collection, large pledges are unlikely to fall through the cracks."If you look at those who have the money, they are not giving it," he says.Ms Srinath agrees: "The overwhelming sentiment is that we [Indians] could do better."Charity vs philanthropy Mr Bhagwati doesn't discount donors who fund individual universities or hospitals, but what Indian philanthropy needs, he says, is people who commit to solving a problem.And not just any problem - preferably, one of the daunting sustainable development goals or SDGs.These range from ending poverty and hunger to giving people access to clean energy.Strategic philanthropy - which Dasra advocates - makes a distinction between charity and philanthropy.While the former might involve feeding the poor on a single day, the latter would require investing in non-profits that work to decrease or end hunger altogether.By this measure, rich Indians might be charitable, but not enough of them are philanthropists.Read more stories from India More importantly, Mr Bhagwati says, philanthropy needs donors who will invest in the fight itself.By this he means pledges that don't specify how the money is to be spent.So, for instance, a non-profit that works to improve sanitation could use donor funds to build toilets, hire more people or even buy a laptop or other equipment that might make them more efficient.But most donors, Mr Bhagwati says, will set conditions about how they want the money spent.In other words, they will insist on the toilets being built.He calls this "restricted giving" and says it's hard to coax people to give any other way.But some of this is changing."Earlier you gave as much as you could and hoped something came of it," Ms Srinath says, adding that earlier, most people wanted to fund education."Education is to Indian philanthropy what cricket is to Indian sport," she says, laughing.But now, she adds, Indian philanthropy is finally diversifying into areas beyond education - sanitation, mental health and scientific research.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Mazumdar-Shaw has pledged 75% of her wealth for philanthropy The biggest challenge has been the gap between what Mr Sanghavi calls "action and intent".Some billionaires are just more willing to give their wealth away than others.He says he has heard several Indian philanthropists, including the Nilekanis, speak of how they see themselves as "trustees" of their wealth, which, according to them, rightfully belongs to the larger community.That is, they believe they owe the world their wealth.In a note explaining his decision to sign the Giving Pledge, Mr Premji said his mother was the "most significant influence" in his life and that he was also "deeply influenced by Gandhi's notion of holding one's wealth in trusteeship".Ms Srinath says philanthropists could be influenced by many things, from parents to community to faith.But generosity as a trait, she adds, is inexorably linked to a way of seeing the world and your role in it."It certainly has nothing to do with how much money you have."
'A lot of the team started to get ill':::::Image copyright Wahaca Image caption The business partners were introduced by a mutual friend because they both shared a love of Mexican food The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to Thomasina Miers and Mark Selby, founders of Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca.When staff at a number of Wahaca branches started falling ill, Mark Selby says "it was a fairly big shock".This was back in November 2016, when the UK business was hit by an outbreak of norovirus, otherwise known as the vomiting bug."A lot of the team started to get ill, and we didn't understand why," say Mark: "Then suddenly we started hearing from our customers a few days later."In the end 200 members of staff and 160 diners were affected by the virus, and Wahaca had to temporarily close nine of its 25 sites.Image copyright Wahaca Image caption The company has helped boost the popularity of Mexican food in the UK Not wanting employees to be out of pocket, the company continued to pay wages to everyone who was unable to work, even giving them an extra amount to compensate for the tips they were missing out on."It wasn't fair not to pay them," says Mark.Meanwhile, Thomasina sent personal apology notes to customers, embedded with wildflower seeds: "I thought even if they throw it away, they might still get wildflowers growing in their garden."Mark even visited a couple in Edinburgh who were affected by the virus on their wedding day."I had a chat with them for half an hour.I wanted to say 'I'm so sorry'."The co-founders never did find out where the norovirus originated from, but believe it might have come from a supplier."By the time we knew what it was, it had gone through [people's] systems," says Mark: "It came and went in a day, but the lasting effect was much greater."Image copyright Paul Adams Image caption There are now 25 Wahaca branches across the UK Financially the outbreak had a substantial impact on the business, with Wahaca saying it was responsible for a 4.7m loss that financial year, compared with profits of 600,000 for the preceding 12 months.Thankfully, the company was able to recover.Within a few weeks all of the affected restaurants were able to reopen and the business returned to profitability.Today the popular chain has annual revenues of 47.9m.Mark and Thomasina opened their first Wahaca restaurant in London's Covent Garden in 2007.They had been introduced by a mutual friend who knew they both had a passion for Mexican food.Thomasina had not long returned to the UK after spending a year in Mexico.She had gone to the country after winning BBC TV cookery competition Masterchef in 2005.Working in a friend's cocktail bar in Mexico City, she also travelled around the country to study all the regional food specialities.Image caption Thomasina (bottom right) found fame on TV show Masterchef "I'd gone to Mexico when I was 18, and I was obsessed about the food," she enthuses."I didn't have a game plan [on her second visit], but had gone out there on a fact-finding mission.I was driven out of curiosity as to why Mexican food just hadn't got to the UK yet."I wanted to learn more about the food from each region.I thought, 'this is nuts, that's the biggest gastronomical secret in the world... why wasn't it here in the UK?'."While Thomasina had a culinary background, Mark had been working at an investment firm called Capricorn Capital, which had a stake in chicken restaurant chain Nando's.With Capricorn prepared to invest an initial 5m in Wahaca, the business partners had an easier start to their careers as restaurateurs than most.But there were still obstacles to overcome.Image copyright Steven Joyce Image caption Thomasina first fell in love with Mexican food when she went to the country as an 18-year-old "The first day we opened [in Covent Garden], we had to close after half an hour because there was flooding from backed-up drains," recalls Mark.They'd also faced a staff shortage after placing a jobs advert online just 10 days before they opened."People said it would be easy [to find workers] but we had about four people apply, including a Texan who refused to take off his cowboy boots," says Thomasina."I said 'you can't cook in those shoes' and he was like 'I'm not taking them off'.We were like, 'this is harder than we thought'."But despite the initial challenges the company soon expanded, and now has 1,100 employees across 25 locations in the UK.More The Boss features: Capricorn is the majority shareholder, owning 65% of the business.Thomasina and Mark share the remaining 35% with brothers Adam and Sam Kaye, who set up the Ask and Zizzi restaurant chains.While Wahaca remains buoyant, other UK restaurant chains such as Prezzo, Byron, Jamie's Italian, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, and Giraffe, have had to close branches over the past year."Everyone is being hit," says Mark: "Rent, rates, wages and food costs have gone up - no-one could have forecast this.It's a perfect storm."As an example, he says that at Wahaca's central London Soho branch, its annual rent has gone up from 300,000 to 800,000.Image copyright Wahaca Image caption The business partners often travel to Mexico together to explore new food ideas Trish Caddy, senior food industry analyst at research group Mintel, says Wahaca will need to continue to focus on offering both good quality and good value for money, to tempt consumers who are cutting back on going out for meals."Although the ethnic restaurants market will continue to grow, much of that growth will come from businesses driving existing store performances on the back of strong brand management, menu development, and home delivery options."In other words, sit-down restaurant chains have become destination businesses, through offering healthier options, and a higher quality of food and drink and services."Against such a backdrop, there are no ambitious plans to open a Wahaca in every town and city."We're always looking, but we're not up for taking big risks," says Mark: "But we're constantly looking at our food and how to get it better."Thomasina, who also writes cookery books, adds: "What we want in the next 10 years is for people to say should we go for tacos, pizza or a burger in the same sentence."When that's happening, I feel like we've achieved what we wanted to do."
Can Northampton's 'dying' High Street be saved?:::::Image copyright Leon Neal/Getty Image caption About a third of units of Northampton's main thoroughfare are vacant The number of boarded-up shop fronts in towns the length and breadth of England is symbolic of the country's growing High Street crisis.Perhaps nowhere quite encapsulates this as much as Northampton, which in the past five years has lost three major department stores with the future of a fourth uncertain.In recent years countless big name chains like Woolworths, BHS, Toys R Us and Comet have faced the administrators and folded.Others have clung on, saved by rescue deals or by swapping their bricks and mortar businesses for the digital marketplace.That in itself appears to be a Catch-22.Only last month, MPs warned that British High Streets were "in danger of becoming ghost towns" as consumers flock to internet retailers.In towns like Northampton, there has been a slow drip of shop closures.And conspicuous by their absence are the shoppers that once used to crowd into its market square."The place used to be packed," says fruit and veg market trader, Anne Andreoli."It used to be rammed with customers and you'd be serving non-stop, all day."At one stage there was a 100-year waiting list to get a stall.Now you can take your pick.The change has been humongous."Image copyright Photofusion/Getty Image caption There was once a 100-year wait for a market stall in the town The square is one of Britain's largest and dates back to 1235.For centuries it was the centre of the town's bustling market trade."This used to be a good living but I struggle to cover the stall rent now," says Lesley McDonald, who has run an underwear stall for 28 years.She and her husband used to work on it together, but he is now a window cleaner - an income they rely on."There's just no trade.The youngsters shop online and since we lost M&S we've seen a big decline in older customers," she says."I get here at six in the morning and often I've not had a single customer by 10 but I can't just walk away.I keep hoping it will go back to how it was but I don't think it will."Image caption Lesley McDonald fears the town will never go back to its heyday Image caption The old M&S store has been boarded-up since August while the BHS, two doors down, closed in 2016 Marks and Spencer, like many others, was lured away to the 140m Rushden Lakes retail park, which opened 15 miles east of Northampton in 2017.The retailer's move prompted local celebrity and broadcaster the Reverend Richard Coles to describe the town centre as "decaying".On Abington Street - Northampton's main thoroughfare - about a third of units are vacant and many of the entrances now occupied by homeless people in tents.The M&S shop has been empty since August and is now boarded up.BHS, which closed in 2016, has only recently been occupied by a factory outlet store, while House of Fraser closed in 2014.Now, the future of the nearby Debenhams branch is uncertain.It has agreed a 200m refinancing lifeline with lenders but said it would continue with plans to cut the number of its stores.What's happening on the UK High Street?Each year, more shops close than open in the UK and the gap is getting wider.According to figures from PWC and the Local Data Company, 2,692 shops shut in the first half of 2018 - about 14 per day - while 1,569 opened, a net loss of 1,123.That compared with a net loss of 222 in the same six months of 2017.Clothes shops and pubs were the biggest casualties.In January 2008 the internet accounted for 5p in every 1 of retail sales.By August 2018, it was 18p in every pound.In 2018, 43 retailers with multiple stores either closed or went into administration, affecting 2,594 shops and 46,000 jobs according to the Centre for Retail Research.A further 15, with 266 stores and 2,706 employees, did so by the end of February 2019.Life-long resident Jacqueline, 69, says the town's heyday was between the 1960s and 1990s, when the atmosphere was "tremendous".Now she comes into the town centre not to shop, but to drop some paperwork off at the council."The town centre is a mess.Ask anyone born and bred in Northampton and they'll tell you the same."I don't come in very often.Mostly just to catch a bus to the shops in Milton Keynes."Image caption Halymah Agboola says she rarely ventures into Northampton Image caption Jacqueline misses Northampton's "tremendous" atmosphere and shops elsewhere these days Northampton is not only competing with online retailers and Rushden Lakes, but larger towns nearby with a greater selection of shops.Milton Keynes, for example, is a 15-minute train journey away and has a Marks and Spencer, House of Fraser and a John Lewis.You might also be interested in The city with no homeless on its streets The last man standing on the Calf of Man Things Bradford gave the world "Big towns and cities can attract the crowds and be a destination for a day out, while smaller centres [offer] convenience," says Kardi Somerfield, senior marketing lecturer at the University of Northampton."So mid-range towns are particularly and disproportionally affected by store closures."Image copyright Leon Neal/Getty Image caption Northampton is home to about 210,000 people and is an hour north of central London by train Student Halymah Agboola rarely ventures into Northampton's centre."It's probably about once a fortnight to look for clothes.There are much better deals and discounts for students online and it's just less hassle," says the 22-year-old."A lot of students I know are going into the centre regularly to pubs and clubs.But I'm not sure what else would attract young people into town and city centres."Perhaps the answer lies in St Giles Street, which runs adjacent to Abington Street.It features a range of small, independent businesses from barbers to restaurants and - despite a handful of empty units - feels altogether more prosperous.Lisa Witham, 29, runs the Dreams Coffee Lounge with her sister, Nina Neophitou, 25.She says the key to the street's success is simple."There's a lot of lovely independent shops all offering different experiences for customers, rather than the generic High Street shops."The experience for the customer is important.Offer something a bit different that online and out-of-town retailers can't."Image copyright Lisa Witham Image caption Cafe owner Lisa Witham, right, and sister Nina Neophitou, say it is important to focus on customer experience Steve Ward and his wife Caroline run St Giles Cheese, which also sells locally produced gin."Abington Street is just the classic, dying High Street isn't it?You're losing all these big names, one after another," says Steve.Northampton Borough Council has made efforts to revitalise the town centre.According to some, progress has been slow, but a new board has been created to tackle some of the the town's long-standing issues of shop closures and poor footfall.The board, called Northampton Forward and comprising public and private-sector organisations, has already expressed an interest in bidding for a slice of the government's 620m Future High Streets Fund in order to improve areas including the Market Square and a section of Abington Street.And after being awarded 215,000 in central government funding, the council has also created five new positions, including a specialist mental health worker, to help reduce rough sleeping."We know the town has some problems, particularly the centre which is suffering through a combination of factors," says council leader Jonathan Nunn."The primary aim of this new board is to ensure everyone is pulling in the same direction to address those issues and allow the town to live up to its promise."Image caption Efforts have been made to highlight Northampton's arts and heritage offerings A slew of new cafes and restaurants have breathed life into the town centre area and there has been a flurry of regeneration work around the newly designated Cultural Quarter.It is home to the Royal and Derngate Theatre which recently kicked off the UK tour of Kinky Boots - a nod to the town's shoemaking heritage, based on the story of a struggling Northampton shoe factory.Nearby, the town's museum, which is currently closed for a major refurbishment, is due to reopen next year.And the University of Northampton's new 330m campus, which opened in September, brought some 12,000 students and 2,000 staff to the area.Signs of progress mean many businesses are cautiously optimistic about the future, with caveats."There needs to be more support from the council and landlords, making sure we get the right businesses in," says Lisa."There needs to be variety with the retail, with leisure options such as bowling or maybe an arcade.We have students nearby but they need an incentive to come into town."But the more empty units there are, the more difficult it is to attract new businesses.It's easy to get into a downward spiral."
Minimum wage: How high could the lowest salaries go?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK's lowest-paid workers are about to get a pay rise - the result of an increase in the minimum wage on Monday.Since it was introduced in 1999, the minimum wage has risen much faster than average pay.The government is considering what to do after 2020 and further rises are possible.What happens affects everyone from bar staff to waiters to nursery nurses and sales assistants.So, is there a limit to how much they could be paid?And what are the benefits and risks of paying more?How high is the minimum wage?The UK has one of the world's highest minimum wages.For workers aged 25 and over, it is now known as the National Living Wage and rises to 8.21 an hour when they return to work on 1 April.This is 59% of the hourly rate of 14 per hour earned by those on the median (middle) wage.The minimum wage has increased by 50% over the past 20 years, after adjusting for inflation, compared with 15% for those on an average wage.It is now paid to 1.6 million people aged 25 and over, up from only 700,000 in 1999.This is because the minimum wage is now a greater proportion of average pay.Lower minimum wage rates for about 230,000 under-25s range from 4.35 to 7.70 and have not risen as fast.Only four industrialised countries - France, Portugal, New Zealand and Australia - had a higher minimum hourly wage (as a proportion of average salaries) than the UK in 2017, the last year for which figures are available.Some wealthy countries have much lower minimum wages, including the US, Spain and Japan.However, many countries - including Italy and Sweden - are not included because they do not have a minimum wage.Who benefits from a higher minimum wage?The obvious reason for having a higher minimum wage is to boost the pay of those with low hourly pay.In the UK, this often includes cleaners, hairdressers, carers and kitchen assistants.More than six out of 10 people on the minimum wage work part-time.A similar number are women, and almost nine out of 10 work in the private sector.Boosting their wages may also help those on slightly more pay: employers often have to maintain different wages between different jobs.However, while raising the minimum wage is often seen as a way to reduce poverty, it is not that simple.Only one in five of those on the lowest wages lives in the UK's poorest households.This may be because many people on low incomes have a partner who earns more - raising their household income to a higher level.Many of the very poorest people are not affected by the minimum wage.This may be because they are out of work, or because they are self-employed.And on its own, a higher minimum wage will not necessarily lift many people out of poverty.This is particularly true if they have a high cost of living, for example because of having children or high housing costs.More like this What are the risks of a higher minimum wage?Given that minimum wages benefit low-paid workers, why not keep on raising them?First, unless higher wages make workers more productive, they come at a cost.That could mean increasing prices paid by consumers, cutting profits for companies, or cutting wages for other workers.Second, there is a risk that higher minimum wages might lead employers to give fewer people jobs, or to cut hours.But, so far, there is little evidence that higher minimum wages have reduced employment levels.This might be because for many firms it is still profitable to hire these workers, despite paying higher salaries.Minimum wage rates from 1 April National Living Wage - for 25-year-olds and over: 8.21 an hour Minimum wage - 21 to 24-year-olds: 7.70 an hour Minimum wage - 18 to 20-year-olds: 6.15 an hour Minimum wage - 16 to 17-year-olds: 4.35 an hour Apprentice rate: 3.90 an hour The charity the Living Wage Foundation says the wage level needed to "meet the costs of living" is 9 across the UK and 10.55 in London However, at some point, if raised high enough, firms would lose money by employing someone on a high minimum wage.The trouble is that we do not know exactly how high these salaries can go before they lead to a reduction in the number of jobs available.And, with few countries offering higher minimum wages than the UK, it is difficult to look for the answer overseas.For governments wanting to increase wages for those on the lowest pay, the best approach may be to do things bit by bit.Monitoring what happens will be essential to avoid unwanted consequences.About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Jonathan Cribb is a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which describes itself as an independent research institute that aims to inform public debate on economics.More details about its work can be found here and on Twitter.Edited by Duncan Walker
Life after a devastating mining disaster:::::Image caption "My caf was my dream.I don't know what will happen to it now," says Geruza Frana It was a slow, rainy Saturday summer evening and tourists were beginning to fill up restaurants and cafs in Macacos, a beautiful district in the valleys of Minas Gerais State.Suddenly the evening calm was broken by the spine-chilling announcement from warning sirens."Attention, this is a real emergency.A dam has just broken, evacuate immediately from your homes, follow the exit route to a safe place and wait for further instructions."The whole place went into panic mode as tourists and residents got into their cars and clogged the town's narrow streets.Some left all of their belongings behind.Just two weeks earlier, in neighbouring Brumadinho, an earth embankment tailings dam operated by Brazilian mining giant Vale had broken, killing 308 people.It was the worst industrial disaster in Brazil's history.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tributes to victims of the Brumadinho dam collapse at an iron-ore mine in Minas Gerais state Everyone in Macacos thought the same thing was about to happen.False alarm But it was a false alarm.Vale had detected a problem in the dams and decided to sound the alert, but the dams hadn't actually been breached.Fortunately no lives were lost, but Macacos has still been affected.This had been a paradise-like district for wealthy tourists, with high-end restaurants and elegant hotels.It used to be fully booked all year, but now that everybody is more aware of the tailings dams in the area, nobody wants to come here.Hotel reservations have been cancelled and its most prestigious restaurant has shut down.I visited Macacos just after Carnival week, which is usually the busiest time of the year.Most residents in lower-lying areas have had to abandon their homes.Among the few still left are business owners.But they don't know whether to wait for things to change or restart their lives and businesses elsewhere.Image caption Tourists have stopped coming to Macacos since the Brumadinho disaster "Our economy is over, business owners will not be able to make a living any more.All the peace and quiet we had of waking up in a safe place, is gone," Geruza Frana, who owns Caf Judith, tells me.All her savings from years of working in Europe were put into her caf and properties around Macacos."My caf was my dream.I don't know what will happen to it now.I keep thinking: did I lose my entire dream overnight?It's like someone came and snatched it all away."Leonardo Batista, who runs the Pousada Kumaru hostel, argues that most of the district is on higher ground and would not be affected by any dam break, but he doesn't know whether businesses will be able to convince the tourists to come back.Safety 'revolution' Macacos is one of dozens of districts and towns in Brazil's Minas Gerais state that are feeling the effects of the Brumadinho tragedy.Image caption "Now what Vale?"asks this sign in Macacos In the aftermath of the disaster, mining practices are finally being overhauled.Vale and other firms, alongside local authorities, are working to eliminate the risks of further tragedies by decommissioning 50 tailings dams - draining the water from them.After years of inaction, things are now moving.I recently visited five such dams in Minas Gerais and saw work being done in all but one.But there are economic consequences as well.The work will take three years to finish and mining activity is being severely disrupted, with Vale having to halt production in some mines.Having unsafe mining would be catastrophic; having no mining at all is economically devastating."We don't want Vale to stop mining here but we don't want to be the ones to pay for their problems," says mayor of Itabirito, Alex Salvador.In his town, 65% of its revenues come from Vale operations that have now stopped due to court orders.He is already having to plan cuts in education, health and public cleaning.Image caption Alex Salvador: "We don't want Vale to stop mining here but we don't want to pay for their problems."On top of that there are safety concerns.Should the two dams near Itabirito break, the town would be hit within a few hours.Just a few days after Brumadinho, the town's authorities came up with an evacuation plan.Itabirito now has signs pointing to escape routes and meeting points on high ground.Warning sirens will be installed next month.Global consequences The problems of Minas Gerais and Vale are not just affecting local economies.Global iron ore prices have soared since January, as Vale is the world's number one producer - and Minas Gerais state accounts for 45% of its iron ore output.Iron ore was trading at $74 a tonne before Brumadinho.It reached $95 a tonne immediately afterwards and is now about $85 a tonne.Analysts say prices will remain high for some months, as many questions remain.How much will Vale have to pay in compensation and fines?Will new mining regulations increase production costs?In a few months, these disruptions will start pushing up the costs of steel and construction worldwide.Yet because Vale is such a powerful player in global commodities, it is actually benefiting financially from this supply disruption.Immediately after the disaster it saw some $19bn wiped off its share value.But as no other firm has the capability to take over Vale's market share, the iron ore price rise is now working to its advantage.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mud from the Vale dam collapse - iron ore prices have soared since the disaster Even with drastic production cuts, Vale shares are now at the same level as they were shortly before the tragedy, increasing the anger felt by communities claiming reparation from the firm.Stricter control One thing is virtually unanimous amongst iron ore experts: Brazil needs stricter control of its mining practices, and decommissioning the tailings dams is a matter of urgency.Brazilian authorities are still investigating the causes of the Brumadinho tragedy.Some Vale executives have been arrested and questioned, but no one has yet been charged.Earlier this month Vale's chief executive Fabio Schvartsman stepped down after a disastrous appearance in Congress where he told MPs that "Vale is a Brazilian jewel" and "should not be condemned" for what he described as "an accident".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Vale's Fabio Schvartsman was forced to step down after a disastrous press conference Vale executives declined a BBC request for an interview.In a statement the company said it is "100% focused on supporting those affected and responding to the dam break".Apart from decommissioning mines, Vale has made donations to those affected and organising relocation for those in areas at risk.Back in Macacos, where local business owners are desperately looking for answers from Vale, there is still much anger and little faith in the company.Geruza Frana is now thinking about closing down her caf.What she can't understand is how such a powerful company caused so much destruction in so many people's lives."How can these executives behave like this?I don't think they are made of flesh and blood.I think they are made of iron ore."
Shanghai Fashion Week: UK brands battle for China's growing market:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Models wear designs by Caroline Hu, winner of the Business of Fashion (BoF) China Prize 2019 held during Shanghai Fashion Week Over the next week Shanghai Fashion Week will fill the city with models, designers and buyers.The show is becoming a key route into China but the lucrative market remains difficult to navigate.London-based fashion designer Roksanda Ilincic says she admires the adventurous spirit of her Chinese customers.They're experimental with a taste for clothes that are "vibrant and sculptural yet feminine", she adds."The Chinese market really resonates with those parts of my DNA."For the first time Ms Ilincic is taking part in Shanghai Fashion Week, joining a wave of other foreign brands in search of exposure and crucial business contacts.Observers say Shanghai Fashion Week, which runs until 3 April, buzzes with young talent and commercial potential.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Designer Qiu Shuting (right) dresses a model in her Shuting Qiu collection at the BoF China prize in Shanghai Launched in 2003, it's not one of the top four shows - London, Paris, New York and Milan - but its importance has grown alongside China's economic rise."In Asia, there's an emerging market where lots of the money is spent on Shanghai," says Tianwei Zhang of Women's Wear Daily (WWD) .Many will skip Tokyo's fashion week in favour of Shanghai "because there's more money here", he adds.Last year, a report by consultancy Bain showed that Chinese spending accounted for one-third of the global luxury market - itself worth 260bn euros ($292bn; 223bn).In 2018, the country's luxury goods market posted its second straight year of 20% growth, Bain said.Western brands have long eyed the potential of China's growing middle class, seeking to find their way into the lucrative - but sheltered - market.Securing business partners and buyers is crucial.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A McKinsey-BoF report said China will overtake the US as the world's largest fashion market in 2019 The British Fashion Council (BFC) is one group helping UK designers make inroads in China - from finding a space, to negotiating contracts or licensing arrangements.BFC chief executive Caroline Rush says that while businesses can do it alone "the norm is to go in with a Chinese partner".The group is in Shanghai this week to build its network.It wants to plug into independent retailers across China that reach their customers through social platforms like WeChat and Weibo, and often sell through those channels directly."We're also looking at partners that can help them open retail stores and the big e-commerce players that can help them in terms of mass distribution," Ms Rush says.The BFC is hosting a trade showcase with Roksanda Ilincic and Peter Pilotto in Shanghai, two brands Ms Rush describes as part of London's "new guard".Image copyright British Fashion Council Image caption Vogue China editor in chief Angelica Cheung with fashion investor and chief executive of Yu Holdings Wendy Yu at Shanghai Fashion Week From buyers to fashion writers, industry figures routinely say Chinese consumers are drawn to the "creativity" of British design.Among them is Yvonne Gan, chief executive of The Balancing, a chain of Shanghai boutiques, which sell top names including Britain's Stella McCartney, Victoria Beckham and Anya Hindmarch.Ms Gan says 40% of total investment in the latest collections was spent on British brands.Chinese labels accounted for just 5%: "Local design is not as creative as British designers [and] also quality is not comparable."Still, British firms are competing in a crowded market, trying to please the Chinese consumer - and not all of them get it right.A high-profile stumble from Dolce & Gabbana over an ad campaign widely seen as offensive led to a severe backlash in China with several retailers pulling the firm's products.Meanwhile, Burberry drew some criticism for missing the mark over its latest Chinese New Year campaign.Other British brands have struggled to gain traction in China.Marks & Spencer left the market in 2017, New Look withdrew last year and Topshop has had troubles with local partners.Image copyright British Fashion Council Image caption Yoyo Liu, with designer Roksanda Ilincic, Yvonne Ching, Mia Kong at Shanghai Fashion Week Irene Yu, senior director of merchandising at Chinese accessories retailer Pedder Group says Chinese consumers are "very fashion savvy"."They are sophisticated, well-travelled and demanding in quality and newness."Pricing is also a concern.While wealth is rising, hefty import taxes drive the cost of Western luxury labels beyond the reach of many."British fashion designers are still at a slightly higher price point," WWD's Mr Zhang says.He says while spending power is rising, Chinese consumers are not yet as willing to spend on designer clothes as they are on shoes and accessories.The competitive threat from local talent is also mounting.There are big names like Angel Chen and Shushu/Tong, along with emerging designers like Caroline Hu and 8on8, all set to gain plenty of attention in Shanghai."There are more and more upcoming Chinese designers taking the international stage," says Pedder Group's Ms Yu."They give a fresh perspective."
Should Google, Amazon and Facebook fear this woman?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Presidential hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren thinks the tech giants have become too powerful US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren says she'd consider dismantling the tech giants should she ever get the top job.But is this really necessary or even possible?A growing chorus of people think the big beasts of the tech world - Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon - are getting too big for their boots and should be dismantled.But as Prof. Harry First, an expert in competition law at New York University, says: "Breaking up is hard to do", recalling the old Neil Sedaka song.So what should be done?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Is the dominance of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon good or bad for us?Critics say these US-based behemoths dominate the marketplace, use their hugely popular platforms to prioritise their own products and services, and seem perennially able to evade the discipline of most regulators.Concerns are growing that social media platforms such as Facebook and Google-owned YouTube are becoming havens for malicious users spreading illegal, false or terrorist-related content.And the European Union (EU) in particular has criticised big tech firms for not paying enough tax.In March, the EU hit Google with a 1.49bn (1.28bn) fine for blocking rival online search advertisers.It's the third large fine the EU has handed Google in two years.The total bill now stands at more than 9bn.Skip Twitter post by @BBCSimonJack Google now been fined a total of over EUR 9 billion in last 2 years by the European Commission.That's very nearly the UK's annual net EU budget contribution.Simon Jack (@BBCSimonJack) March 20, 2019 Report But, as many point out, even if Google ever pays the bill, it's a relatively small slice of the company's cash reserves, which currently exceed $100bn (76bn).Those who advocate breaking up big companies argue that smaller firms competing with one another on a relatively level playing field will give consumers more choice.Increased competition, the argument goes, also makes firms less inclined to behave badly.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager recently imposed another big fine on Google Take supermarkets as an example.Price competition is fierce, consumers can shop around for good deals, and new players can enter the market - think of Lidl and Aldi when they arrived in the UK.Competition authorities don't like it when big companies merge to the detriment of consumer choice, which is why Sainsbury's and Asda are finding it so hard to get their proposed tie-up past the UK's Competition and Markets Authority.Big tech, however, is a different kettle of fish.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Sainsbury's Asda merger isn't yet in the bag, but tech firms aren't like supermarkets "As it stands, it is difficult for users to switch between platforms," notes the MIT Digital Currency Initiative and the Center for Civic Media, "and most mega-platforms do not interoperate".In other words, once you've bought into them, you're stuck.And then there's all the data they've collected - gargantuan stores of information about our likes, dislikes, shopping habits, music and entertainment preferences, search habits and so on.It's a hugely valuable resource to which few have access.Some think mega companies become "too big to innovate" and simply snaffle up ground-breaking start-ups."This is why Facebook couldn't invent Instagram - they needed to resort to buying them up," says Prof Howard Yu at IMD Business School in Switzerland.Alphabet - Google's parent company - has bought more than 200 firms, for instance.And Simon Bryant at market research firm Futuresource says he often has conversations with smaller companies who regularly see their ideas repackaged by the giants, who of course already have access to a large consumer base."On the one hand they want to work with them, on the other hand they find it very difficult to compete," he says.Amazon is often cited as the bogeyman of the traditional High Street, responsible for book, fashion and music shop closures.But Sam Dumitriu from The Entrepreneurs Network, a think tank, argues that tech disruptors can shake up established markets to the benefit of consumers.For example, when Amazon bought Whole Foods, the bricks-and-mortar grocery business, retailing giant Walmart was forced to rethink its home delivery strategy as a result - teaming up with Uber, Lyft and Postmates, for example."Suddenly users in the US had better access to home delivery of foods," says Mr Dumitriu: "It benefits consumers."But even if you do think breaking up big tech is the way forward, Prof First says your options are sorely limited.US competition law makes it very hard for courts to find a legal basis on which to justify splitting up a large company, he explains.If there is evidence of bad behaviour then a judge could conceivably make such a demand.But companies can promise to "fix" the bad behaviour and move on.That's more or less what happened 20 years ago, when a US judge ordered that Microsoft be split in two.It never happened.Partly because Microsoft agreed to make changes so that competitors could more easily integrate their software with Windows.Image copyright New York University Image caption Prof Harry First warns that breaking up the tech giants could be harder than Ms Warren thinks "Trying to fix them may be better than not trying, but you can't go into this thinking we have some sort of magic wand," says Prof First.He argues that making the tech giants' data available to competitors might be one way to curb their increasing power.Google's huge map databases could be licensed to other companies seeking to make their own map-based apps, for example.These start-ups might fail, or come up with something significantly better and more innovative, he says.This is a similar approach to that recommended in a recent UK government report on competitiveness in the digital economy.Rather than advocating the break-up of big companies, its author Jason Furman suggests that they be forced to allow consumers to port their personal data to competing firms.Don't like how Facebook is running things?Simply request that your data be ported to your new social network of choice.More Technology of Business And Prof Yu has another idea.In a region like Europe, which is well placed to apply some investigative pressure to foreign companies, why not subject big tech firms to audits of their algorithms, a bit like how banks' accounts are audited regularly?Prof Yu says that there are plenty of capable data scientists in the EU who, were they allowed access, could make sure that big tech wasn't unfairly prioritising its own services within its platforms, or locking away and misusing people's personal data."It's not really breaking them up, you just scrutinise them," he says.So, like a doctor dealing with a nervous patient, the regulator could firmly insist: "Don't worry, it's for your own good."And, indeed, for ours.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Mobile barbering: 'It's like Uber, but for haircuts':::::Image copyright Other For many black British men, barber shops are a place to hang out, chat and meet friends.But for others they waste too much time, which is why two young men have come up with a new approach - a barber shop on wheels that you book via an app.A van painted in bright colours drives slowly down a leafy, residential road in Norwood, south London.A young man in the front garden of a house, clutching a phone, waves at the driver, who parks nearby.They shake hands, then the driver pulls back the sliding door of the van.This reveals a sparkling, silver barber's chair, a large mirror, a hair dryer and pots filled with a variety of scissors.The young man hops in and puts on an apron, syncing his phone to the speakers to get some music playing.The driver - who is now his barber - gets to work with his electric clippers in the tight space.The door is still wide open to let in sunlight.A woman walking her dog along the pavement does a double take, craning her neck back in disbelief."My service is like Deliveroo, or Uber Eats, but instead of delivering food, we deliver haircuts," explains Darren Tenkorang, 24, co-founder of Trim-It.He currently has two vans buzzing around south London and another in the north-west of the city.Darren is confident he's on to something."Male grooming is a super-important part of my culture," he says.But in a van?Yes, he says."My generation really values convenience above all else, you see."Darren grew up in Brixton, south London, where his mother worked as a cleaner and his father as a security guard; they had arrived from Ghana in the 1980s and had dreams of him becoming a banker, lawyer or accountant.University was always part of the plan for him, but when the time came, he wasn't sure which one would feel right.It was a barber shop that helped him decide."It sounds silly, but the fact that there was an Afro-Caribbean black barber immediately when I got out the railway station at Brighton, to visit the University of Sussex, made me think instantly, 'I could be OK here, I could feel at home,'" Darren says.Afro-Caribbean hair is different from European hair and it takes some expertise to cut it well.Darren found he usually got better results with barbers who specialised in it."I actually prefer it if a regular hairdresser admits they don't know how to do my hair," he says."I've had a few bad haircuts when someone is too polite to say 'no', and the results can be terrible."Studying Business Management at Sussex, he got a one-year placement at a re-insurance firm in London - just the kind of thing his parents wanted for him.But while he was there he realised something that made him think hard about his future.He is dyslexic.Initially it was just a hunch, but Darren sought a professional opinion, and the diagnosis was confirmed.When he told his parents, his mother said she'd known since he was at primary school, but hadn't mentioned it."She thought if I knew it might hold me back," says Darren.Darren reassessed his career plans."I became worried about all the big numbers that would be flashing around in the corporate world," he says.So he decided to make his own way as an entrepreneur.Immediately he set up his first venture.It was a digital platform that used an algorithm to match clients' personalities with all kinds of tutoring services - it quickly folded.The following year he entered the StartUp Sussex enterprise competition for student entrepreneurs.He decided to work on an idea he was passionate about: male grooming.Image caption As a teenager Darren got his hair cut in traditional salons like this Afro-Caribbean barber shops are well-known for offering a social, convivial atmosphere - a place to hang out with friends."My dad used to take me to the barber's in the morning and we'd be there for hours," says Darren."We'd watch the football, and he would usually sip a pint of Guinness, chilling with his boys."Darren had enjoyed those times.But as he got older he became increasingly frustrated with the slow tempo of the experience."I got sick of waiting for an hour at the barber, especially on a Friday or Saturday," he says.Or it would be your turn next in the queue, and then the barber would go to eat, or to pick up a child, he remembers.There was a special feeling of community, but perhaps that was more necessary for the generation before his, he wondered."The new generation, like me, just want a trim and to get on with their day," says Darren."We live our life fast-paced."And so the idea came to him of an app that would allow you to book an appointment at a salon for a fixed time with a specific barber.He thought this would appeal to everyone, not just those who use Afro-Caribbean barbers.Indeed some apps were already offering a similar service.He included within his proposal an idea that seemed to him slightly far-fetched.He would eventually like to employ barbers directly, who would drive to clients in a van: mobile barber shops on wheels.Image caption Darren met business partner Nana Darko while at University of Sussex Darren's Trim-It app won the competition, and he was named the University of Sussex's Student Entrepreneur of the Year.The prize was 10,000.To get his company up and running, he recruited a rival from the competition, a fellow student called Nana Darko, whose confident air had impressed him.Darren promised to make Nana rich.He was similar to him, a young black man from south London with dreams of business success.Together they pounded the streets of Brighton, signing up barbers to their new app - all barbers, not just the Afro-Caribbean ones.Through hard work they built the app to the point where it was getting 2,000 bookings a month.But at the same time, the idea and the fledgling business were unravelling, says Darren.There were constant problems with barbers not turning up on time at the salon.Negative customer feedback was building up.They also hadn't figured out how to make any money from the platform.In 2017, Darren left Brighton and took a full-time job with a multinational company that specialises in sports betting, while trying to keep Trim-It going in his spare time.The competition money had dried up and the app seemed ready to die a natural death in the app store."Self-doubt and a bruised ego had become something I was used to dealing with," he admits.Nana too was feeling bitterly disappointed.He had graduated with a first in engineering.But he was missing out at dozens of job interviews in the corporate world and he couldn't figure out why.Was it the way he presented himself, the way he talked, or perhaps the colour of his skin?It was at this low point that Darren and Nana decided to take a risk.They would focus on the side of the business that had at first seemed so implausible and try the idea of mobile barber vans - only this would allow them to control the whole customer experience.Image caption Kris is a full-time barber, operating from the van Through family and friends they were able to raise a five-figure sum in a last-ditch attempt to jump-start the business and in February 2018 the first van was ready - a Ford transit Darren customised outside his parents' house.The back of the van was all stripped out, to turn it into a mini-barber shop, powered by an electric generator.They recruited two full-time barbers, updated the app and waited for the bookings to come in.Very quickly those bookings arrived.In fact by July 2018 the van was permanently fully booked.Word spread partly due to some celebrity customers such as musicians Charlie Sloth and Sneakbo, who both have hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram and Twitter.As Darren and Nana had intended, the kind of people making the bookings were mostly young, black millennials - people like Lewis, from West Norwood."If I was 15 or 16, then I'd go to a barbershop," says Lewis."But I'm 23, managing properties and working part-time, so I don't have time to go to a salon and wait for my turn."He might miss some of the banter in a typical Afro-Caribbean salon, but if he feels like company he can invite friends into the back of the van where there is a small bench for them to sit on, he says.Buoyed by the early interest, Darren was able to sign up more investors, allowing the team to raise a six-figure sum.Around the same time it was becoming clear that there was a shortage of barbers catering to Afro-Caribbean people in parts of London with large numbers of well-paid workers."We're finding that because there is a bigger black middle class and there's more people working in the City, that we have pockets of customers there," Darren says.The van also turned out to be attractive to a new generation of black middle-class professionals looking for a haircut while working in trendy areas such as Old Street, Bethnal Green and Shoreditch.In the first year, about half of the van's business came in this way, says Darren.As of this week, there are three vans in operation.The increasing number of black professionals may mean that the relatively high cost of a Trim-It cut - 25 - is not an obstacle to growth.But there are others.Image copyright Trim-It Image caption The service has also attracted some white and Asian customers One obvious problem is parking.When visiting residential areas, customers often provide tips on where to park, to avoid getting a ticket.It can be easier in the evenings, when parking is free of charge.But to cut hair in working hours in central London, the team has to find a place where they can park for a short period free of charge - no mean feat - or pay for a spot.The difficulty of reaching customers in different parts of the city, bearing in mind London's traffic problems, is expected to reduce if and when more vans come on stream, each serving a smaller area.But there is also the problem of climate change - will young clients continue to feel comfortable having their hair cut in a van that runs on fossil fuels.And of course many people in the black community still feel a strong emotional attachment to the barber shop, which was such an important meeting place for first generation immigrants.Lawrence Agyemang works at a barber shop in Oval, south London, where Darren had his hair cut as a teenager.Image caption Lawrence used to cut Darren's hair when the entrepreneur was a teenager "Young guys still want to hang out here in front of the shop, to show off their new hair styles," he says.And older people come even when they don't really need a haircut, he says, to socialise, watch sport, or just share a joke.Darren says that if his parents, 20 years ago, had thought their son would go into the barber shop business, they would have been "horrified".But if he can overhaul the barbering business, he thinks he might just make them proud."Mobile barbershops will be a thing, trust me," he says.Follow journalist Dougal Shaw on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc You may also be interested in: Gina Atinuke Knight's white mum loved her, but her childhood in a white family meant it took her years to embrace her blackness.Her hair was one of the first things she came to love, which is why she became a hair blogger and wig-maker.Join the conversation -

official figures show that more than 28 million do not - others like Melissa go overseas because their basic cover means that they have to pay a sizeable chunk of any treatment bill.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Costa Rica is not famous for the quality of its healthcare provision She says that her knee operation in Clinica Biblica, Costa Rica's largest private hospital, cost $12,200 (9,200), compared with around $44,000 in the US.Patients Beyond Borders, a publisher of guidebooks for "medical tourists" estimates that more than 20 million people will travel to another country for medical treatment this year, up 25% from 16 million last year.Meanwhile, a 2016 report by payments giant Visa estimated that the medical tourism industry was worth $50bn a year, and continuing to grow.Yet before people in the UK feel relieved about having the National Health Service, with its free at the point of delivery service, more and more Britons are also going abroad for treatment.This is more often so they can avoid waiting lists, get cosmetic surgery that is not covered by the NHS, or for dental work due to a lack of NHS dentists.Medigo, a German-based medical travel company says that queries from UK residents jumped 53% last year.Official figures from the UK's Office of National Statistics also show that a rising number of people are going abroad for treatment.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some UK citizens go abroad for treatment because of NHS waiting lists One British person who recently travelled abroad for surgery was Amanda Wells, from the Scottish town of Dalkeith, near Edinburgh.The 46-year-old travelled to Poland last year - via Medigo - to have a painful bunion removed from her left foot, because she didn't want to wait the nine months that her GP estimated it would take her to get the operation on the NHS.She says she was able to get the work done in Poland for 3,000, half the amount she was quoted by a private surgeon in the UK.Image copyright Amanda Wells Image caption Amanda Wells went to Poland for a foot operation "I did my research regarding waiting times to meet with a [NHS] surgeon, and I discovered that my GP was being optimistic," she says."The facilities were excellent in Poland.The surgeon was fantastic and I saw him for three follow-ups before I went home."Another Briton who went abroad for treatment last year was Lincoln Summers, of Woking, south west of London.He went to a dentist in Hungary."I looked like a mobster after one of my front teeth broke off," says the 54-year-old.Lincoln says he got an implant fitted in Budapest for 800 compared with the 2,500 he was quoted by a private UK dentist."It was not what I expected at all [in Hungary], it was a state-of-the-art dentist," he adds.While both Lincoln, Amanda - and Melissa in the US - say they were very happy with the medical care they received, some experts urge medical tourists to be cautious.Especially if people are travelling to the developing world."People go abroad thinking they are going to get affordable care... and they get back to the States and end up having massive medical bills because they require treatment of infections, and they require additional surgery," says Prof Leigh Turner, from the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota."If they have insurance, their insurance doesn't cover it.It ends being a costly experience."Image copyright Lincoln Summers Image caption Lincoln Summer says he is happy to show off his teeth again Despite this risk, the number of Americans going abroad for medical treatment goes up every year.About 422,000 did so in 2017, according to the US National Travel and Tourism Office.That is up from 295,383 in 2000."The number of uninsured Americans began to climb again in 2017," says Prof Turner."And... it seems plausible that reductions in insurance coverage are pushing more Americans to search elsewhere for affordable medical care."Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Josef Woodman, chief executive of Patients Without Borders, says that much of the growth in global health tourism is coming from people in the developing world."You have got literally hundreds of millions of people entering the middle class in China, in India, and in Indonesia," he says."The healthcare systems in these countries don't offer them what they need in terms of speciality, complex care."Back in Mississippi, Melissa Moore is continuing to recover from her knee operation in Costa Rica earlier this year.She praises all the staff that treated her."I had a meltdown one day [at the hospital] because of the pain, and the feeling of helplessness," she says."But the nurses and techs were so sweet and helped to calm me."
Can post-industrial towns survive automation?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Some 20 years ago, four million people across the UK worked in manufacturing, but according to the Office for National Statistics that figure has dropped by 30% as new technology replaces jobs.Former coal mining communities, already struggling with high levels of unemployment, have been hardest hit.So much so, that in 2018 think tank the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) identified 10 former manufacturing towns where social deprivation is already high, and jobs are at risk from automation.The 10 post-industrial towns are Doncaster, Wigan, Blackpool, Mansfield, Barnsley, Bradford, Plymouth, Stoke-on-Trent, Wakefield and Dudley.Patrick Spencer from the CSJ says they need to "cultivate a business community that's going to create jobs locally" in order to survive.BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme reports from two of those towns, Doncaster and Wigan, to find out what they're doing to turn things around.Wigan: The home of Heinz Wigan is a former mining town in Greater Manchester with a borough-wide population of more than 300,000.Image copyright Getty Images/Topical Press Agency Image caption Coal production in the Wigan area was at its peak in the late Victorian era It has a higher-than-average number of people working in factories, is above average for workless households, and lower than average for weekly wages.One of its biggest employers, Heinz, opened its factory in Kitt Green in 1959.Since then the speed with which they can make cans has dramatically increased.New can-filling technology means they can produce around one billion cans every year.John Brockley works in the operations team at the factory.He's been with the company for 36 years, after starting as an apprentice when he was 16.Over that time he says that because of new technology, staff numbers have fallen from 3,000 down to around 800 on site.Heinz dealt with the reduction in its workforce by offering good redundancy packages and reinvesting in the site.Mr Brockley accepts there might come a time when his job is no longer needed.Image copyright Heinz Image caption John Brockley has worked for Heinz his whole adult life Offering good redundancy packages is one way of managing change.Another is to try to attract new businesses into these towns.Wigan's Labour-led council has a policy of supporting new business by making sites available for development.Council leader David Molyneux says it is part of a wider plan that includes attracting younger people to the town."We've got to turn out young people who've got the skills to grasp what the 21st Century has to offer," he says."A lot of people go off to university, but I want to make sure that they come back once they've got the skills we need to see Wigan grow."There are some businesses in Wigan that are looking closely at what opportunities new technology can provide.Keytech, a small IT business, is investing in virtual reality as a training tool.The idea is that they'll manage a system where trainees wear a virtual reality headset to learn how to do a job.David Craig from the company says: "That will service many industries from medical, to logistics to field engineers.There will be investment for engineers to manage the virtual reality technology."Listen to the You and Yours Wigan programme.Doncaster and Amazon Doncaster is a former mining town in South Yorkshire with a population of more than 300,000.Image copyright Getty Images/Bert Hardy Image caption Mining in Doncaster has been replaced by a variety of companies in the services sector and light manufacturing It has three Amazon fulfilment centres employing 1,000 staff, one of which is the size of 15 football pitches.There is also an Amazon Pantry warehouse, one of just a few in the UK that uses robots.Wages start at 9.50 per hour.The robots bring pallets to the staff who pick and pack the items.The robots in Amazon warehouses in a number of locations including Doncaster and Dunstable, are controlled by a computer system, and only specially trained staff are allowed inside the floor where the robots are operating.Jane Colquhoun started as a temporary worker after giving up her job as a cleaner.Now she works with the robots as a fulfilment centre staff member.Image caption Jane Colquhoun started as a temporary worker at Amazon "I've been here since it opened three years ago, when we used to walk around with carts," she says."It was before the robots.We don't have to do as much walking around now."It was scary at first.When you see them you think they're going to hit, but they never have."Mark Hemming, Amazon's regional operations director, says that despite introducing the robots the company is employing more people.He says Amazon has added "thousands of jobs year-on-year, at the same time as bringing in technology that helps our employees".Basic roles still exist, but technology can create new training opportunities and jobs, so it doesn't have to mean fewer staff.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers Another worker, Richard Cowlishaw-Ellison, who is from a former mining village, got a temporary job at Amazon after taking voluntary redundancy from a law firm."The firm's now gone," he says."It was a really tough decision for me.One Christmas I ended up working nights [at Amazon].Looking back it was the right decision to make, but there were times when I definitely questioned it."Richard, who now has a permanent job as a senior operations manager, adds: "I guess it's the new conversion to what the mining industry was.It was a big employer back then.Amazon is one of the bigger employers in the region now."Listen to the full Amazon report from You and Yours at 12:30 GMT.What's the government doing?The government has acknowledged the threat automation poses in the north of England.To ensure no region is left behind, it is giving 9bn to Local Enterprise Partnerships to create opportunities for businesses and communities across the country.Image copyright HM Government Image caption A number of Enterprise Zones have sprung up, including in Northampton Since 2012, 48 Enterprise Zones have been established across England, generating more than 38,000 jobs and 3.5bn of private sector

Justice has said that businesses should be given financial support to re-skill workers.
How to create a period-friendly workplace:::::Image caption "Menstruation will always exist, so it's better just to know how to deal with it," says Josefin Eklund A football app start-up in Gothenburg is set to become the first business in Sweden to be certified as menstruation-friendly.But how much do employees really want to talk about their periods?Rows of top-division European football kits hang from a giant goal net hooked to the ceiling, while two male developers kick a ball around on a green fake grass carpet.This isn't the most obvious place to be championing a more supportive environment for women during their periods.Indeed, Forza Football's chief executive Patrik Arnesson admits he "didn't think about the menstrual cycle at all" before a female employee asked if the firm could take part in a pilot scheme designed to break down taboos around menstruation."No one had actually told me they had to leave work to go home because of PMS," he says."And then I actually realized that this is a problem and I haven't even reflected on it."PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, is the name for the symptoms some women experience before their period which can include mood swings, feeling anxious or irritable and tiredness.Headaches or cramps ahead of or during menstruation are also common.But each person's symptoms are different and can vary from month to month.The project in Gothenburg is being led by a non-profit called Mensen (Menses) which was given a grant of 530,000 kronor ($58,400; 44,900) from the Swedish government's Gender Equality Agency at the end of last year.Image caption Women are encouraged to tell others if they choose to be away from the office because of PMS Since March it has started inviting all employees to attend discussions and workshops about the effects of menstruation.These will then be used to form the basis for a certification programme that the organisation wants to see rolled out nationwide or even globally.'Something we have to talk about' Klara Rydstrm, who is leading the project for Mensen, says that while Sweden has a global reputation for supporting women's rights, there is still a stigma around discussing menstruation in many workplaces."But it's something we have to talk about, because it's a bodily function - a normal bodily function - just as being thirsty and you have to have water, or you're hungry and you have to have a lunch break," she argues.Forza Football, which currently has around 60 workers and a 70:30 ratio of male and female employees, has already made several key changes - including providing free sanitary products and bins in company toilets Image caption "I realized this is a problem - and I haven't even reflected on it," says Forza's chief executive Patrik Arnesson And flexible working has been introduced for all staff, so they can pick their own office hours or work from home when they want to.Women are actively encouraged to tell other team members if they choose to be away from the office because of PMS and even to share their cycle dates and symptoms with other team members in advance if they feel comfortable with the idea."I get really sad and lose all my self-confidence and self-esteem.It's kind of hard to do meetings where I need to be focused and positive," says software developer and project manager Lisa Hammarstrm.She says she's felt more relaxed talking about her symptoms since Forza Football started taking part in the Mensen project.Colleagues are happy for her to have a lighter workload when she's premenstrual, she says, because she's very productive during the rest of the month.Image caption "It makes things easier for me if people know what is going on," says Lisa Hammarstrm "I realized that it makes things easier for me if people know what is going on and how it affects your work."What do men think?Account manager Manolo Obaya admits that for some male staff, discussing periods in the workplace has been bit "awkward"."When (women are) hormonal, is that a justification for not delivering on work or whatever?It's hard to me to to say because I've never been in that position," he says, adding that he hopes the project will leave him better informed."I think the value is just making everybody aware that some girls suffer more than others and that we should be trying to be understanding of that particular situation."While Forza Football is currently the only company working towards gaining a formal certification, the media buzz around the project has already spurred other businesses to take similar steps.Several Gothenburg start-ups have recently introduced free sanitary protection and painkillers for employees.Image caption "The value is making everybody aware that some girls suffer more than others," says Manolo Obaya In Stockholm, a PR agency A Perfect Day Media grabbed headlines after mulling the idea of giving female staff the chance to enter their cycle dates in a shared spreadsheet.The project didn't get off the ground, but the company says it is looking at other ways to spark more open discussions about menstruation."The most important thing is that women do not feel we must be silent or ashamed about having our period," says the agency's cofounder Amanda Schulman."We are actively working to ensure that women have the same rights as men, [but] this is not what reality looks like for many women who suffer from PMS, PMDD (a more severe form of PMS) or endometriosis.It is an important battle for us."But while there is clearly a strong movement championing menstrual rights in Sweden, there has also been criticism of these kind of initiatives.Ivar Arpi, a columnist for Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet - currently writing a book about gender ideology - argues that suggesting women might need special treatment dredges up old anti-feminist arguments that men and women aren't equal because "female bodies can't be trusted to work properly for the whole month"."Now you get a 'carte blanche' to act bad and you can blame your menstruation.That's really silly," he argues.Image caption "I don't think that my period is my boss's business," says journalist Linda Norlund For other political commentators, including Linda Norlund who writes for tabloid newspaper Expressen, privacy is a key concern."I don't think that my period is my boss's business frankly, and I think that in the workplace it's important to keep a professional atmosphere and not be too personal."Lack of knowledge Josefin Eklund, who works in Forza Football's branding team, argues that even among educated women there can be a "real lack of knowledge" about PMS and PMDD.She herself struggled with severe headaches and fatigue that she didn't initially attribute to her menstrual cycle."I was always taking two days off a month," she explains."I started to schedule or write down how I was feeling to see if I could find a pattern and eventually I did.I could see it was related to my menstruation.""Menstruation will always exist, so it's better just to know how to deal with it instead of pretending that it's not going on."Image caption There is still a stigma around discussing menstruation, says Mensen's Klara Rydstrm Mensen's Klara Rydstrm says she hopes the project will also encourage men to be more open about their health and wellbeing in the workplace too."It opens up (discussions) for other issues as well related to men's bodies or the work environment in general.So I think it's very applicable to everyone."
Extremism is global education fight, says Blair:::::Image copyright PA Extremism should be treated as a global problem like climate change, says Tony Blair, speaking about the role of education in the wake of the Christchurch mosque shootings.The former UK prime minister said there should be an international agreement to put teaching against extremism into education systems around the world.Mr Blair said it could be in the style of the Kyoto Protocol, where countries committed to an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.As signatories to Kyoto have to answer for environmental pollution, Mr Blair wants governments to be accountable for "spiritual or mental pollution" if they allow young people to be taught a "closed-minded view of the world".Beyond borders Speaking at the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai this week, Mr Blair discussed how education should respond to last month's attacks on mosques in New Zealand, in which 50 people died.Mr Blair told the international education conference that extremism had to be tackled from an international perspective, rather than in terms of individual countries.Image copyright Reuters Image caption A community march in Christchurch in the wake of the mosque attacks "What happens within a country's borders is not just that country's business," said Mr Blair.He called for education systems to actively promote a "tolerant view of the world"."All countries have to do this because everyone has got problems - there is Islamist extremism, right-wing hate speech, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia."Challenging prejudice needed to begin at an early age, he argued."It's often when children are at their youngest that they need to be given this awareness of the way the world is - and helped to think in a way that is open minded from that young age."Counter-terror spending Mr Blair said many education systems needed "vital reform" because "literally millions" of children were being taught in a way that was narrow and closed.He said ducation should be seen as a "security issue" and urged governments to use a greater share of counter-extremism expenditure to "invest in the future of our education systems and our young people".According to the US-based think tank, the Stimson Centre, the US has spent at least $2.8trn (2.1trn) on counter-terrorism efforts since the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001.But programmes to prevent violent extremism, including through education, make up only 0.1% of global spending on counter-terrorism, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, also based in the US.Mr Blair emphasised that investing in education to prevent extremism should be a priority."You've got to deal with the ideology of extremism and not just the consequences," he said.'Global obligation' Teaching young people about tolerance and tackling prejudices was the "only way" to ensure the next generation will be "free of the ideology of extremism", he said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Flowers left in a memorial to the victims of the Christchurch shootings He called for schools to teach young people about critical thinking to equip them with the skills to challenge prejudice."Children need to be able to think critically and part of thinking critically is being open to others," he said, speaking at the education conference run by the Varkey Foundation.An international approach would help governments in countries which "face resistance from small-c conservative elements within their system", he said."If I was back in government today, I would be trying to do what we've done with the environment and climate change."Tackling extremism and promoting respect for different views should be seen as a "global obligation", he said.More from Global education The editor of Global education is Sean Coughlan (sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk).
How a Chinese firm fell victim to intellectual property theft:::::Image caption Frank Liu says his company Intco was the victim of intellectual property theft There was no break in, no hold up.No glass was smashed.But the factory on the outskirts of Shanghai was the scene of a very modern crime.Someone stole a hoard of intellectual property."A couple of years ago one of my IT managers copied ten thousand pages of my entire company's profile," Frank Liu told me.His company Intco has been around for 25 years.He told me the stolen download included "our technology information, our customer list, our purchasing and supply information.Everything."Intco is a business that makes medical devices, skirting boards and photo frames.I visited its offices at a business park in Shanghai, and a factory that sits either side of a tree-lined road south of the city.The company recycles polystyrene waste sent to China from all over the world.Then, using heat moulding and imprinting techniques, it turns it into an array of products which end up on the floors of houses in Brazil or Russia, or hanging on walls displaying photos in the US and Britain."We actually have the record of how he stole it," Mr Liu told me."He just sold it to establish another company, as his investment."Mr Liu feels he has no recourse.He told me he went to the police but nothing happened.He said he still intends to pursue it.His story is increasingly common here, for both local businesses and foreign firms.Top officials from the US and China will hold their next round of trade talks this week and protecting intellectual property (IP) is a key demand for Washington.They argue American and other foreign companies in China have endured decades of theft and infringement.Reacting to pressure China has taken some steps to address the problem.The country only established copyright laws in the 1980s, but things have progressed relatively quickly since then.China now has specialist IP courts, albeit - like every aspect of the judicial system - subservient to the ruling Communist Party.They are supposed to settle cases within 12 to 18 months.Their creation was not due solely to outside pressure from foreign firms.Chinese business figures like Mr Liu have also called for the country's legal system to better protect the innovators and entrepreneurs who have turned China into much more than the "copycat" economy it was once labelled.Benjamin Qiu, an IP lawyer with US law firm Loeb & Loeb, told me that the Chinese are now just as litigious as foreign firms.Foreign firms are just as likely to win a case - a good case, Mr Qiu added - as domestic plaintiffs.In the past few years Lego and New Balance have both won high-profile cases against copycat manufacturers.There is no doubt that the trade war with the US has sped up the pace of reform in China.Image copyright Getty Images President Xi Jinping recently led lawmakers, at their annual gathering in Beijing, in approving new rules for foreign investors.The Foreign Investment Law states that the transfer of technology from foreign investors to any domestic partner must be voluntary.China has always defended this highly contentious practice by insisting it's part of an agreed commercial arrangement.The new law also bars government officials from passing on details of foreign investors IP.A new era?Now though comes the hard part - enforcement.Mr Qiu told me the next step is "detailed regulation coming out after this law, and we want to see actual cases in local courts and also from enforcement agencies."If that follows, then he thinks "potentially the foreign IP owners will have more to protect [them] in China."Both the EU and American Chambers of Commerce welcomed the new law, but both also criticised what they said was ambiguity in the legislation.The Americans also had concerns that it was rushed through without proper consultation.Many foreign companies have been stung over the years in China.Most have found the lure of the massive market, or what was once rock bottom labour costs, irresistible.Some though feel the risk is too high.A fruit industry executive recently told me his firm wanted to buy new conveyor belts for their farms in China, but the European manufacturers said no.They feared their systems would be copied here, and they'd be wiped out.Mr Liu can't do that.He is Chinese and wants to stay in China.But he has taken steps to try to prevent another IP theft.Image caption Production line used to create photo frames at an Intco factory in Shanghai He is chief executive of the company he founded, but this year he told me he's changing his title to include head of research and development.Because he can't trust anyone else with the firms' commercial secrets.Protecting original ideas, techniques and information in China - "it's a human right" he told me.
'The biggest, strangest problem I could find to study':::::Image copyright Andrew Morris Image caption Andrew Morris says about 95% of all background web traffic is malicious Businesses are under siege every second of every day, bombarded by a "grey noise" of potentially harmful web traffic seeking access to their networks.But IT staff often can't tell the malicious traffic from the benign.Why?If your office building were visited thousands of times a day by criminals peering through the windows seeking a way in, you'd be understandably nervous about hanging around.Yet any organisation with an online presence gets exactly this type of unwelcome attention all the time.Security researcher Andrew Morris calls this constant barrage "grey noise" and has started a company of the same name with a mission of logging, analysing and understanding it."This is the biggest, hardest, strangest problem I could find to study," he tells the BBC.He logs the break-in attempts using a network of so-called honey-pot computers scattered around the internet that he has set up.Outwardly these computers resemble run-of-the-mill servers and so attract the attention of the bots and cyber-thieves looking to break in.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Businesses are under siege from a constant barrage of web burglars trying to break in And they attract a lot of attention.In 2018, Mr Morris's network was hit by up to four million attacks a day.His honey-pot computers process between 750 and 2,000 connection requests per second - the exact rate depends on how busy the bad guys are at any given moment.His analysis shows that only a small percentage of the traffic is benign.That fraction comes from search engines indexing websites or organisations such as the Internet Archive scraping sites.Some comes from security companies and other researchers.The rest of the internet's background noise - about 95% - is malicious.It can come from self-propagating computer viruses, known as worms, that use a compromised computer to seek out fresh victims, or can be cyber-criminals looking for servers vulnerable to particular security loopholes.More Technology of Business It can also be dumb devices, from printers to routers, that have been hijacked looking for their kin to enrol them in a vast attack network."There's an absolutely massive amount of traffic that's being generated by all these hosts around the internet and the vast majority is not generated by good guys," says Mr Morris."I see tens of thousands of infections every day."But blocking this tidal wave of troublesome traffic isn't easy.This is because, at first glance, it looks benign.Whenever you access a website your computer first pings a message to it to find out whether it's live.This a standard "handshake" procedure that all legitimate traffic uses.But cyber-thieves have found that if they handshake in the right way they can find out useful information about a target organisation and potentially find a way to get inside.And it's only when anyone takes the time to trace the origin of this traffic that it becomes obvious it is malicious.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Every second of every day business computer networks are under siege "There is a continuous background hum of connections made to systems to see what they are and what they do," says Martin Lee, outreach manager for Cisco's Talos security team in Europe."It's the constant noise of connections just like people rattling door handles and checking locks."Put an unprotected computer on the net and it'll be infected by malware in seconds and possibly enslaved in a botnet army carrying out attacks on other targets."Someone is always trying to hack you," says Mr Lee."It's one of the banal facts of the internet."Given that investigating and blocking is a Herculean task no network administrator wants to take on, the constant rattle is largely ignored, says Dr Paul Vixie, chief executive of Farsight Security and author of some of the net's core addressing software."On the internet, nothing that can be abused will not be," he says.Wading through that vast amount of information makes it very hard for any net administrator to pick out the attacks that matter from the background roar.Instead, they just log it and move on."People do not go into network administration because they like truth and beauty," says Dr Vixie ruefully.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brazil is one of the worst countries for malicious web traffic, says Andrew Morris So Andrew Morris is trying to extract some useful insights from his vast corpus of data, using it to profile bad sources of traffic and spotting patterns in attempted infections.Ultimately it might be used to make a filter that can block the bad stuff.Or one that highlights the really nasty stuff that network administrators do need to notice.He now has a good idea of the dodgiest online neighbourhoods, which seem to be Brazilian and Vietnamese internet service providers (ISPs) who are doing a poor job of protecting their customers.This negligence is allowing the bad guys to get a toehold inside vulnerable machines.These are followed by the cloud-hosting companies.All are strong sources of grey noise, says Mr Morris.Good neighbourhoods are few and far between, though they do exist.One of the most decent is Finland.It has worked hard to ensure that its corner of the net cannot be used as a proxy for attacks.Many cyber-thieves try to cover their tracks by spoofing the origin of the malicious connection request.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Finland has taken great pains to prevent its web addresses from being abused by cyber-criminals Finland has put in place policies, which it polices diligently, to limit the abuse of its domains.A spokesman for Finland's cyber-security centre told the BBC that it has laws and statutes that require ISPs and domain registrars to try as much as possible to limit abuse.It also uses automatic tools that scan for malicious use of Finnish domains - those that end in .fi - and report when the abuse is happening."That is one success factor in making the Finnish internet one of the cleanest ones in the world in terms of malware," he says.Mr Morris' analysis of the traffic coming from the bad neighbourhoods is already starting to reveal interesting and useful patterns.The early signs of massive attacks can be seen long before they start to hit everyone.That has been true of several headline-grabbing events such as those that hit office printers and Google's Chromecast."There's a weaponisation time limit," he says."That's useful to know for defenders to get their stuff patched before they get hit by the bad guys."That means defenders do have time to react - it's not hopeless."Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
'I paid £160 for a pair of limited edition nappies':::::Image copyright Cecilia Leslie / Instagram Think washable nappies, and most of us will envisage a burdensome, time-consuming - not to mention smelly - commitment reserved only for the most dedicated eco-warrior.But, for many a convert, cloth nappies are a hobby, a passion, and even an obsession."Cloth bumming", as it's called in inside circles, is no longer just about the environment or saving money, but also about fashion and the clamour to get the most sought-after designs on your baby's bottom.Some fans collect nappies in the way others amass handbags.Limited editions are snapped up at lightning speed to be posted for resale at nearly 10 times the retail price.Social media communities are flourishing and even have their own lexicon.So what is it about cloth nappies that draws such a cult following?'Not just a frivolous hobby' Image copyright Cecilia Leslie / Instagram Mother-of-four Cecilia Leslie has built up a stash of about 500 nappies.The full-time midwife is now a cloth nappy "influencer" with more than 22,000 Instagram followers.Like the vast majority of "real" nappy users, the 32-year-old from Edinburgh originally set out on her "cloth journey" to reduce plastic waste and save money but, over the years, it became a hobby.Image copyright Cecilia Leslie / Instagram "I fully intended for my use of cloth to be solely functional.But, once I started, it became more of a case of wanting all the pretty patterns.I joined quite a few communities online, where there was a lot of hype about having all the prints."I've got a lot of limited editions, which sell out quickly.It became a bit of a game trying to track them down -

'Muslims don't date, we marry':::::Image copyright Muzmatch Image caption Shahzad Younas came up with the idea for Muzmatch while working in the banking sector The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to Shahzad Younas, founder and chief executive of Muslim dating website and app Muzmatch.When Shahzad Younas took to the stage he was very nervous.It was two years ago, and the then 32-year-old British entrepreneur was in San Francisco pitching London-based Muzmatch to a group of high profile potential investors.He opened his address to the room by saying: "Muslims don't date, we marry."Image copyright Muzmatch Image caption The app is now used in more than 90 countries around the world Shahzad and his business partner Ryan Brodie were there because they had entered a global competition to win backing from prestigious Silicon Valley investment firm Y Combinator.This US company offers financial and practical support to a number of new start-ups per year.More than 13,000 applied at the same time as Muzmatch, and it was one of 800 whose founders were invited to pitch in person.As Shahzad continued his speech, the investors were soon bursting into laughter at how frank he was.Muzmatch was quickly given $1.75m (1.3m), one of 100 start-ups that got backing in 2017.Today the fast-growing company says it currently has more than one million registered users across the UK and some 90 other countries.Rewind to 2013 and it wasn't a group of investors that Shahzad had to convince, it was himself.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Users of Muzmatch can choose for a parent to be able to see their conversations via the app Back then he was working for a bank in the City of London.He enjoyed his job, but at the same time he increasingly realised that there was a gap in the market for a decent dating app aimed at Muslims who were looking for a partner from within their religious community."At the time there were either these really basic websites for Muslims, or big dating apps that didn't quite get our culture," says Shahzad, who was born and bred in Manchester."In the Muslim community a lot of us did, and still do, rely on matchmakers [to find a wife or husband].These are 'aunties' in the community who know families, and who would match up a son with another family's daughter."His idea for Muzmatch was that it would be a digital matchmaker app for Muslims who wanted to find someone to marry.In 2014, Shahzad decided that he had to make a go of the app and quit his job.Image copyright Muzmatch Image caption Business partner Ryan Brodie helped Shahzad redesign the app "I'd wake up at 6am every morning and go to bed at about one or 2am," he says. "I was working from my bedroom at home, and it was intense.I had to learn how to build an app from scratch."But I knew I had to make it work.The opportunity was big enough - there are 1.8 billion Muslims around the world, and clearly no one was serving them."Shahzad did a soft launch of the app in 2015, and his marketing methods were somewhat different to the bigger dating apps."I'd go to big mosques after Friday prayers and hand out cards for the app," he says."Then I'd go to any kind of family Muslim event that I knew was on, and I would literally stick them under windscreens."Watching a business grow on your own can be hard, and at the beginning Shahzad said he found it excruciating.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The app allows users to indicate how religious they are "I remember the first couple of months I would constantly look at Google Analytics, which would show me in real time how many people were on the app," he says.One time he says he checked, and there were just 10 people on Muzmatch.But over time user numbers grew into thousands, thanks mainly to positive word of mouth.Soon people started telling Shahzad how they had met their wives or husbands."Once I heard the first success story it made it feel real," he says."And it cemented in me that the app was going somewhere."More The Boss features: Business partner Ryan, a seasoned app builder despite still being just 25 years old, came on board in 2016.Together they completely redesigned Muzmatch, with feedback from their early customers.They added in 22 more profile questions that people were asking for, such as how religious a person is, and how often they pray - things that really mattered to their users.Muzmatch also allows users to opt out of having a profile photo, or to blur it instead.People can also tick a box whereby transcriptions of their in-app chats are sent to one of their parents, or to another chosen guardian.Shahzad says that while Ryan is not a fellow Muslim, he really "gets what the app is about".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The company now has a second office in Bangladesh, the country with the fourth largest Muslim population Eden Blackman, founder of dating website and app Would Like to Meet, says that Muzmatch has been at the forefront of more specialised dating apps."In recent years ethnic and religious dating has moved from a niche to a mainstream platform, and what Muzmatch is doing leads the pack," he says."If religion and online dating can be matched perfectly... it should be on hallowed ground.From what I have seen and heard about Muzmatch they seem to have broken the mould."Muzmatch, which also has a small team in Bangladesh, operates a "freemium" business model.It is free to use its basic service, but you can pay from 10 a month for extra features such as unlimited viewing of profiles, and having your own profile seen by more people.The company says its annual turnover is now more than 4.5m.As the app continues to grow in popularity, Shahzad says that its potential users are the estimated 400 million single Muslims around the world."We've now had thousands of marriages and babies [thanks to Muzmatch]," he says."Thinking about them every day makes me feel like all that hard work at the beginning was worth it."
Boom or bust: What culture tells us about money:::::Image copyright Getty Images Over the years, one financial crisis after another has ruined - or profited - those caught in the middle of it.The pay and benefits of UK residents is still being affected by the latest crisis of a decade ago.So when has financial advice eased, exacerbated, or even created these downturns?Researchers at the universities of Southampton, Edinburgh, Lancaster and Manchester - funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council - have explored the history of financial advice, and how it is represented in culture.The findings are part of a free, online course.Professor Nicky Marsh, principal investigator on the project, has picked out some examples from art and literature and explains what they tell us.The South Sea Bubble The failure of the South Sea Company was the crisis that shaped our understanding of the dangers of speculative bubbles.Yet many of its satirical representations focus on the deceptions of those involved and speak of a deep mistrust toward the emerging financial profession.Image copyright Lewis Walpole Library, Yale Image caption The Bubblers bubbl'd or the Devil Take the Hindmost 1721 The cartoon The Bubblers bubbl'd or the Devil Take the Hindmost, for example, depicts stockjobbers passing stock certificates that flutter down from above in a crazed dance from which they cannot free themselves, and in which the only option is to try to pass the worthless paper to the greater fool beside them.Investors in the 1720s relied on stockjobbers, rumours and friends and relatives for their financial advice.Fraud and imperial fantasies Even when the genre of financial advice had appeared, in newspaper columns and guidebooks, it was not always trustworthy.The financial boom of the 1820s provided investors with a dizzying range of new investments, especially those with an appetite for imperial adventures.The financial advice manuals that now did exist conservatively warned against these investments so new writers filled the gap.A speculative genre of financial advice emerged, one that talked up the untold wealth to be made from new discoveries, innovations, and technologies.One of the most notorious examples was Thomas Strangeways' 1822 Sketch of the Mosquito Shore.Image copyright Archive.org Image caption The Sketch of the Mosquito Shore including the Territory of Poyais by Thomas Strangeways The book was authored by the soldier and adventurer Gregor MacGregor but its glowing account of the resources and climate of the new nation of Poyais was entirely fraudulent.It was targeted chiefly at the settlers he hoped to lure to his utopia, but the book underpinned MacGregor's efforts to float a Poyais loan on the London market and he raised over 50,000 before the scam was exposed.The Brontes and railway mania Britain went mad for railway shares in the 1840s.In their Haworth parsonage, the Bronte sisters - Charlotte, Emily, and Anne - inherited shares in the York and North Midland Railway.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Charlotte Bronte wrote Jane Eyre Charlotte's letters reveal how the sisters navigated the market.Emily took charge of their investments, "carefully reading every paragraph and every advertisement in the newspapers that related to rail-roads".But the press, full of hype for the railways, did not give the best advice.Charlotte wanted to sell out before it was too late, but could not persuade "headstrong" Emily, and eventually gave way.Her concerns were vindicated when the market collapsed.Charlotte learnt from the mistake.She took the advice of her publisher in 1849 and invested the royalties from her novel Shirley in Consols (perpetual government bonds).A self-fulfilling prophecy Thomas Lawson (1857-1925) was at one point the sixth richest man in America.He made his fortune as a stock promoter, organising large corporate mergers.However, he was soon sick of what he saw as the corrupt stranglehold that a clique of big businessmen had on the American economy.Image copyright History of Financial Advice Image caption Cover of Thomas Lawson's Frenzied Finance (1906) Instead he turned to muckraking journalism, and in 1906 published Frenzied Finance.It was a searing expos of the scandal surrounding the Amalgamated Copper deal.He soon realised that journalism does not pay as well as finance, so he returned to stock promotion.This time he tried to move the market not by insider dealing or an advice manual, but by writing a sensationalist novel, Friday the Thirteenth (1907).It predicted an apocalyptic crash of the stock market.His avid readers took his warnings at face value, and ended up creating the real world the financial panic that the fiction had imagined - and Lawson pocketed the profit.The Wall Street Crash At the opening of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925), the narrator, Nick Carraway, recalls buying "a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Robert Redford in a scene from the film The Great Gatsby In the 1920s, many Americans likewise devoured guides to Wall Street speculation in the hope of following in the footsteps of the legendary financier J.P. Morgan, and came to regret it when prices on the New York Stock Exchange collapsed in the Great Crash of 1929 and they lost anything they had invested.Fitzgerald would go on to write the definitive post-crash story, Babylon Revisited, in 1931.The "luck in the market" enjoyed by the protagonist in the 1920s boom allows him to live as "a sort of royalty, almost infallible, with a sort of magic around [him]", until the market cleans him out.Fitzgerald's protagonist ultimately suffers a breakdown - a fate sadly shared by the author himself and his wife Zelda in the depression years that followed what the author called "the most expensive orgy in history".The apocalyptic 1970s As inflation steadily rose throughout the 1970s, financial advice often took a decidedly apocalyptic turn.Howard Ruff's How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years recommended buying gold, food and guns.Image copyright History of Financial Advice Image caption How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years was published in 1979 The relationship between financial advice and disaster fiction also began to blur in this moment.Paul Erdman's The Billion Dollar Sure Thing, which turned President Nixon's recent closing of the gold window into a cold war thriller, was taken up by influential economists for offering the best explanation of how money worked in the new economy emerging from the 1970s.Reading the charts The stock price chart - with its upward and downward lines forming peaks and troughs that resemble the profile of a mountain range - is one of the most familiar ways of visualising the financial markets.Many investment advice authors believe that the movements of prices reflect underlying natural laws and form recurring patterns that can be "charted" and exploited for profit.Image copyright Matthew Cornford and David Cross Image caption Black Narcissus by Matthew Cornford and David Cross In their digital work Black Narcissus (2014), the British artists Matthew Cornford and David Cross track along a computer-generated mountain skyline mapped onto the historical undulations of the stock market in the period 2003-2013.In this still from the work, the downward trend on the left, culminating in the vertiginous drop in the centre, corresponds to the global financial crisis of 2008.Here, the market quite literally falls off a cliff edge - one that very few people saw coming.
How do you know where your olive oil really comes from?:::::Image copyright oracle Image caption How do you know your extra virgin hasn't been mixed with inferior oils?When you pick up a bottle of extra virgin olive oil from the supermarket shelf, how confident are you that it's all that it seems?The olives have had a long journey: from the tree to the mill, where the oil is extracted, which then goes on to the bottling plant before distribution over land and sea to reach the store.Unfortunately, at any of these stages, it's possible for fakery to creep in."Fraud in the olive oil market has been going on a very long time," says Susan Testa, director of culinary innovation at Italian olive oil producer Bellucci."Seed oil is added maybe; or it may contain only a small percentage of Italian oil and have oil from other countries added, while it just says Italian oil on the label."In February the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) warned that poor olive harvests are likely to lead to a big increase in such adulterated oil this year.And it's far from the only product affected, with the European Union's Knowledge Centre for Food Fraud and Quality recently highlighting wine, honey, fish, dairy products, meat and poultry as being frequently faked.Moreover, 40% of food companies believe traditional methods of countering food fraud aren't working any more, according to research from PwC.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption From tree to supermarket shelf, the olive goes through many stages and many countries Food suppliers, like Bellucci are making efforts to guarantee the provenance of their food themselves, using new tools such as blockchain technology.Best-known for its role in crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, blockchain is a way of keeping records in which each block of data is time-stamped and linked irreversibly to the last, in a way that can't be subsequently altered.That makes it possible to keep a secure record of the product's journey to the supermarket shelf.Since the company was founded in 2013, Bellucci has aimed to build a reputation around the traceability of its oil.Customers can enter the lot number of a particular bottle into an app to see its precise provenance, right back to the groves where the olives were harvested.Image copyright Oracle Image caption Andrea Biagianti from Bellucci says blockchain paves the way for more information to be shared And over the last year, Bellucci has introduced a blockchain-based system, created by Oracle, to underpin this traceability which it says will make the process more efficient."We expect an improvement in the exchange of information throughout the supply chain," says Andrea Biagianti, chief information officer for Certified Origins, Bellucci's parent company."We would also like the ability [to have] more transparency in the supply chain and the genuine trust of consumers."IBM's Food Trust network, formally launched late last year, uses similar techniques."In the registration phase, you define the product and its properties - for example, the optical spectrum you see when you look at a bottle of whisky," explains Andreas Kind, head of blockchain at IBM Research.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Blockchain tech aims to make it much more difficult to interfere with bottles' contents The appearance of the whisky is precisely recorded within the blockchain, meaning that the description can't later be altered.Then transport companies, border control, storage providers or retailers, can see if the look of the liquid no longer matches the description or "optical signature".Meanwhile, labels holding tamper-proof "cryptoanchors" are fixed to the bottles.These contain tiny computers holding the product data - encrypted, or encoded, so it can't be tampered with.The labels break when the bottle is opened.Linking the packaging and the product in this way offers a kind of proof says Mr Kind, "a bit like when you buy a diamond and get a certificate."IBM is also working with US supermarket chain Walmart, which is rolling out a blockchain-based system that will require all its leafy greens suppliers, along with packing companies and transport operators, to take part.Image copyright Alibaba Image caption Alibaba's online retail site, Tmall Global, uses blockchain tech to help consumers check product authenticity Meanwhile, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba uses blockchain to track food products shipped from Australia and New Zealand; suppliers like New Zealand's largest dairy firm, Fonterra, have adopted the technology.But they go one step further."In addition to blockchain technology, the framework will also tag products using QR codes to authenticate, verify, record and provide ongoing reporting throughout the product's lifecycle," says Fonterra president for greater China, Christina Zhu.One product Fonterra provides detailed information for is its Anmum infant nutrition range, including the results of factory inspections and product quality sampling tests.But it's not only in the area of tracking supply chains that technology is providing new avenues to approach food fraud.In recent years, there has been progress in identifying food fraud through closer examination of the product itself using DNA analysis.But this approach has one big limitation: to detect an unauthorised ingredient, you have to know what you're looking for.So it's possible to test whether, say, a beef lasagne contains horsemeat, but not to scan a product for unauthorised ingredients without any idea in advance of what it might contain.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Back in 2013 traces of horsemeat were found in ready meals labelled as beef Now, though, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has developed a new scanning tool that can identify all the ingredients in a product, along with their biological sources.It uses Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) - a large-scale testing method that allows whole genomes to be sequenced rapidly.The FSAI has tested the scanner on 45 random samples and found that four contained plant species that weren't listed on the label.More Technology of Business One of them was mustard - a known allergen that should always be declared."We don't have to wait for tip-offs any more," says Dr Patrick O'Mahoney, chief specialist, food science and technology at the FSIA.Nevertheless he cautions against interpreting the results too literally."As regulators, we have to be pragmatic about what could be a labelling error rather than food fraud," he says."We go for the ones where there's an obvious financial benefit for somebody."Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
How a bookshop wolf handles awkward customers:::::Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne Barnetson uses humour to show how to defuse situations that can make people feel bad We've all heard of the saying "the customer is always right" but when you work in service industries, what can you do to vent your frustration when the customer is rather annoying?Whether it's children running riot, requests for the most obscure information, or just plain rude customers, Australian bookshop worker Anne Barnetson has faced it all.But she's come up with a rather novel way of dealing with such awkward situations.Anne is the creator of Customer Service Wolf, a comic found on Instagram and Tumblr.It gives a humorous anthropomorphic take on life dealing with strangers turning up in bookshops with strange requests.Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption The wolf is supposed to represent the "everyman" and show a whole range of experiences felt by those in customer service The images can have a bite to them.Some show the wolf getting so frustrated with unfair demands and indecision that it ends up bounding over the counter and eating the customers, who tend to be rabbits, birds and other prey."It's unenacted fantasies that I think people have after a very long day when they think: 'It would just be great to stop all this right now,'" laughs Anne, who lives and works in Perth, Western Australia.She is, however, keen to stress that she's a lot more polite in real life and the interactions shown are very much exaggerated.This is a bit of a relief as one of the more icky comics shows a creature seeking a (made up as far as we can tell) book called Chicken Soup for the Soul: Urine Therapy for Tweens, second edition.The wolf worker's reaction is one of sheer unadulterated horror.Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne says she would probably recommend barbecue recipe books to any wolves that turned up in the bookshops she works in Anne says: "The idea came about when I was working at a bookstore with a good friend and we had nicknames for each other.I was 'Flying Wolf' and she was 'Black Wolf'.She said: 'Wouldn't it be funny if savage predators worked in retail and they could just eat the customers that really irritated them?'"Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption The first comic was created for Anne's friend as a gift She drew the first strip for her friend in 2012 - an interaction between a wolf worker and an indecisive rabbit - but soon realised that she had a whole hoard of experiences to unleash upon the world.Anne says it's far safer to draw the characters as animals."It gave me free rein to be as humorous and rude as I liked about the interactions I've had with my customers.I'd hate to actually upset anyone."Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption The comments on the comic strip tend to reflect similar experiences other workers have had However, she does have friends and colleagues who turn up in the comics."Dr Fox is always happy when he sees himself.Manager Wolf is another repeat character.You can pick him out because he wears a tie, which my boss used to find hilarious.He didn't wear a tie, but still it's about representing middle management."Anne hasn't revealed which bookshops she works in, although she is now starting to get recognition because of the comic strip."Thank goodness no-one has pointed out themselves and said: 'Oh, I'm going to sue for defamation or anything,'" she says.People who comment on her strips often share their own experiences."On my first shift in a bookstore, a lady asked for an orange book but she couldn't remember the title.Or summary.Just 'big orange book'," says one fellow bookshop worker."My favourite record store repeat request.'You know that love song they're always playing on the radio.You must know it.They play it all the time,'" another reader comments.Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne, a professional illustrator, hopes the comic strip will eventually lead to a book deal But what does Anne personally do when dealing with difficult customers, apart from store up the experiences to use as inspiration for the comics?"I've found that if you're in customer service, people can be a little condescending or just assume you don't have feelings or will be very impatient.The ones that still make me feel horrible when I think about them are those where I've been properly yelled at, usually by a man."I am definitely not as quick as the wolf.I stumble, get quite awkward, and then fume about it for hours, days and weeks afterwards."That's what's so nice about living out the fantasy in the wolf comics - they are completely instinctual, specialised animals that are quick to act and they don't think about it."But of course, being human is much more awkward, complicated and difficult."All images courtesy of Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com
Chinese imports 'driving fishermen to despair':::::Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Kenya's fishermen are increasingly struggling to make a living As the frozen fish defrosts under the hot Kenyan sun, fishmonger Mechak Juma prefers not to tell his customers that it has come all the way from China.We are at the largest fish market in the city of Kisumu, on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake.A scene of hustle and bustle, business is booming for the traders, but very little of that money now goes to the local fishermen.As fish stocks in Lake Victoria have plunged over the past two decades, and prices have risen sharply as a result, cheap farmed Chinese imports are increasingly filling the gap."People don't want to buy Chinese fish because they don't trust the [farmed] production process, but we don't have much of a choice," says Mechak, standing next to a big wicker basket of whole Chinese tilapia fish.The trampled cardboard boxes used to ship the frozen fish 8,000 km (5,000 miles) are stashed away in a corner, and the fish itself is more than two years old.It will expire in less than a month, according to the dates on the boxes.Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Chinese fish farms are able to operate very cheaply by using rice industry waste as food "People prefer to buy local fish, but we earn nothing on local fish now," says the 29-year-old."Only by selling Chinese fish am I able to earn enough money to feed my family."Fish catches from Lake Victoria have plummeted by more than half over the past two decades, due to overfishing and pollution.Over the same period Kenya's population has doubled.Vast stretches of water hyacinths, an invasive weed, along the shorelines, have also caused severe problems for the country's fishermen.The thick, interwoven carpet of the plants means that smaller boats can struggle to get out to clear water.Kenya's Lake Victoria fishermen now bring in an estimated 140,000 tonnes of fish per year, little more than a quarter of the 500,000 required.Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Kenya's fisherman sometimes cannot sell all their catch Chinese companies and their Kenyan partners seized the opportunity, and are now said to be exporting more than $17m (13m) of fish to Kenya annually, more than double the amount three years ago.It was an easy gap for the Chinese to fill, because the freshwater fish that they farm on a vast scale - tilapia - is from the same broad species that Kenyans mostly catch in Lake Victoria.So for Kenyan consumers the fish look and taste very similar.The Chinese fish is just considerably cheaper, selling for as little as $1.70 per kg, compared with about $5 per kg for the local catch.For Kenyan fisherman Frederike Otieno, it is a hopeless situation."While we spend many nights on the lake and lose a lot of money on fuel, we have to compete with this cheap Chinese farmed fish that floods the market," says the 36-year-old.Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Kenya's fishmongers are often reluctant to admit that their fish is Chinese The father of three says that sometimes he cannot sell all his catch.A fisherman for 10 years, he says he used to earn about 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($30; 23) per day, but that has now fallen to little more than 400 shillings.In November last year, the Kenyan government moved to try to protect the Lake Victoria fishing industry by imposing an import ban on foreign tilapia.But the restrictions were lifted in January after China's ambassador to Kenya, Li Xuhang, referred to the ban as a "trade war".It was also reported that China had threatened to freeze funding for a new railway line connecting Kenya with Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.However, the official explanation from Kenya's Department for Fisheries for the U-turn was that "a huge shipment of [Chinese] fish was held up at the port of Mombasa, negatively impacting local supplies".Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Not all the frozen Chinese fish on sale in Kenya is within its best before date What Kenyan authorities are continuing with is efforts to improve fish stocks in the lake, for example, by arresting fishermen who fish too close to the breeding areas near the shores to save on time and fuel.But this deterrent continues to increase prices in the short term, as fisherman have to travel further out into the lake.The biggest importer of Chinese fish in Kenya is a company called East African Sea Food.Its director, John Musafari, says that while the farmed Chinese tilapia is high quality, the low prices are possible because the fish is fed on rice bran, which is cheap and plentiful.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: This bran is the hard outer layer of each rice grain, which is removed in China before the rice is sold to consumers.Mr Musafari adds that fish farming has not taken off in Kenya because fish feed "is extremely expensive" in the country, due to it currently being made from maize, which is also the country's staple food.He wants to see more investment in the development of cheaper fish feed in Kenya."That could really boost the country's aquaculture," he says.Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Some say that the long-term future of fishing on Lake Victoria is in doubt Others in Kenya are very happy with the growing reliance on Chinese fish imports, such as Simon who helps to transport the boxes across the country."Thanks to this Chinese tilapia, poor people can now eat nutritious protein-rich fish as well," says Simon, who declined to give his full name.He now makes $300 a day, which for many Kenyans is more than their monthly salary.Yet for Edward Oremo, a Kenyan fisheries official, it will ultimately mean the end of commercial fishing on Lake Victoria."As long as Chinese imports continue... fishermen will be driven to despair, and Lake Victoria will be empty [of fishing boats] in less than 50 years."All pictures copyright Jeroen van Loon.
'Corruption in Ukraine has to be stopped':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cranes stand idle at Mariupol on the Azov Sea The port of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine has become a symbol in recent months of the country's economic struggles.A recent partial blockade by Russian naval vessels of the nearby Kerch Strait means that fewer ships are now docking at the harbour.The port has lost 33% of its fleet and up to 140,000 tonnes of exported metal products a month since Russia's construction of a bridge across the Kerch Strait in May 2018, and restrictions on the size of ships that can pass underneath.Cargo vessels are being delayed by up to a week, and the cranes on the dock stand idle.Larger international shipping firms have simply stopped coming.Hundreds of jobs depend on the work here - Mariupol is Ukraine's second port - and many tens of thousands more depend on the export of goods it allows.Image caption Mariupol needs the blockade to be lifted, says Galina Balobanova "Big business feels it and we all feel it too because prices are rising," says Galina Balobanova, a local businesswoman."A lot of people work in the port and they're not being laid off, but for them it's an unexpected vacation.We need this trade and for the blockade to be lifted."Yet it's not just the relationship with Russia that is the problem for firms in Mariupol.Another businessman, who doesn't want to be named, meets me in a local bar and puts it bluntly: "The Russians are a big problem - but the corruption here is the single biggest thing strangling our trade."Money for much-needed dredging of the harbour has simply gone missing, he tells me, presumed stolen by officials, and this has placed big limits on the types of ships reaching the dock.Image caption The recent defence procurement scandal in Ukraine has angered many in the country The way that corruption impedes business in Ukraine is varied and has been widely studied.In the past ordinary citizens would often have to pay a bribe just for simple procedures such as a visit to a doctor, obtaining a passport or driving licence.Much of this has now improved, though, thanks to a system called PreZorro that bypasses human officials and allows digital processing of applications and tenders."The last five years the pace of reforms is amazing," says Olesia Verchenko, academic director at the Kyiv School of Economics."If you look at the price of drugs, for example, in hospitals you sometimes have a tenfold decrease in the health ministry's costs [as a result of the reforms]."These changes mean that regular small and medium-sized businesses in Ukraine may not see corruption firsthand.But experts say it is still a problem at the highest level, in the courts and among the political class.Image caption An anti-corruption slogan: Transparency International's 2018 corruption perception index ranks Ukraine as 120th out of 180 countries "They stole money from our army, they stole the lives of our soldiers," says Vyacheslav, a protester I meet at a noisy demonstration in Independence Square in Kiev.The charges he refers to are recently revealed documents implicating senior members of Petro Poroshenko's government in a defence procurement scam worth some $10m (8m).Smuggled Russian munitions and other weaponry were allegedly sold to the Ukrainian military at wildly inflated prices.The two senior officials have been suspended by the president pending an investigation."They were so confident they wouldn't get caught, they filtered the money through their own companies," says Sergey Leshchenko, an MP and former investigative journalist.President Poroshenko has not been directly accused of any wrongdoing himself.But one of those firms was one formally owned by the president."It's impossible he couldn't have known," Mr Leshchenko adds.Image caption "Fixing corruption in this country is Ukraine's number one problem, it has to be stopped," says MP Sergey Leshchenko The IMF has made accountability and transparency a condition of recent bailouts in Ukraine, but even it admits that those accused of corrupt practices are rarely seriously punished.In what's been seen as a backwards step, just two days after the defence scandal broke, the constitutional court ruled that those accused of corruption no longer have to provide evidence in court on how they came by their wealth.For Mr Leshchenko this scandal has been the last straw.He has withdrawn his support for President Poroshenko and is not backing any of the other established parliamentary candidates in this month's presidential election either, saying the entire political elite is compromised."Fixing corruption in this country is Ukraine's number one problem, it has to be stopped," he says."It's in the interests of Europe and the whole world and that's why I urge friends abroad not to back Ukraine's corrupt leadership but to protect anti-corruption institutions - and free and fair elections."
Jim Ratcliffe: Turning cast-offs into gold:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK's richest man Jim Ratcliffe is the proud new owner of a high-profile professional cycling team, after his firm Ineos took over the former Team Sky.The team will change its name to become known as Team Ineos mid-season, racing under its new name for the first time at the Tour de Yorkshire at the beginning of May.The British-registered outfit had been seeking new funding after Sky said in December that it would end its ownership and sponsorship at the end of this year.In many ways it is a familiar modus operandi for the man once called Dr No by trade unions for his tough negotiating stance.Through buying up and turning around cast-off parts of other businesses, the Mancunian has made a 21bn fortune.Private equity From operations once owned by the likes of oil giant BP, Mr Ratcliffe has created a company whose chemicals and raw materials go into nearly everything we touch every day.And it only took him 20 years to do it.Mr Ratcliffe, 66, has always been involved in chemicals and industry.After graduating with a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Birmingham in 1974, he spent a very brief spell at BP before jumping to rival oil business Esso as a trainee accountant.Armed with an MBA from the London Business School, Mr Ratcliffe moved to fabric and chemicals producer Courtaulds before a career-changing step into the world of private equity when he joined Advent International in 1989.Art of the deal Advent served as a platform for Mr Ratcliffe to learn the cut and thrust of doing deals.But after just three years, he was already making a leap into co-owning a business based on what would become a well-worn strategy.He and fellow businessman John Hollowood decided to buy BP's chemicals division in Hythe, Kent for 40m in 1992.By 1994, it was valued at 100m when it floated on the London Stock Exchange.It was a high-risk move, Mr Ratcliffe admitted."I started the business in the days when you had to put all your worldly goods on the table," he told the London Business School in an interview."I had to put 100% of the equity that I owned at that stage on the line, so that was the house, savings and even the wife and children, which makes you very focused."The business, Inspec, went on to acquire BP's speciality chemicals business in Antwerp, Belgium.Mr Ratcliffe left Inspec to form his own firm, Ineos, in 1998 which bought the Belgian business for 89m.Ineos is now worth 35bn, according to The Sunday Times Rich List - based on Mr Ratcliffe's strategy of buying "unfashionable or unsexy facilities owned by large corporations where you'd know they would be sloppy with the fixed costs".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ineos reversed a plan to close its Grangemouth plant in 2013 From 181 sites across 22 countries, Ineos generates sales of around 45bn and employs 18,500 people.Its raw materials are used in everything from packaging for toiletries, medicines and food, to mobile phones and furniture.Because of his decision never to float the company and thus have no City shareholders to consult, Mr Ratcliffe, who owns 60% of Ineos, has been able to move quickly on deals.In its first 10 years, Ineos bought more than 20 operations from huge companies such as German chemicals maker BASF, Dow Chemical of the US and ICI, once the biggest manufacturer in the UK.Quadrupled sales Arguably, the most important of these deals was Ineos's 5bn takeover of Innovene, BP's petrochemical business, in 2005.Overnight, it quadrupled Ineos's sales to more than 18bn and doubled its staff numbers to 15,000.Innovene also included the Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery in Scotland which, in 2013, became the scene of a tense stand-off with trade unions threatening strike action over pay and pensions.The dispute - which earned Mr Ratcliffe the Bond villain moniker of Dr No - led to Ineos announcing that it would close the petrochemical plant and cut 800 jobs.Shortly afterwards, Ineos reversed its decision when the Unite union agreed to a survival plan to invest 300m in the plant to keep it open.Ineos continues to expand either through acquisitions such as buying the Forties Pipeline System from BP, which delivers 40% of the UK's North Sea oil and gas or through investment into controversial areas such as fracking.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ineos bought the motorcycle wear maker Belstaff Ineos has pledged to invest 650m in fracking and in 2016 created much fanfare around the arrival of the first shipment of shale gas from the US to arrive in the UK.The company is locked in a legal battle with the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking.Meanwhile, Mr Ratcliffe took a surprising step away from chemicals when he announced plans to invest 600m to build a new vehicle based on the Land Rover Defender, which was discontinued in 2016.Ineos then bought Belstaff, the luxury motorcycle wear maker whose jackets were once worn by actor Steve McQueen and modelled by the likes of David Beckham.The company then acquired the Swiss football team FC Lausanne-Sport.Whether or not these businesses could be classed as unloved is not certain, but Mr Ratcliffe clearly sees plenty of potential in them.
Why are Venezuelans seeking refuge in crypto-currencies?:::::Image copyright Megan Janetsky Image caption Eli Meregote uses crypto-currencies to send money home to Venezuela Crypto-currencies have faced a lot of criticism since Bitcoin first came on the scene 10 years ago.But for one group of people, they're proving very useful.Venezuela has seen its currency rendered practically valueless after suffering one of the worst periods of hyperinflation since World War Two.A cup of coffee now costs 2,800 bolivars (21p; 28 cents), up from 0.75 bolivars 12 months ago - an increase of 373,233%, according to Bloomberg data.And that's after a 2018 devaluation that knocked five zeros off the currency.More than three million Venezuelans have left the country, as essential goods such as toilet paper and medicine have become unaffordable and crime has soared.As a result, many are turning to digital assets such as Bitcoin as an alternative to the Venezuelan bolivar.And given how volatile Bitcoin is - its value has plunged from nearly 15,000 in 2017 to less than 3,000 now - it's an indication of just how desperate people have become.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bitcoin may be volatile but the Venezuelan bolivar has been losing value much faster Even the government has launched its own crypto-currency, the Petro, supposedly backed by oil, to provide a solution to the economic crisis.But critics say it is a sham and there is no evidence of anyone using it.Eli Meregote, 28, has been using Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies as a way of sending money home from Colombia where he now lives and works, avoiding the fees usually associated with money transfer services such as Western Union."I first discovered crypto in 2017 when I lost my job in Venezuela," the CCTV technician says."Even if I had my job, it would've been useless anyway, because the minimum wage was $4 a month."Cryptos offered him "total control" of his money "without banks or third parties", he says."With Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, I can send money home faster and without obstacles."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Venezuela blackout crisis: "It's like living in the apocalypse" Bitcoin was designed to be a global, digital currency that governments and banks couldn't interfere with.Like many other crypto-currencies it works by recording all transactions permanently on a distributed ledger called the blockchain.Critics say Bitcoin and other cryptos - there are more than 1,600 globally - are unstable, use too much energy, and are used by money launderers or those wanting to buy illicit goods on the web.But for Venezuelans, storing their money in a digital wallet in the form of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash or any of the others, is still a better option than holding on to the national currency.Adoption has rocketed, with trading volumes on Localbitcoins.com - a person-to-person Bitcoin trading platform - rivalling those of the US.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness Although trading volumes dipped in March due to a power cut that plunged the country into darkness for days, February saw trading levels reach 6.84m ($8.76m) per week and nearly 1m per day, according to crypto-currency data tracker Coin Dance."Many Venezuelans are using Bitcoin to convert their bolivars, which are being permanently devalued by hyperinflation, to keep something of value," says economist Asdrubal Oliveros of Caracas-based consultancy Econanalitica."It is practically a vehicle for buying foreign currency and to conserve value, as it is relatively easy and you can keep small amounts which do not involve large investments."Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Venezuelan bolivar notes are now useful only for making handicraft gifts Mr Oliveros points out that in Venezuela many people work as freelancers, receiving their pay in bitcoin since in most cases they do not have accounts abroad that allow them to make transfers in dollars."Receiving payments in bolivars does not make much sense," he says.Matt Aaron, who manages the Venezuela arm of Bitcoin.com, the crypto-currency news and trading platform, says: "We pay our team members in Caracas in Bitcoin Cash.Transactions are instant and cost less than a cent to make."Ricardo Carrasco, 29, an IT engineer who is paid in bitcoin, is a fan of the crypto-currency."It has given me access to the financial world outside Venezuela," he says."We are not free to exchange our currency for US dollars or any other currency.We don't have access to the banking services of the world, so crypto allows you to bypass those barriers."Image copyright Ricardo Carrasco Image caption Ricardo Carrasco likes Bitcoin's borderless nature Mr Carrasco sells small amounts of Bitcoin on Localbitcoins.com and other exchanges, and receives money in bolivars to his Venezuelan account.He is then able to buy goods with his card as and when he needs to."It is a pretty simple, straightforward process," he says.But Venezuela's government is intervening, recently launching a remittance service that caps the amount of crypto-currency someone inside the country can receive.It has started earning commissions from the transactions.More Technology of Business One thing is certain: despite the Bitcoin crash and loss in value of other crypto-currencies, Venezuelans have more interest in digital assets than ever before.In the Colombian border town of Cucuta, which sees tens of thousands of fleeing Venezuelans arrive every day, a new crypto-currency cash machine (ATM) was opened in March.It is designed to make carrying funds safer and more convenient.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Security services have clashed with looters panicking about short supplies of goods "With the ATM, Venezuelans can receive bitcoin from anywhere in the world and cash out in Colombian pesos right away," says Matias Goldenhrn from Athena, the company that installed the machine."A Venezuelan family of four, getting on a bus in Cucuta to emigrate to Argentina, was carrying all their life savings in cash on their 14-day bus journey," he recalls."They just exchanged all the money into bitcoin and, once they arrived at their final destination, sold the crypto for the local currency, hence not risking travelling with the money on them."It made life a lot easier for them."At least there is one country in the world where Bitcoin is serving a practical value for ordinary citizens rather than speculators.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Exam failure who became a multi-millionaire hotelier:::::Image copyright Robin Hutson Image caption Robin Hutson has had an illustrious career in the hotel industry The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to Robin Hutson, founder and chief executive of UK hotel business Home Grown Hotels.Robin Hutson's life would probably have been far less successful if he hadn't failed his school exams."I managed to screw up all my O-levels, and wasn't invited to sixth-form college," recalls the 62-year-old."So I had to find something else to do."At the age of 16 I wasn't interested in doing much apart from chasing girls, and my mother said 'well, you always liked messing around in the kitchen'."Image copyright Robin Hutson Image caption To launch the first Hotel du Vin, Robin and his wife Judy put their home up as guarantee She advised her son to enrol on a course in hotel and catering operations, which whetted his appetite for a career in the hospitality industry.He went on to establish the popular Hotel du Vin chain in 1994, which made him a multi-millionaire 10 years later when he and his business partner sold the company for 66m.Since 2011 Robin has build up another collection of hotels, called The Pig.Currently with six locations across the south of England, the company behind the brand - Home Grown Hotels - has annual revenues of more than 20m.While Robin's successful career has seen him dubbed "Britain's most influential hotelier", you cannot accuse him of not serving a decent apprenticeship.After graduating from catering college in Surrey, south of London, in the mid 1970s, he joined the management training programme of the then Savoy Group of hotels.Image copyright Home Grown Hotels Image caption Robin's hotels always put a big emphasis on the food they offer This saw him start as a junior waiter at the five-star London hotel Claridge's, before moving across to the equally prestigious Hotel de Crillon in Paris.He then returned to London where, at the age of 23, he became the youngest ever reception manager at The Berkeley.This was followed by two years at a hotel in Bermuda.He was lured back to the UK when he was offered the position of general manager at a hotel in Hampshire when he was just 28.Robin clocked up eight years in that job.but then decided it was time to strike out on his own."I was 36, I'd done a fair amount of working for others, and I thought 'is that what I want to do for the rest of my life, or will I try and do something else?'."Image copyright Home Grown Hotels Image caption The Pig hotels are mostly country retreats The something else was a boutique city centre hotel, with a particular focus on the food and wine.So in 1994 he teamed up with his friend, Gerard Basset, a former sommelier, to launch Hotel du Vin in Winchester, Hampshire.To raise the money he needed, Robin says he managed to persuade his wife Judy to agree that they would put their house up as a guarantee."It's probably the bravest thing Judy has ever done, and thank God she did," he says.Robin and Gerard also raised 500,000 from friends and family, and borrowed 750,000 from the bank."I sort of passed the hat around anyone we knew had a spare bob," says Robin.Image copyright Robin Hutson Image caption Robin Hutson, left, is an enthusiastic long distance cyclist in his spare time Due to a lack of resources, the two founders were forced to roll up their sleeves."Gerard and I used to take time sleeping on the sofa to provide night cover," he says."It was exhausting, we were doing everything from making breakfast to serving in the restaurant.But we were profitable in the first year."Striving to offer guests something new, Hotel du Vin provided fresh milk in the mini bars, and served decent ground coffee.While those two things don't seem imaginative now, Robin says that at the time they were "seen as revolutionary" in the hotel industry.More The Boss features: Hotel du Vin grew into a chain of six hotels, but on its 10th anniversary Robin and Gerard sold up to an investment group, after they said they were given an offer they couldn't refuse.Robin went on to become chairman of the Soho House private club chain for four years.Then in 2008 he set up a new five star hotel in Hampshire, called Lime Wood.The first The Pig hotel opened nearby in 2011.As was the case at Hotel du Vin, Judy leads the design of the interiors of each The Pig location.Robin chose the name because he likes a well-known New York restaurant called The Spotted Pig.Zoe Monk, editor of Boutique Hotelier magazine, says that the secret of Robin's success is his "ability to spot where the market is heading and identify gaps in the hospitality sector".Image copyright Robin Hutson Image caption Robin called his latest hotel chain The Pig after being inspired by the Spotted Pig restaurant in New York She adds: "He creates trends and experiences that tap into a new mindset... after noticing what was missing from the mainstream market."Last year, trade magazine The Caterer ranked Robin as the UK's second most powerful hotelier.Looking forward, the publication's editor Chris Gamm says that Robin and other hotel owners may face recruitment difficulties due to Brexit."A major challenge the industry is currently facing is recruiting and retaining enough staff, which will be especially hard for Robin as he's in the process of opening new hotels," says Mr Gamm.Robin agrees that Brexit is a worry."Everyone in the hospitality industry is concerned how staffing will tighten up," he says."In the industry we generally rely on a lot of labour from outside the UK.About 25% of our 700 staff are non-Brits."As to his plans for the future of The Pig chain, and his other hotel business - Lime Wood Group - he is keeping his aspirations in check."I have no ambition to grow a 50-strong hotel chain," he says."It's not my thing," says Robin, who in December rode a motorcycle 7,000 km (4,350 miles) across Chile and Argentina."I don't know how many more I'll open.It's got to be the right property and right location."
Mopping up Dieselgate: The boss transforming Volkswagen:::::Image copyright Volkswagen Image caption Hiltrud Werner grew up in East Germany, where "more than 90% of the women worked" Hiltrud Werner knows how to handle rooms full of men.As the lone woman on Volkswagen's management board, she is a rarity in the upper echelons of German industry.Yet her ascent was not the result of an effort to blend in.Ms Werner's first appearance in front of an all-male board was less than a decade ago - at a firm she declines to name - and it was a memorable one."I got a very nice email that said: 'Please Hiltrud, wear trousers, they are not used to skirts in the boardroom,'" she recalls with a playful grin."Of course, I came in a pink dress."The 52-year-old joined Volkswagen's board in February 2017, at one of the most turbulent moments in the carmaker's history.As head of integrity, she was charged with putting VW's house in order, and reforming a corporate culture which turned a blind eye to the widespread cheating of diesel-emissions tests.In the German press, she is often portrayed as a matron-like figure, hired to clean up a mess made by men who should have known better.It is a characterisation she dislikes - noting that women are among those charged in the various "Dieselgate" investigations.However, it is hard to overlook the irony of the appointment: when a woman finally got to the top of VW, she was handed a poisoned chalice.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Volkswagen is in the process of repairing the damage to its brand Ms Werner says she considered it an "honour" to be asked to oversee VW's turnaround, but she is under no illusions about the scale of the task.To date, the diesel emissions scandal has cost Volkswagen roughly 28bn, ($31bn; 24bn) and her prediction is that 2019 will be the firm's "most difficult year" ever.The pressure on her is not just internal.Her efforts are being closely scrutinised by the court-appointed monitor Larry Thompson, a former US Attorney General who worked on the prosecutions of Enron executives, and whose task it is to evaluate whether the group's ethics programmes are robust enough to prevent further criminal activity.Since Ms Werner's interview for this piece, the company has faced further negative headlines.Its chief executive, Herbert Diess, apologised for evoking a Nazi slogan, while American regulators filed suit against VW, claiming it misled investors in the run-up to Dieselgate."We are still busy with the root cause analysis," Ms Werner explains.The origins of the Dieselgate scandal, she maintains, are "complex" but that VW felt it was "too big to fail" and there was not enough self reflection, employees thought what they did "in the context of the company, was good".To try to remedy that, Ms Werner and her team have rewritten the job specifications for more than 2,000 people, "to make sure that roles and responsibilities are clear and that everyone understands what their obligations are".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Germany needs to reflect on how it views women in business, says Ms Werner But she is not content with challenging the culture of one of Germany's largest companies, and has her sights set on transforming her compatriots' attitudes to women in power.That task may prove to be even more daunting: Germany, as she points out, was one of last developed economies to get an anti-discrimination law, in 2006.At the time of writing, not a single one of German's top 30 firms has a female chief executive.The Reykjavik Index - a survey of 10,000 people across the G7 group of nations conducted by Kantar and Women's Political Leaders - found that only 29% of Germans would feel very comfortable having a woman at the helm of a major company.(For comparison, almost 60% of British respondents were very comfortable with the concept.One theory is that austerity has forced more women into work in the UK, which in turn led to greater cultural acceptance.)Many of Ms Werner's fellow corporate leaders do not grasp the scale of Germany's problem.When touring other companies' offices, she says, executives sometime say: "Oh you know what, we did really well, we've got a woman on the board."Image copyright VW Image caption Germany's car industry is still male-dominated When she appears in public in Germany calling for equal pay and equal opportunities, "people think I'm the chief human resources officer", she says.In other words, they don't see her cause as being central to a company's overall governance.The lack of progress within German business is in stark contrast to the country's political arena.Angela Merkel is in her 14th year as chancellor.Her most likely successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is a woman, as is Andrea Nahles, who leads their coalition partners, the SPD.Hiltrud Werner and Angela Merkel have something in common - both were brought up in East Germany, a country, Ms Werner points out, in which "more than 90% of the women worked".With some sympathy, she recalls how Mrs Merkel was publicly dismissed by her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, in the immediate aftermath of her first win in 2005.But she is critical of the way in which the chancellor went about winning over her critics.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption VW's headquarters are being closely scrutinised by a US monitor "She has been seen as very gender neutral," says Ms Werner, adding that Mrs Merkel is "always wearing trousers - boring outfits, you could say".Ms Werner makes an effort to do the opposite: "I don't want to be a woman dressed like a man, I often intentionally come in colourful dresses."Not having children has also helped Mrs Merkel overcome German prejudices."She has never been seen as a working mother that left her kids at home," says Ms Werner."She did not experience all the struggles that other women in leading positions feel."That's why we have such a long way still to go in Germany, because the role model is just half a role model."Not that Ms Werner is immune to the pressure felt by women in the workplace to please their male peers.At the start of her 28-year career in the car industry, she confesses, she was just "looking for a survival strategy" and taught herself to speak "the language of men" in an attempt to blend in.Image copyright AFP Image caption Angela Merkel is "just half a role model", says Hiltrud Werner She learned that "if you are asked what car you are driving, and you answer 'a red one' then that is wrong".Instead she would show colleagues pictures of her particular model - highlighting its engine power and how exhilarating she found it to drive on alpine roads.This adjustment was a part of "making sure everyone understands that you love the product," she says.As VW goes about repairing its reputation, Ms Werner wants the firm's hundreds of thousands of employees to hear the same message: that she has the car industry's best interests at heart."I have a lot of fuel in my blood," she says, pausing to acknowledge Volkswagen's next big bet."Maybe in future I will have to say I have some electricity in my blood."
AI and spices: Would you put cumin on a pizza?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What role can technology play in the ancient art of spice mixing?What do Tuscan Chicken, Bourbon Pork Tenderloin and New Orleans Sausage all have in common?They're all new spice mix flavours that have been developed by the world's biggest spice firm using artificial intelligence (AI).But with taste such a subjective experience, can machines really do the job better than humans?And what does this mean for cultures that see spice as a clear token of identity?Spice giant McCormick, which sells spices to consumers but also develops flavours for the food industry, says it spent four years crunching through more than 40 years of flavour-related data, using machine learning to come up with new flavour combinations that human scientists might not have considered.After all, would you have thought of trying cumin on pizza?But some traditional spice producers are unimpressed.Neelam Verhomal runs Mohanlal Verhomal (MV) Spices in Jodhpur, northern India, along with her mother and six sisters.She laughs when she hears about the AI developments.Image copyright MV Spices Image caption Neelam Verhomal uses traditional methods to blend spices in her spice store in India For her, there is a real human art to creating the perfect spice blends."My late father Mohanlal was a scientist and inventor and he actually tested each spice and its chemical composition to prepare the masala blends," she says."My mother would then do the taste test at home - and that made a big difference."Her family's mixes don't contain preservatives or flavour enhancers and are made using traditional grinding methods, with matriarch Bhagvanti overseeing the process and giving the final sign-off.So McCormick and its tech partner IBM Research are straying into controversial territory.As someone of Kenyan-Indian heritage, I can testify that it's rare for a South Asian family not to possess a masala dabba - a storage box used to create spice blends at home filled with staples such as turmeric, cumin, paprika and asafoetida (hing).Our own one is more than 60 years old and has travelled through several continents and generations.Image copyright Dhruti Shah Image caption Many South Asian homes have a masala dabba spice box as a fixture in the kitchen Spices aren't just a flavour, they're key to culture, heritage and history.So does AI really have a role to play here?Dr Hamed Faridi, McCormick's chief science officer, says that deep analysis of tens of thousands of previously successful spice mixes is helping the company come up with new flavours more quickly."A product, from the beginning to the end, can take somewhere between 50 to 150 iterations before it is ready for commercialisation," Dr Faridi says.If all that data is shared and analysed, the company says it could cut the time it takes to come up with new flavours by 70% and reduce training time for new product developers."It takes an experienced product developer about 10 to 15 years to become highly trained in what they do, so it makes business sense to develop a system that means every person is as good as the best person we have," says Dr Faridi.Combining flavours is a complex business it seems."In a kitchen [at home] you might have maybe one or two types of fresh garlic and possibly a garlic powder," explains IBM research scientist Dr Robin Lougee."But a product developer at McCormick will have potentially 50 different types of garlic, all of which are different sizes, different granule sizes, have different flavour profiles.On top of that they have to consider all of the other constraints."These constraints - usually client requirements - can include the need for recipes to be kosher or halal, free from genetically modified organisms, or low in salt, for example, as well as needing regulatory approval.More Technology of Business The AI is also useful for suggesting similar flavours that might act as a substitute if a certain spice is hard to come by, says Dr Lougee.But sometimes the AI isn't all that clever."In the early days of our collaboration, a product developer was trying to make a Cajun rice dish," she says."We tried out our suggestion generation engine and it created a great Cajun spice mix, but it left out all the rice."It hadn't yet learned that you have to take into account the application, so all it had done was create a seasoned salt," she says.Food technology historian Dr Nadia Berenstein says that in a world full of so many food and drink choices there is a "restless search for novelty" in an increasingly competitive industry.And the battleground is flavour.Image copyright The Science of Spice/DK Image caption Dr Stuart Farrimond's "periodic table" of spices in his book The Science of Spice Neelam does admit that technology can play a part, given that spices such as green cardamom and pepper from Kerala have been hard to source recently.AI-suggested alternatives could be useful.But if you don't have access to commercially sensitive databases produced by the largest spice company in the world, Dr Stuart Farrimond, author of The Science of Spice, has come up with a spice-based periodic table for home cooks.He believes people now want to know more about where their food has come from and how it is made."Spices have always been in demand but there appears to have been a rise in flavour transparency because people are interested in health and also what is going into the food that they are cooking," he says.So should traditional spice mix producers fear AI?"AI is just a tool that's available to our generation to be able to do what humans have always done, and that's to explore new tastes and experiences," says Dr Lougee.That may be true, but just don't think of taking away our masala dabba.Follow Dhruti Shah on Twitter @dhrutishah Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Ethiopian Airlines probe: What do we know?:::::Image copyright Jonathan Druion Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed on Sunday morning killing all 157 people on board.It's led to a serious crisis for Boeing.The company manufactured the 737 Max 8 plane that was involved.The model has now been grounded globally as the pressure mounts in a search for answers.Current estimates of the number of 737 Max 8 and 9s grounded ranges from 350 to 370.That represents a significant cost for airlines using the plane as routes, schedules and passengers are affected.The race is on for investigators to find answers - and fast.What do we know?The flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), or black boxes as they are often called, arrived in France on Thursday morning for inspection by the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), the French version of the UK's Air Accident Investigation Branch.Ethiopian inspectors chose to send the black boxes to France even though there are similar facilities in Nigeria, Dubai, Singapore, Germany and here in the UK at Farnborough.But it is the country where the accident happens that makes the decision on where the black boxes go.The BEA in France is a highly respected organisation with considerable expertise in this area.In addition, part of the engines on the Boeing 737 Max 8 are manufactured by a French American conglomerate so this may have played a part.How did they find the black boxes?One of the biggest challenges in air accident investigation is locating the black boxes after a crash.In modern aircraft, the black boxes are fitted at the back of the aircraft as history has shown that this area tends to sustain crash impact better.In the instance of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, the plane is reported to have hit the ground nose first at high speed.The rear of the aircraft was therefore closer to the surface which made it easier to find and retrieve the black boxes.Now they've got the black boxes, what comes next?Firstly, what state are they in?Black boxes are engineered to withstand huge force in order to protect the all-important data chips inside.But the casing could be crushed which means soldering it open.Connectors inside could also be damaged which means starting the analysis could be delayed further.Once data chips are in hand, the information stored needs to be interpreted.Image copyright BEA Image caption The BEA tweeted a picture of a black box from the Ethiopian Airlines plane But the way that data is stored is not the same across the industry.Recording differs between specific aircraft models, operators and airlines.For completely accurate data, conversion information held by Ethiopian Airlines will be necessary.It is hoped that conversion detail is readily available.Each black box holds 25 hours of flight information.The last flight will be the prime focus but previous flights (over the 25 hour period of the recording) are also likely to be looked at to see if there were any anomalies.What about the investigation in Ethiopia?The investigation in Ethiopia will be led by an investigator from that country, but will be assisted by teams from around the world, all with an interest in the crash.The US will have sent investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, as the Boeing 737 Max-8 was manufactured there.It is also thought French investigators are on site due to the black boxes making their way to France.Three investigators from the UK arrived in Ethiopia on Tuesday to provide assistance, but plans are being made for them to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Investigators in Ethiopia are continuing to search for evidence What are the investigators on the ground looking at?How investigators work on the ground differs from country to country dependent on the lead investigator.But generally, separate teams will focus on different disciplines.Core areas include: Engineering: Understanding how the plane's workings, design and systems contributed Operations: Interviewing eye-witnesses, flight crew, operators and regulators Flight data: Black boxes, surveillance and en-route radar, CCTV, still and video cameras Human factors: Understanding how the sequence of events led to the accident.The investigation in the field is only the start of a very long process.Once everything has been documented and photographed, and witnesses have been contacted, the wreckage is usually recovered and transported to a secure facility for extensive analysis.Timing - what can we expect?Work on the black boxes will begin in Paris on Friday.The first image of a black box reveals the damage it sustained after the crash and subsequent explosion.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bereaved families have been paying their respects at the crash site When any data has been extracted, it will then be passed back to the lead investigator in Ethiopia, who will decide on the course of action and what information to release.A former investigator told me that the team in Paris will work day and night because of the global interest in this crash and the impact it is having on airlines, passengers and, most importantly, the bereaved families.Interest in the what happened with Ethiopia Airlines flight 302 has been heightened because of reported similarities with a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October 2018.Both flights were using the Boeing 737 Max 8.But it could be tomorrow, the weekend or next week before we start to get the first answers.
Boeing grounded: What it means for air travel:::::Image copyright Getty Images The grounding of Boeing's 737 Max fleet is expected to cause little air travel disruption - at least for now.The plane-maker grounded its global fleet of the aircraft as a safety precaution after new evidence emerged about a fatal crash involving the jet.The 737 Max is flown by airlines around the world for short trips.Analysts say the initial impact of the grounded jets will be contained, but may escalate if the fleet is not permitted to fly for a longer period.How popular is the 737 Max?The 737 Max has been the fastest-selling aircraft in Boeing's history, with more than 4,500 ordered by 100 different operators globally.But the model still only accounts for a small proportion of travel around the world.Globally, airlines were scheduled to fly just under 700,000 commercial flights this week, data from flight consultancy OAG shows.Of those, 6,548 were due to be operated by a Boeing 737 Max variant."We are talking about just 1% of global flights planned for the aircraft this week," said OAG's John Grant.Which regions will be most affected by the grounded jets?The Boeing 737 Max 8 - the model involved in the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday - is generally used for short-haul and domestic flights.Analysts say North America will face the most disruption as Southwest Airlines, Air Canada and American Airlines are the three largest operators of the 737 Max aircraft in the world.Ellis Taylor, Asia Finance Editor at Flight Global, said the grounding of the aircraft "will have some impact" on US schedules.Still, even if the grounded jets prompts some flight cancellations, analysts expect airlines will be able to accommodate passengers by putting them on other flights, using alternative aircraft or putting old jets back into action."There is plenty of capacity available globally to accommodate this capacity loss for quite a long period of time," OAG's Mr Grant said.Flight Global's Mr Taylor said the scheduled 737 Max flights in the US will mostly run using other jets, but there may be "some inconvenience over the next couple of days as the airlines implement their contingency plans".What will happen next?The level of disruption will depend on how long the 737 Max aircraft are forbidden to fly.That will turn on how long the investigation into what caused the Ethiopian Airlines crash takes, and what the cause is determined to be.It could take some time.A preliminary report on the October Lion Air disaster was released about a month after the crash.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has a team investigating the Ethiopian Airlines crash site, has drawn parallels between the two disasters.Flight Global's Mr Taylor said it now looks more likely the grounding "will extend at least a few weeks, and potentially into a few months, but it all depends on what safety issues are identified".
Classic car industry fears Trump and Brexit roadblock:::::Image copyright Elliot Cuker Image caption Elliot Cuker has seen sales slow sharply For more than four decades Elliot Cuker has been selling classic cars from his garage in New York, but last year he hit a roadblock."I have been in business for 42 years, and 2018 stands out as one of the worst," he says.Now in his 70s, Mr Cuker remembers when his company, Cooper Classics Collection, could sell more than 100 cars a year.Lately, he says, people are buying far fewer."I don't know where things are going right now.I don't know if they'll ever be as strong as they were."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The value of classic cars soared as a result of the global financial crisis While the global financial crisis of 2007-08 was a worrying time for most people, for Mr Cuker and the whole global classic car industry, it marked the start of a decade-long boom.As stock markets slumped, wealthy investors turned to putting their money into luxury assets, such as art, high-end property, expensive wines - and especially classic cars."That was my best year, 2008, believe it or not, when we had that stock market crash," says Mr Cuker."At least you know that if you invest in a car, a classic car, that you have it and it's [at least historically] consistently always gone up in value."Such was the rise in the price of classic cars that one report from insurance firm Axa Art said that the average value of vintage vehicles soared 192% between 2006-17, compared with growth of just 84% across the wider luxury goods sector.But last year, average classic car prices rose just 1%, according to a separate report by classic car index Hagerty Price Guide.Image copyright Elliot Cuker Image caption Classic car prices easily outpaced gains across the wider luxury goods sector in the decade to 2017 While some slowdown is highly likely after such a strong decade of growth, most in the industry blame President Trump's threat to hit car and car parts imports to the US with tariffs of as much as 25%.The president first asked the US Commerce Department to investigate the issue in May last year.Then in November he tweeted that a 25% tariff on imported cars would mean that "many more cars would be built here".With no suggestion that older vehicles and parts will be given an exemption, the Commerce Department filed its confidential report on the issue to President Trump on 17 February.He now has until 18 May to decide whether to hit car imports with a tariff, as he has already done to imported vans.Many in the wider automotive industry expect some kind of import levies.Those in the classic car sector say it would have a substantially negative impact.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: "When you get to tariffs, right now the importation rate to the US on a classic car, or classic car parts is 2.5% [the same as for new cars and parts]," says Rory Jurnecka, features editor at US publication Automobile Magazine."A tenfold increase, when we're talking about tariffs, to 25%, is really unsustainable.And I think will basically bring any global industry, as it pertains to the US, to a halt."But President Trump's tariff threat is not the only issue causing the classic car industry anxiety.The UK's continuing Brexit uncertainty is another factor said to be weighing heavily on the sector.Malcolm Barber, co-chairman of auction house Bonhams, which has its headquarters in London, says Brexit has led to "caution" among UK car collectors "as it has in most industries in Britain".Image copyright Mary Balfour Image caption Rodger Dudding has a vast collection of classic cars Yet despite all this doom and gloom and the current twists in the road, others say that the classic car industry will remain strong.One such person is avid collector Rodger Dudding."I think at the last count I have something like about 430 classic motor vehicles," says the 81-year-old multimillionaire."To my mind, without being too dramatic, they are three-dimensional art."If you look at modern day cars, this model or that model, they're all so similar, and they're boring.They don't have personality."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Classic car collector Rodger Dudding spoke to the BBC in 2018 Mr Dudding, who made his fortune in the self-storage industry, owns nine Ferraris and 24 Aston Martins.He hires out his cars to TV and film productions, such as The Crown and Mary Poppins Returns."We are still investing in cars," he says."We believe the market will be maintained."Image copyright Patrick Ernzen Image caption This Ferrari 250 GTO could have been yours last August, if you had more than $48m to hand This confidence is shared by Kenneth Ahn, president of car auction firm RM Sotheby's.He points to the fact that last August RM Sotheby's sold a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO for $48.4m (36.8m), at an auction in California.This was the most expensive car ever sold at auction."We are optimistic about 2019," says Mr Ahn."Even though there are macro concerns, for truly rare and important cars the collector demand is still very healthy."
Do supermarkets know more about us than we do?:::::Image copyright Getty Images When you buy something at the supermarket, what makes you pick one brand - or one product - over another?Retailers invest huge sums trying to understand this decision-making process, or influence it, in a UK grocery market worth almost 200bn.We know supermarkets can learn a huge amount about us by studying what we buy.But our research also suggests that we form personal bonds with products over time, as we try to self-justify our buying decisions.In short, we do not just buy what we prefer, we end up preferring what we buy; and this means we are more open to influence than we might think.Analysing the decisions we make in the supermarket can help us understand the choices we make in other areas of our lives.Shaped by our choices To explore shoppers' decision-making, we collected more than a million till receipts from one of the UK's major supermarket chains over several years.Unsurprisingly, we discovered that people's purchases reveal what they value and what their aims are.These range from very specific goals such as making a stir-fry, to general goals such as reducing their overall spending.Image copyright Getty Images But our relationships with products go a step further, according to a second study involving loyalty card customers.Analysing the buying decisions of 280,000 customers revealed that they fell into a self-reinforcing cycle, where they became more and more attached to a product.These cycles tend to last for several consecutive store visits before the pattern is broken and the process starts again with a different brand.Interestingly, when consumers break out of these self-reinforcing loops, they tend to do so across multiple products at a time.For example, when switching their brand of coffee, they are more likely to change their brands of yoghurt and washing detergent as well.Blind loyalty Why does this loyalty build up?Further analysis of the data ruled out simpler explanations, such as price or force of habit being responsible for these patterns.One explanation is that people come to like what they purchase, out of a need to "make sense" and explain their choices to themselves and others.For example, after buying the ingredients for a salad, a consumer might start to value healthy foods more to justify the purchase.This pattern of behaviour could be exploited to try to create a relationship with a selected product.In the loyalty card study, we sent the supermarket's instant coffee drinking customers coupons to try a different brand.Those in the switching phase were twice as likely to use the coupon as those still locked in to their existing coffee product.Beyond shopping This self-justified decision making is not limited to the weekly shop, but probably spills over to many areas of our lives.For example, studies suggest people defend their selection of everything from the jam they buy to the politicians they decide to vote for in an election.After we vote for a leader we may mimic their positions on many issues, including those we were undecided about or even to which we were opposed.More stories like this Finding a 'hidden gem' Image copyright Getty Images Human decision-making can sometimes be more logical, with takeaway food choices one example of this.A wide-ranging study looked at users of a popular food delivery app in 197 cities, to deduce how they decided from which restaurant to order.It is natural to think the app's users make their ordering decision based on ratings and popularity.In reality, we found they were more interested in finding "hidden gems" with fewer positive reviews.This may seem counter-intuitive and wrong, but this is actually how sophisticated machine-learning systems deal with uncertainty.The more reviews a restaurant has, the more trustworthy the rating is.When a restaurant only has a few reviews, even if they are not very positive, there is still a decent chance that the restaurant will be excellent.After all, those few reviewers may just be off the mark.In contrast, when a restaurant has many good - but not excellent - reviews, the odds are vanishingly small that the restaurant is exceptional.In effect, customers prefer to take a chance on greatness rather than a guarantee of mediocrity.Image copyright Getty Images We found that people ordering in cities with better restaurants are more likely to take risks.This is a smart move, because you are more likely to chance upon an excellent restaurant in a city with a good food scene.However, our research indicates that when people do explore and are burned by a bad experience, they return to familiar and unhealthy choices, like hamburgers.A method to the madness Although consumers might not be aware of it, their purchases reveal a great deal about them.While they may appear to be mindlessly browsing food delivery options after a night out, the data trail they leave reveals a method to the madness.We now know that when loyalty to one product is broken, consumers are likely to switch other products too.Shoppers could take advantage of this window to replace bad habits with good ones, but could also be more susceptible to advertisements for new products.Our understanding of human decision-making is improving all the time.Combined with advancements in AI, this could help unlock not just our food choices but all of the decisions that we make.About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.Brad Love is a fellow at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national centre for data science and artificial intelligence.He is also professor of Cognitive and Decision Sciences at University College London.You can follow him on Twitter here.Professor Love has previously worked as a consultant for Customer Data Science company dunnhumby.Edited by Eleanor Lawrie
Meet Tengai, the job interview robot who won't judge you:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Would you be happy being interviewed by a robot?The world's first robot designed to carry out unbiased job interviews is being tested by Swedish recruiters.But can it really do a better job than humans?Her name is Tengai.Measuring 41cm (16in) tall and weighing 3.5kg (7.7lbs) she's at eye level as she sits on top of a table directly across from the candidate she's about to interview.Her glowing yellow face tilts slightly to the side.Then she blinks and smiles lightly as she poses her first question: "Have you ever been interviewed by a robot before?"Tengai is the brainchild of Furhat Robotics, an artificial intelligence (AI) and social robotics company born out of a research project at Stockholm's KTH Royal Institute of Technology.The firm has spent the past four years building a human-like computer interface that mimics the way we speak, as well as our subtle facial expressions.The idea, according to chief scientist Gabriel Skantze, is that "it feels much less scary or strange compared to a more traditional robot".Since October 2018, the start-up's been collaborating with one of Sweden's largest recruitment firms, TNG.The goal is to offer candidates job interviews that are free from any of the unconscious biases that managers and recruiters can often bring to the hiring process, while still making the experience "seem human".Image caption Elin berg Mrtenzon from recruitment agency TNG hopes Tengai will standardise interviews "It typically takes about seven seconds for someone to make a first impression and about five to 15 minutes for a recruiter to make a decision.We want to challenge that," explains Elin berg Mrtenzon, chief innovation officer at TNG's office in central Stockholm.Unconscious biases include making assumptions about someone's competence based on gender, ethnicity, voice, education, appearance, or as a result of informal conversations before or after an interview."For example, if I ask you a question at the beginning of the process like: 'Do you play golf?'and you say: 'Yes I do, I love playing golf', and I do too, then in some way I will put that in a positive box," says Ms Mrtenzon.Tengai, by contrast, doesn't engage in pre-interview chit-chat and poses all questions in an identical way, in the same tone, and typically, in the same order.This is thought to create a fairer and more objective interview.Recruiters or managers are then given text transcripts of each interview to help them decide which candidates should move to the next stage of the process, based on the answers alone.Image caption Recruiter Petra Elisson has been putting Tengai through her paces "I think it is a really good help while screening - if you have a big recruitment process with a lot of candidates - having someone, a robot, with no emotions, no feelings," says Petra Elisson, a 50-year-old who works in healthcare recruitment.She has been taking part in the trials, both as a recruiter analysing candidates transcripts and as an interviewee."I was quite sceptical at first before meeting Tengai, but after the meeting I was absolutely struck," she reflects."At first I really, really felt it was a robot, but when going more deeply into the interview I totally forgot that she's not human."But robots are programmed by humans, analyse datasets compiled by humans, and learn from human behaviour, so couldn't they inherit some of our biases?Furhat Robotics says it has sought to stop this by carrying out multiple test interviews using a diverse pool of volunteers."It's learning from several different recruiters so it doesn't pick up the specific behaviour of one recruiter," explains the start-up's chief scientist, Gabriel Skantze.Image caption Furhat Robotics' Gabriel Skantze says Tengai is trained to avoid human biases Following several months of trials, Tengai will start interviewing candidates for real later in May.Recruiters and developers are also working on an English-language version of the robot which is expected to be rolled out by early 2020.The goal is that she will eventually be sophisticated enough to decide for herself whether a candidate can move forward to the next stage of recruitment, avoiding the need for a human to review interview transcripts."Before we completely rely on that, we have to make sure that there is no bias in our data," explains Mr Skantze.Sweden does offer an especially interesting test bed for AI recruitment.As well as being a small country with a reputation for early adoption when it comes to new technologies, ethnic diversity in the labour market is a particularly hot topic following record immigration in recent years.Unemployment among native Swedes is around 4%, but for citizens born abroad the figure is more than 15%.Compare that to the UK, where 5% of foreign-born citizens are without a job.Image caption Bulgarian job seeker Ekaterina would welcome bias-free interview robots A recent survey for TNG suggested that 73% of job seekers in Sweden believe they have been discriminated against while applying for a job on the basis of their ethnicity, age, gender, sexual preferences, appearance, weight, health or disability."Swedish culture is very risk-averse, so normally they like the safe card... the Swedish person," says one Bulgarian job seeker who wants to be known only by her first name, Ekaterina, waiting outside a city centre employment agency.Ekaterina believes robots such as Tengai could be "great as a first step" in the recruitment process, because they "don't have any stereotypes about your dialect or accent or where you come from".The technology has also been championed by Diversity Foundation, a non-political, non-profit organisation that campaigns for more inclusion in the Swedish labour market."Any method that emphasises competency and skills over things like ethnicity is a welcome development and truly part of the Swedish innovation spirit," says chief operating officer Matt Kriteman.More Technology of Business A growing number of AI tools and technologies are being tested around the world in the field of recruitment.Among the most high-profile is HireVue, a US-based video platform that enables candidates to be interviewed at any time of day and uses algorithms to evaluate their answers and facial expressions.Seedlink, which has offices in Amsterdam and Shanghai, asks candidates to answer questions on their smartphones, and analyses their language to see if they're the right cultural fit for a role.And UK start-up JamieAi focuses on matching candidates with the right credentials for relevant job openings, seeking to eliminate bias by excluding demographic factors, such as name, age or ethnicity.Image copyright Dr Malin Lindelw Image caption Dr Malin Lindelw has several concerns about the use of robots in recruitment Swedish recruiter TNG says interviewees have enjoyed their encounters with Tengai.But some professionals have concerns.Dr Malin Lindelw, a Swedish psychologist who specialises in recruitment, says: "Recruiting is very much a leap of faith.It's a huge investment.It's a huge commitment.And you need to believe in the decision that you make."I find it very difficult to believe that recruiting managers will rely on a robot."She also points out that interviews - especially those in sectors where there is a skills shortage - can be as much about job seekers deciding whether or not they want to work for a company as the reverse."The candidate will come to the interview thinking: 'Is this a place where I want to work?'Is this somebody I want to work with?'They get their own gut feeling and it will affect their decision a great deal," she says."I am very concerned about what robots may do to that part of the process."
No-deal Brexit and how businesses are planning for it:::::Image copyright Ian Davies, Brussels Street Studio We're still no clearer on what will happen on 29 March when the UK is set to leave the European Union.The prime minister doesn't seem any closer to getting a deal finalised and leaving without one remains an option.If that happens it means the UK would leave the EU and cut ties immediately, with no agreement at all in place.Some economists warn that it could mean businesses have to pay more to send their products to countries in the rest of EU.The government says it's planning for a no-deal and told businesses to do the same.Radio 1 Newsbeat has been chatting to people who run their own companies to find out if they're preparing.'Keeping things local' Image copyright Alex Leslie Wyman Image caption Harvey and Rory are founders of Matcha Work Harvey Hodd is 23 and runs Matcha Works with his friend Rory Jeffries.They're a range of iced lattes containing matcha green teas with plant-based milks, including almond, coconut and oat milk.Harvey says the main thing they're trying to do is keep everything they do in the UK."A lot of manufacturing, especially for beverage companies, is in Europe or further afield."We had an option of working with a manufacturer in Austria but decided to stay in the UK because of the worries around Brexit."We thought if we can get something closer to home, yes, it's more expensive but it would safeguard against any future supply issues."Image copyright Alex Leslie Wyman Image caption Matcha Works was founded in 2018 The drink's main ingredient is plant-based milk, which Harvey says is hard to find in the UK."We formulated our own range of milks, but obviously we have to source the almonds, the coconuts and the oats."It's all well and good working directly with someone, but that doesn't create a supply chain, so we've had to find partners we can work with in the UK but it's really hard."Harvey says keeping things local means the cost goes up but there are benefits to keeping things in the UK "There's more control over the manufacturing if it's closer to home which is a benefit and is a strategic move and we can work in smaller quantities."'I'm optimistic about future deals' Image copyright Brussels Street Studio Image caption Jack Thompson and Amelia Watson have high hopes for Brexit In Leeds, Leave voter Jack Thompson and Amelia Watson, both 22, have a make-up company called MEMI.It's an online business that started in 2017, which has most of its customers in Europe.These two aren't preparing for a no-deal Brexit - they're going to wait and see what happens instead."In Parliament there might be a new development that can alter the direction of Brexit."We've taken the decision to wait and see before we restructure any of the business as one wrong decision could be costly."Jack told Newsbeat there are some things they'd have to consider if the UK left the EU without a deal.Image copyright Simon Lyle Ritchie Image caption MEMI is aimed at 16 to 22-year-olds "At the moment we have the free trade deals so we can depend on quick and reliable delivery, that's why we can have a shipping cost of 5.99."If we leave with no deal and we leave the customs union we would have to increase our shipping rate for international sales by about 3."We could end up paying a lot to ship large amounts of stock to Germany or France - that would impact our margins as we would have to factor in the cost customs checks."But he is optimistic about Brexit and any trade deals the government can do with other countries.Jack told Newsbeat: "I voted to leave and I stand by my vote."Depending on what trade deals we get outside of the EU, that could potentially be a massive help for us so we are hoping for free trade deals with the US and Australia," he adds.'It's a constant worry for me' Image copyright Ian Davies Image caption Jocelyn Evans has helped develop more than 40 brands Jocelyn Evans is 28 and runs a manufacturing company in Birmingham called Hook and Eye UK.She helps new or small clothes brands turn their designs into real products - she says she's helped set up more than 40.She voted to stay in the EU and says she's thinking out of the box to prepare for Brexit."Instead of offering the customers physical goods I am trying to offer more digital support."I think that's the only way people can get through a no deal Brexit - think of innovative ways to provide a business and still avoid costs."Joss told Radio 1 Newsbeat she thinks about Brexit a lot and worries about it too."I don't know what the full effects of a no deal Brexit will be to my business."If we come out of the EU and there are no trade deals that is going to put the price up on everything - it's a constant worry for me."Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.
‘I sold my wedding presents to set up my company’:::::Image copyright Twilio Image caption Jeff Lawson's entrepreneurial streak was first evident when he was 13 The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to Jeff Lawson, co-founder and chief executive of US technology company Twilio.Jeff Lawson was all set to secure investment in his new start-up Twilio when suddenly people thought the world might be collapsing.Back on Monday, 15 September 2008, Jeff and his two co-founders walked into a meeting with potential investors in Silicon Valley.Getting the funding was supposed to be "almost a formality", remembers Jeff, who was 31 at the time.Unfortunately, US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed on the Sunday night, one of the most shocking moments of the then global financial crisis.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lehman Brothers' demise caused Twilio some problems "We walk in, and it's like chequebooks closed," says Jeff."People were wondering: 'Is the world melting?!'"My co-founders and I looked at each other and thought: 'Maybe this is a dumb idea.Maybe you know, maybe this is just stupid.'"The idea that Jeff and colleagues Evan Cooke and John Wolthuis had was a software business that helps companies automate communications with their users, be it by text message, or telephone and video calls.Fast forward to today, and San Francisco-based Twilio is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and worth more than $14bn (10.5bn).With annual revenue of $650m in 2018, its thousands of customers include Uber, WhatsApp, Coca-Cola, AirBnB, Twitter, eBay, and UK retailer Marks & Spencer.So when you get a text message from your Uber driver, Twilio's technology probably handles that interaction.The same if you telephone M&S - Twilio's technology will route the call.Or if you get a notification via numerous firms' mobile phone apps.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Uber is one of Twilio's major customers Back in September 2008 the success of Twilio was still a world away.After the funding had fallen though, Jeff says he felt as if the company - which they started work on in March of that year - was back at square one.But determined to carry on, he and his co-founders borrowed money from family and friends to get started on what techies refer to as the MVP - minimum viable product.As in, the most basic incarnation of their idea.When that first pot of money started to run out, Jeff - with the blessing of his wife Erica - sold their wedding presents.Twilio's first client was a man who had designed a website to help people find their missing mobile phone.You'd visit the site, input the number, pay a dollar, and it would ring your phone.Jeff and his colleagues made the process more automated.Hardly world-changing, but a client is a client.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jeff is a regular speaker at tech events A big break came in November 2008 when Twilio decided to show off its technology by pranking the most influential tech blogger of that era, Michael Arrington, founder of tech news website TechCrunch.It did this by telephoning him a recording of the pop song Never Gonna Give You Up by UK singer Rick Astley.At the time there was a craze to play the song unexpectedly, a phenomenon that was given the term "rickrolling".The publicity Twilio gained caught the attention of record label Sony Music, which called Jeff the next day."There was a guy who was a manager of one of their bands," says Jeff, now 41."And he said: 'Look, we've been trying to have this little promotion where the band records a voicemail, and we blast it out to fans who opt into this.Can we build it?'"I told him: 'Yeah sure, I've never heard of that idea.'"With Sony Music on board as a client, Jeff was able to go back to the same investors who had previously turned him down.This time they said yes, and Twilio secured $1m of seed funding at the start of 2009.It went on to raise $261m in investment, and in 2016 it floated on the stock market.Today it has 16 offices in 10 countries, and 1,275 employees.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As is the custom, Jeff was there in person when Twilio floated on the New York Stock Exchange Twilio's business model sees it charge companies for every communication with a customer.For a simple text message in the US the fee is $0.0075.That doesn't sound like much at all, but when a business is texting tens of millions of customers it can soon add up.Growing up in Detroit, Jeff's entrepreneurialism can be traced back to when, aged 13, he launched a video production company, despite knowing very little about it."My first event was a three-year-old's birthday party," he says."By the time I graduated high school I was doing full wedding videos, and I made $15,000 for that.So I graduated high school with a lot of money saved up."Also learning to code as a teenager, he wrote computer programs for his father's company, which provided the software for industrial printers.More The Boss features: Jeff then juggled doing a computer science and film and video course at the University of Michigan with business interests including running a company called Notes for Free.This offered college students a way to share notes and study material online.Senior jobs at ticketing firm StubHub and Amazon then followed, before the idea for Twilio was born.The company's success is down in part to its terrific timing - it emerged just as businesses were realising that customers, particularly the younger ones, would rather get a text message than have to make a phone call.Or if they did need to make a call, they were simply not prepared to sit on hold.However, it has not all been plain sailing for the business, with its shares slumping in 2016 and 2017 as it missed Wall Street's earnings targets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Auction and retail website eBay is another company that uses Twilio's technology Alex Wilhelm, editor in chief of Crunchbase, a website that tracks tech investments, says: "Starting in mid-2016 Twilio went into Wall Street purgatory, losing more than half its value and seeing its stock stagnate until early 2018."Since then the company has been on a tear, appreciating rapidly and drawing accolades from media and investors alike.Twilio now has to prove that its sky-high revenue multiple is not dangerously inflated and that it can increase profitability while growing into its $14bn valuation."On a day-to-day basis Jeff says that Twilio staff are encouraged to solve problems on their own, without the need for hand-holding by bosses.To counteract the possibility for reckless decision making, the company also tells employees that there should be "no shenanigans".It is more straightforward, Jeff argues, than a vague, loftier declaration like "have integrity"."I know what the word integrity means," he says."But do I really know if what I'm doing right now has integrity?It can be hard to tell."But shenanigans you know, you know shenanigans."
Brexit: 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal:::::Image copyright Getty Images The EU has said Brexit can be delayed from 29 March by two weeks, with that date being pushed back further if Theresa May's withdrawal agreement gets through Parliament.But if MPs still don't agree on it, the UK has to propose a way forward - and European Council President Donald Tusk has said that the UK government would face "a choice between a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50".With all options still on the table, how would you be affected if the UK leaves the EU with no deal?1.The contents of your shopping basket may change What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects.About 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more expensive in the event of no deal.Increased import taxes and transport delays could all mean a rise in prices.And if a no-deal Brexit was followed by a fall in the value of the pound, that would also have the same effect.Supermarkets themselves have already warned that there could be empty shelves and higher prices.And Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that, in a worst-case scenario, our shopping bills could increase by 10%.The government has said that while a no-deal Brexit alone won't lead to food shortages, consumer behaviour could.Panic buying could mean food retailers run short of some products.Supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg.2.You will need to take extra measures when travelling to Europe Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe.If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork.Flights and Eurostar The government and the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) have both said that flights to and from the UK would still operate in a no-deal scenario.And Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensure their services run as smoothly as possible, despite a government assessment that warned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK.Visas In terms of paperwork, you won't need a visa for stays in countries in the Schengen area - where passports are not required and all other types of border control have been abolished (full list here) - of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period.However, you may need a visa if you intend to stay for longer.Passports Image copyright PA The government is also advising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months if you are travelling to the Schengen area.Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document.But the government has now warned that this time carried over will not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit.You can check if your passport has enough time left with this government tool.For countries that are in the EU but not in the Schengen area (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), you'll need to check the entry requirements for the country you're travelling to before you travel.Travel to Ireland is subject to separate Common Travel Area arrangements, which will remain the same after the UK leaves the EU.Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (the European Economic Area), the government has warned that it may become more expensive.European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, then in theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist.The government is advising travellers to buy insurance to cover health care "just as you would if visiting a non-EU country".Driving If you intend to drive in the EU after exit, you may need an International Driving Permit and a green card from your insurer.3.You may need to check medication is available and it may be more expensive Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU.Measures taken include: a six-week stockpile of essential medicines a plane chartered to fly in medical devices and clinical consumables that can't be stockpiled warehouses with refrigeration capacity rented ports other than Dover and Folkestone prepared to take ferries with lorries carrying imported medical supplies However, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society warned in January that pharmacists were struggling to obtain common medicines - including painkillers and anti-depressants.While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there are concerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse.Pharmacists have advised patients to order medicines in advance to give them time to deal with requests.And the Royal College of Radiologists has told doctors to prepare for delays in some drugs used to detect cancer, by reducing their workload in the days after the UK leaves the EU.4.UK nationals living abroad may have to take extra measures About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries.The government is advising UK nationals living in the EU, the EEA or Switzerland to take steps to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.These will differ according to the country being lived in.The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country.There is country-specific government advice here.Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU.If you are eligible, you should register for healthcare under your country's local rules.You may have to be a long-term legal resident or pay social security contributions to access free or discounted healthcare.The government recommends you get health insurance while you are applying for residency.UK students studying abroad are also advised to buy health insurance.Information on how to access healthcare abroad can be found on the NHS website.Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU.Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements.These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income/gain, and determine which country has primary taxing rights.5.EU citizens need to apply for 'settled status' The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members who are living in the UK.There are currently 3.8 million EU citizens living in the UK.If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has a tool to find out what you need to do and when.Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button 6.Importing goods from the EU may get more expensive Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure.As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU.But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply.Earlier this month, the government published a 1,477-page document outlining their plan for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Under the temporary scheme, 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access.At the moment 80% of imports are tariff free.Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture.Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection.7.House prices could be affected Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market.UK house prices grew at the slowest annual rate for nearly six years in January, according to the Nationwide.It said it was likely that the recent slowdown in the market was due to "the impact of the uncertain economic outlook on buyer sentiment".The Bank of England says the impact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant.It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a "disorderly Brexit".Property agents Savills suggest buyer confidence will have a bigger role to play than affordability in house price movements this year.8.Mobile phone roaming charges may rise Using your mobile in the EU may be more expensive in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government has warned.The amounts EU mobile operators would be able to charge UK operators for providing roaming services would no longer be regulated after Brexit.Digital, Culture and Media Secretary Jeremy Wright has said although mobile operators will be able to implement roaming charges if they want to, the government would be legislating to put a 45-a-month limit on the amount customers could be charged.To be safe, the government advises you to understand how to turn off data roaming on your mobile if you are worried about being charged.9.Some ports and motorways could see extra delays Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said there could be freight traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no deal, if additional customs checks are introduced in Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk - where freight services disembark.At the moment, freight vehicles going through Dover are subject to passport and security checks.But under a no-deal scenario, EU-bound lorries will also need to complete customs declarations, and certain goods may also require physical checks, and this could lead to bottlenecks.In this scenario, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20.Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side.If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used.Kent County Council says it has employed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal.10.UK students studying in the EU and EU students studying in the UK face a period of uncertainty More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17.UK universities say they would expect a similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.The government is committed to funding everything already agreed, so people who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them.But if the UK leaves the EU without a deal before the exchanges for the next academic year have been finalised, then the government would need European agreement to keep taking part.It has issued a technical note explaining this.That is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK.Meanwhile, Universities UK has launched a campaign supporting opportunities for studying abroad.Remind yourself of the Brexit basics with: .
Ethiopian Airlines: What do we know about Boeing 737 Max 8?:::::Image copyright Jonathan Druion Image caption The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed on Sunday The Ethiopian Airlines tragedy marks the second fatal crash within five months involving a new type of Boeing aircraft.The Boeing 737 Max 8 has only been in commercial use since 2017.In October last year a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max went down shortly after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board.That aircraft was less than three months old.Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 also went down just minutes after take-off.The aircraft - registration ET-AVJ - first flew in October 2018, according to flight tracking websites.How the plane differed from previous model Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman told the BBC the 737 Max's "engine is a bit further forward and a bit higher in relation to the wing, compared to the previous version of the plane.That affects the balance of the plane".The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee indicated that Lion Air flight 610 experienced "erroneous input" from one of its sensors designed to alert pilots if the aeroplane is at risk of stalling.The inquiry has not yet reached any final conclusions about the cause of the disaster.The sensor and connected software work in a different way to previous models of the 737, but pilots had not been told that.Within days of the Lion Air crash, the aircraft maker Boeing issued an operations bulletin to airlines.The US aviation regulator then issued an "emergency" airworthiness directive to US carriers about this sensor - a so-called Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor.The Federal Aviation Administration said the sensor "condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain".Who was sent the emergency alert?US airlines were told to update information flight manuals for air crew.At the time the FAA said the information was passed on to other national aviation regulators.The expectation was that regulators would inform airlines and they in turn would update pilots.Aviation sources say it almost certain that Ethiopian Airlines pilots would have been updated on the sensor issue.There is no immediate evidence to suggest the Ethiopia Airlines jet has encountered the same difficulties as the Lion Air flight.Aviation analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting told the BBC: "There will be attention to the fact that this was a very new aircraft, the same type as that involved in the recent Lion Air accident and in a similar phase of flight - but detailed work taking time will be required to establish the cause."What's Boeing's response?In a statement on Sunday, Boeing said a "technical team is prepared to provide technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board".It has also said it extended its "heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board and stand ready to support the Ethiopian Airlines team".The Boeing 737 Max has been the fastest-selling aircraft in Boeing's history, with more than 4,500 ordered by 100 different operators globally.The initial findings of the investigation in Ethiopia will determine what action regulators and airlines take.Ethiopian Airlines is regarded as Africa's leading airline.Analyst John Strickland said it is "also recognised globally as a high-quality professionally-run company".
Wonky spud vodka couple eye export market:::::Image caption Graeme and Caroline Jarron reckon there is demand for their vodka overseas A potato-farming couple who make vodka using spuds which are too "wonky" to sell in supermarkets are planning to sell their product across the globe.Caroline and Graeme Jarron have been distilling Ogilvy Vodka at their Angus farm since 2014.They have found it tough selling in the UK, but believe there could be big demand for their product in places like the US and Middle East.The couple have also opened a 150,000 vodka visitor centre at their farm.Now, they are driving forward plans to take their product global."We're actively looking at opportunities in the Middle East and in America," Caroline told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme."I think there's some big vodka-drinking markets globally, the trend being gin in the UK at the moment so that's been a tougher market for us."We are up against the mainstream vodkas and that's quite tough for us in terms of pricing - we're a lot more expensive to produce our vodka."Caroline said making the first batch of vodka for sale came at the end of a long process."We have potatoes that we sell to supermarkets, but there's the wonky ones - the ones that are too big, too small, a bit ugly," she said."We didn't know what to do with those ones so it was frustration with that and trying to find a use for them that led us to this."Image copyright Photographer: Jakub Iwanicki Image caption The vodka is made using misshapen potatoes that would not normally make it onto supermarket shelves The wife and husband team first worked with Heriot-Watt University's brewing and distilling department."Graeme drove down week after week with sacks of potatoes and they took it on as a bit of a test project," said Caroline.They then spent another seven months perfecting the process, before settling on Maris Piper as the perfect potato with which to make vodka.Scotland's spirits industry is best-known for making whisky, while the number of gin producers has been growing steadily."We've gone against the trend, but tried to do something a bit different to stand out from the crowd," said Caroline."There has been this big boom in gin - but a lot of them buy in the base spirit.We grow the potatoes, we distil it and we bottle it all on the farm ourselves."Graeme and Caroline are also hoping their new visitor centre will attract 3,000 people in its first year, by providing a behind-the-scenes look at how a potato vodka distillery works."A lot of people approached us to see if we do tours, and we haven't had the facility to do it up until know," said Caroline."We are something different.We're not whisky, we're not gin.People are really keen to see how we produce it."For more on this story and the latest business news as it happens, follow BBC presenter Andrew Black's updates each weekday morning on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme between 0600 and 0900.
