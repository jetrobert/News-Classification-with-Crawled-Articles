Meghan Markle is ‘not a yes person’ and ‘speaks her mind’ like an American woman, says Princess Diana’s butler:::::When it comes to the rumored royal feud between Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle and Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, Princess Dianas former butler isnt buying it.They are different women with different roles from different cultures, Paul Burrell told Us Weekly Thursday.Kate knows that Meghan is no threat to her, and Meghan is mature enough to realize that her role is vastly different to Kates.PRINCE HARRY AND MEGHAN MARKLE ANNOUNCE BIRTH PLANS FOR ROYAL BABY The first signs of a reported feud came in November 2018, when The Telegraph reported that Markle made Middleton cry over an argument involving bridesmaid dresses for her May 2018 wedding to Britains Prince Harry.The alleged tension between the two duchesses, both 37 years old, has been widely rumored as the reason behind the announcement of Markle and Harry moving out of Londons Kensington Palace, where Middleton resides with her husband and Harrys older brother, Prince William, 36.Markle and Harry are expecting their first child sometime this spring.Burrell, 60, previously served as a footman to Harry and Williams grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, before he began working for their mother Diana, the late Princess of Wales.He doesnt believe there is any jealousy between Markle and Middleton, but he is sure that they have differences of opinion.OPRAH WINFREY SAYS MEGHAN MARKLE IS 'BEING PORTRAYED UNFAIRLY' I have no doubt that Meghan is not a yes person, said Burrell to Us Weekly.[She] speaks her mind and voices her opinions as an American woman of today would and should.Despite Markle being a former Hollywood actress before she officially joined the British royal family, Burrell believed the Suits alum will have a great influence on the man she loves even though he will never be king.Harry, 34, is currently sixth in line to the royal throne.More recently, there was speculation that William and Harry had a rift over Markle.However, Burrell told Us Weekly he doesnt believe the dukes went through a rough patch either.They may have differences as they are two very different personalities, he explained.I think that their life bond was forged at the time of their mothers death and that they are inseparable.MEGHAN MARKLE 'SHUNNING' QUEEN ELIZABETH'S DOCTORS FOR DELIVERY OF ROYAL BABY: REPORT Diana passed away in 1997 at age 36 from injuries she sustained in a car crash.Royal expert Rebecca Long told Us Weekly Wednesday while Markle is gearing up to welcome her first child, Middleton is more focused on preparing to become the future queen of England.She explained Middletons first-ever solo outing with Elizabeth, 92, at Kings College London in mid-March was design to prepare the duchess for her most important role.Middleton became a member of the British royal family when she married William, who is second in line to the throne, in 2011.The couple share three children: Princes George and Louis, as well as Princess Charlotte.Kates been taking on new responsibilities little by little over the last few years, so it wont be a shock when the time comes, Long explained.William and Kate are the favorite royals to take the crown in many generations, so the people of the U.K. are very excited about it.MEGHAN MARKLE, PRINCE HARRY SHATTER INSTAGRAM RECORDS Elizabeth is also determined to show Middleton how to settle into her future title gracefully in the public eye.Shes really taken Kate under her wing, a source close to the royal family told Us Weekly.The two of them will often spend hours discussing royal life and the future of the monarchy.Its taken a long time for Kate to get to where she is today, added a second insider.But shes ready.Earlier this month, royal expert Katie Nicholl told Glamour magazine that rumors of an alleged feud between Middleton and Markle are greatly exaggerated, but that doesnt mean the sisters-in-law are necessarily eager to hang out together."I think this idea of there being a catfight between the two duchesses has made tantalizing headlines, but I don't believe that," Nicholl told Glamour."I've never heard from my sources that there has ever been a feud or a falling out."MEGHAN MARKLE AND KATE MIDDLETON WILL NEVER BE BEST FRIENDS, ROYAL EXPERT CLAIMS However, Nicholl says there is one rumored incident between the royal wives that she does think holds some water."I had heard about an upset over the dress fitting for Princess Charlotte," Nicholl said, referring to Markle allegedly making Middleton cry ahead of Prince Harry's royal wedding."And I had heard that while Harry was very keen for the two of them to become best friends, there was never that sort of a friendship.""I know in the early days Kate invited Meghan over to apartment 1A for tea.Obviously, she took her on that high-profile trip to Wimbledon, so they have spent time together.But what I think hasn't happened is they haven't become best friends out of all of it," Nicholl said."That's not to say they hate each other.I don't believe that to be the case at all.""They quite quickly realized they were two pretty mature women quite different women and really the only thing they had in common was they'd married princes," Nicholl explained."Not just Prince Harry, I think probably the world wanted them to become best friends."However, Nicholl does believe that Prince Harry and Prince William may not have seen eye to eye recently.Reports suggested that William warned Harry not to rush into marriage with Markle, while allegedly "riled" Harry.WILL MEGHAN MARKLE'S ROYAL BABY BE AN AMERICAN CITIZEN?"I do think there is some truth to there having been some tension not just between the duchesses but between the dukes, as well," Nicholl said."As we all know, things can gather momentum pretty quickly.So while I think there's been tension, I don't believe there has been some feud."As for Markle and Middleton's recent highly publicized hug, Nicholl says that was a strategic move."I do know that Meghan and Kate have come to an agreement to get along, to make an effort, to be amiable and warm toward each other in public," she said."They both realize it's in neither of their interests to have these catfight headlines.It's not what either of them wants."
Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Veronica Pome’e says she ‘screamed and cried’ before sizzling photo shoot:::::Veronica Pomees life forever changed when she received a phone call from Sports Illustrated Swimsuit editor MJ Day.Back in March, Glamour Magazine UK reported the 29-year-old was one of six finalists for the 2019 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model search competition, making her the first Polynesian woman to pose for the magazine.SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT MODEL SAYS SHE'S '54 AND PROUD OF IT' Pomees family comes the Kingdom of Tonga, a small island nation in the South Pacific.The day that I received the call from MJ Day, I screamed, I dropped my phone and then I cried, the plus-size pinup told Fox News.I forgot she was on the phone.Its one of those experiences where you dont really know whats going on, but you have so much excitement, you have so much gratitude.I didnt even know what to say to her.The first thing that came to mind was, I cant wait to tell my parents.The Perris, Calif. native, who is signed to Wilhelmina Models, said she took a chance when she decided to participate in the model search during the summer of last year.Glamour Magazine UK reported the editors whittled down 10,000 audition tapes from the open-call competition to a pool of 16 finalists, before narrowing them down again to six models who will appear in the upcoming issue.Pomee soon found herself soaking up the sun in the Bahamas in front of photographers.CAMILLE KOSTEK NAMED 2019 SPORTS ILLUSTRATED ROOKIE I was really nervous, she explained.I was always the bigger girl, the bigger plus size model.[But] having girls like Ashley Graham, Hunter McGrady and Tabria Majors, having them pioneer this force in the industry to be reckoned with it just made me feel so much more comfortable and confident.That day, although I was nervous, when we went on set, every fear or insecurity or doubt just vanished, Pomee continued.Im here to represent the vast majority of women who dont feel represented, and to encourage them to feel comfortable and more confident in their bodies.I feel honored and privileged to be in that lineup with those other women who are doing the same thing.I can say that Im part of the change.Im part of this conversation that we need to have.But breaking down barriers isnt always smooth sailing.Pomee, who has nearly 40,000 followers on Instagram, admitted shes still learning how to deal with online bullies who are quick to share harsh criticism.Thankfully, shes received some guidance from Sports Illustrated Swimsuits newest rookie.Tara Lynn, whos one of the top curvy models in the world gave me some great advice about how she handles her trolls, said Pomee.If they come and leave a hateful comment on her Instagram, shell go back and comment something really something nice and sweet on there.It just changes the whole energy.Its like, Wow, I just said some really hateful things to her and shes still being super nice and sweet to me.That was a good way to just change [how] I take in those hateful comments.Sometimes, those people dont even really understand who they are, so they inflict that type of insecurity that they have on other people.LINDSEY VONN TEASES RETURN TO SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT ISSUE And while being the first Polynesian model has plenty of perks, Pomee insisted the title comes with great responsibility one she refuses to take lightly.Now that Im here, in that position, I understand that theres so much more to it, said Pomee.Im [learning] a lot about kids in Fiji and not just Polynesia itself but Micronesia, Melanesia the kids are really celebrating me.They have pictures, printed-out posters of me, all over the island.And when they found out that I made the top six, everyone was cheering me on.Hearing that just makes me feel like theres so much more responsibility for me on this platform.[I just want to] really raise awareness that people come from those small islands.Maybe they are unheard and unseen and feel like theyre not part of the world, but we very much are.I have the opportunity to really shed light on that, so it makes me feel proud.Pomee shared that her parents are just as excited over the sizzling snaps and feel her image will truly shine a light on her roots.I dont think they really understand the magnitude of Sports Illustrated and the platform, she chuckled.And I like that because for me, theres so much more than I want to really show them and just make them proud as a daughter and first generation of immigrant parents.SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT ANNOUNCES KELSEY MERRITT AS THEIR NEW ROOKIE But these days, Pomee isnt sitting back and waiting for her highly anticipated issue to hit newsstands in May.Shes keeping busy, working on a cause that hits close to home.Pomee is currently working with Hon.Frederica Tuita Filipe, a member of the Tongan royal family, to bring awareness on the rising sea levels throughout Polynesia.Pomee is the spokesmodel for Sea Level Rising, which aims to educate others on how pollution and the effects of global warming are devastating the islands her ancestors have called home for centuries.The biggest thing is working with the royal family, said Pomee.Theres an erosion of land, the water is being contaminated from the rising sea levels and its affecting families.Their survival is their crops.Its how they grow their food.So its important for me because these are things that my generation doesnt really care for or doesnt really understand how it can really affect us in the long term.Working with the royal family and the initiative its just opening my eyes up to what really needs to be done.Pomee said she is thankful for the chance to proudly embrace her figure for a magazine like Sports Illustrated.And shes hoping her photos will inspire other women to do the same.PLUS-SIZE MODEL HUNTER MCGRADY RETURNS TO SPORTS ILLUSTRATED SWIMSUIT I would say my confidence just comes from having a stronger sense of self, she explained.I feel like when you really know who you are and youre aware of your strengths and your weaknesses, that helps shape how you view yourself and how you compare yourself to the outside world.But once you really master that within, youre able to face anything.Just being aware of what makes you special and being able to amplify on those skills.""I think once people are able to identify what those things are, its a lot easier to really maneuver through the world and all of the hate that were going to go through," added Pome'e."I think its all about having a strong sense of self and knowing who you are.
‘When Harry Met Sally...’ director Rob Reiner reveals why the rom-com still resonates with fans:::::The classic rom-com When Harry Met Sally is turning 30 this summer and director Rob Reiner still cant believe the film has stood the test of time.The 1989 film explores how Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) have known each other for years, but fear sex would ruin their friendship.WHAT'S THE MOST ROMANTIC MOVIE SCENE OF ALL TIME?Two of its stars, writer Nora Ephron and actress Carrie Fisher, have since passed away, but the hit flick has lived on.In fact, it kicked off the 10th Annual TCM Classic Film Festival on Thursday in Hollywood.All I can never do is I look into myself and try to figure out, How do I think as a man?Reiner, 72, recently told The Associated Press on why he believes When Harry Met Sally still resonates with audiences.There are certain universal things that men experience and the fact that I was working with Nora Ephron, she brought the female perspective to the mix, and we made it a part of the creative process to say what actually happens between men and women, explained Reiner.You know, its not about [two cute people meeting] or putting some obstacles between the lovers so that they get together, but what actually happens with men and women.That was really the motivation for me.Reiner also shared he relied on real-life events for much-needed inspiration to bring the film to life.MICKEY ROONEY'S DAUGHTER TELLS ALL Because I was married for 10 years and had been single for 10 years and I was making a mess of my dating life, he said.I kept saying, How does this work?How do a man and woman get together?I started thinking about that and I talked to Nora and she liked the idea and we started working on it.I think people see some basic truths about men and women when they watch that movie.Despite the lasting success of When Harry Met Sally Reiner is aware that the romantic comedy genre isnt making as big of a splash in theaters these days.I dont know why, he explained.To me, the dance that happens between men and women is forever.That is the mating dance.Thats what we do.The studios are making a certain kind of film and basically, theyre big-event, franchise-type pictures with lots of CGI and action and all that stuff.And theyre not really focused on human dramas or romantic comedies or courtroom dramas.The only people who were making these kinds of things would be independent filmmakers and its very tough to make an honest film about what happens.Reiner said young, budding filmmakers have plenty of freedom to take on romantic comedy, but chances are the big studios will pass on them.GYPSY ROSE LEE'S SON TELLS ALL You cant get them made at studios, he said.They dont make those kinds of films.The only comedy, sort of romantic, theyre R-rated.They dont make just relationship movies.Reiner also noted that the idea of When Harry Met Sally turning 30 makes me feel old, but hes eager to revisit a magical moment from his career.Its really cool, he said.You make a film and you dont know if its going to stand the test of time or people are going to still like it.Whenever youve done something that people still enjoy its a pretty cool thing.

FBI's 'art cops': In hot pursuit of Renoirs, Rembrandts and ruby slippers:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - When a 17th century Dutch painting looted by the Nazis turned up for sale in New York in late 2017, the FBIs Art Crime Team moved in, verified its identity and helped win a court order to return the work to its rightful owners.FILE PHOTO: A pair of ruby slippers featured in the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota in 2005, is shown after it was recovered in a sting operation conducted in Minneapolis earlier this summer in this FBI Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., image released on September 4, 2018.Courtesy FBI/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo It was the latest of many high-profile cases for the 22-person Federal Bureau of Investigation division dedicated to solving a wide array of art-related crimes at an agency that is better known for chasing bank robbers, spies and other criminal rogues.Solomon Konincks 17th-century painting A Scholar Sharpening His Quill, was one of many treasures belonging to the family of art collector Adolphe Schloss that were seized by the Nazi-supporting Vichy government in France 75 years ago.The portrait, which once adorned Adolph Hitlers Munich offices, disappeared at the end of World War Two.It resurfaced at Christies auction house, which tipped off the FBI unit last year that a Chilean art dealer was trying to sell it.The evidence was really overwhelming, FBI Special Agent Chris McKeogh said, days after the works formal repatriation to the Schloss heirs in early April.There was really no question that this was the painting in question.In its early days, recalled Robert Wittman, the Art Crime Teams founding chief, being art cops was not exactly a path to directorship.But after 14 years, the team is getting more respect from fellow agents after several headline-grabbing recoveries in the United States of art works and other cultural property, Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter said.People just think what were doing is cool, said Carpenter, who now runs the unit from the FBIs Washington headquarters.I think weve changed a lot of perceptions, even within the organization, he said.So now my phone rings off the hook weekly for folks wanting to be on the team.Since it was founded in 2005, the team has recovered nearly 15,000 objects worth nearly $800 million and secured more than 90 convictions.CHAGALL, RENOIR AND RUBY SLIPPERS Last year alone, its recoveries included a painting by Marc Chagall that had been taken from the Manhattan home of an elderly couple nearly 30 years earlier, a Nazi-looted work by artist Auguste Renoir and a pair of ruby slippers worth millions worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz.It is not the money, Carpenter stressed, but rather the intrinsic value of stolen art and cultural property - anything from baseball cards to a $5 million Stradivarius - that determines whether the FBI will pursue it.The red sequined shoes stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Minnesota 13 years ago were a prime example.People responded to that case, he said.They said this is really important; this is a piece of Americana.Agents selected for the team must understand why art and culture matter to humanity, Carpenter said.Agent McKeogh pinpointed his art awakening to a college backpacking trip in Paris.On an obligatory visit to the Mona Lisa at the Louvre, he happened to pass Pierre-Narcisse Guerins 18th-century oil painting The Return of Marcus Sextus.I found a painting that spoke to me and spent about a half-hour sitting in front it, said McKeogh, who is based in New York.And from there, I was really hooked.MOST VEXING UNSOLVED CASE The United States was lagging far behind European countries in art crime-fighting resources when Wittman helped launch the team in 2005, partly to track down antiquities that were looted from the Baghdad Museum after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.Now a private consultant, Wittman was the bureaus original art sleuth.He said art thieves were always most vulnerable when they tried to unload their high-profile, ill-gotten gains.The real art in art heists is not the stealing, its the selling, said Wittman, who had recovered more than $300 million in stolen art when he retired in 2008 after 20 years.While there are no reliable statistics on art crime, Carpenter said he thinks technology is making things worse because stolen works and forgeries can be sold anonymously on online marketplaces.If the Art Crime Teams most vexing case is a daring 1990 heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in which thieves made off with 13 pieces by Dutch masters Rembrandt and Vermeer and other artists worth half a billion dollars.Despite a $10 million reward, none of them has been recovered, and the theft, considered to be among the biggest in art history, looms as the teams most glaring unsolved case.Theres not a single person on the Art Crime Team that doesnt dream of the day that we can recover those pieces, said Carpenter.
Florence study proves artist Leonardo da Vinci was ambidextrous:::::FLORENCE, Italy (Reuters) - An in-depth study of Leonardo da Vincis earliest-known drawing has proved that the great Renaissance artist was ambidextrous, Italys Uffizi Gallery said on Monday.The scientific and technological analysis also revealed a hidden, previously unknown landscape sketch, also by Leonardo, on the back of the original work.It is a real revolution in the field of Leonardo studies, said Uffizi director, Eike Schmidt.The findings were announced a month ahead of the 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo, with museums around Europe organizing exhibitions and events to celebrate the life of the man responsible for such masterpieces as Mona Lisa.His first-known drawing is dated Aug. 5, 1473 when Leonardo was 21 and shows a landscape of the Arno river valley and Montelupo Castle, just outside Florence.Commonly known as Landscape 8P from its inventory number, the work has words on the front going from right to left, as Leonardo often used to write, which gives the date.On the back, the brief script goes from left to right, and alludes to an informal contract.A study of the two texts confirmed they were both written by Leonardo and showed he was able to write perfectly using both his left and right hand.Leonardo was born left-handed, but was taught to write with his right hand from a very young age, said art historian Cecilia Frosinini.By looking at his writings, including from this drawing, one can see his right-handed calligraphy is educated and well done.Slideshow (11 Images) Using infrared light, the art experts also discovered two different layers of drawing, both on the back and front, with an ink line covering the original charcoal trace in certain places.Not much ink is visible on the back, but the infrared revealed that another landscape depicting a river crossed by a bridge was originally drawn there using a type of charcoal.It was not clear if the artist had rubbed the paper clean or if the charcoal had simply faded over time.The elements that emerged during this research open up new perspectives on the interpretation of Leonardos Landscape 8P and on how the artist (built) the landscape, on his technique and even on his habits and abilities in writing, Schmidt said.
Finely painted Ptolemaic tomb unveiled in Egypt:::::SOHAG, Egypt (Reuters) - Archaeologists on Friday unveiled a well preserved and finely painted tomb thought to be from the early Ptolemaic period near the Egyptian town of Sohag.Two mummies, of a woman and child, are on display at the newly discovered burial site, the Tomb of Tutu, at al-Dayabat, Sohag, Egypt April 5, 2019.REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany The tomb was built for a man named Tutu and his wife, and is one of seven discovered in the area last October, when authorities found smugglers digging illegally for artefacts, officials said.Its painted walls depict funeral processions and images of the owner working in the fields, as well as his family genealogy written in hieroglyphics.Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypts Supreme Council of Antiquities, described the burial chamber as a beautiful, colorful tomb.The tomb is made up of a central lobby, and a burial room with two stone coffins.The lobby is divided in two, he said.It shows images of the owner of the burial room, Tutu, giving and receiving gifts before different gods and goddesses.We see the same thing for his wife, Ta-Shirit-Iziz, with the difference that (we see) verses from a book, the book of the afterlife, he added.Two mummies, a woman aged between 35-50 and a boy aged 12-14, were on display outside the shallow burial chamber, in a desert area near the Nile about 390 km (242 miles) south of Cairo.Around 50 mummified animals, including mice and falcons, were also recovered from the tomb.Ptolemaic rule spanned about three centuries until the Roman conquest in 30 B.C.Egypts ancient sites are a draw for tourists and authorities hope new finds can help boost the sector, which has been recovering after foreigners were scared off by the North African countrys 2011 popular uprising and the turmoil and insecurity that followed.
Germany's new Bauhaus museum set for interactive opening:::::BERLIN (Reuters) - The new Bauhaus museum opens its doors to the public for the first time in the east German city of Weimar on Saturday after three years of construction, giving admirers of the world-famous form follows function aesthetic a new place of pilgrimage.An inauguration weekend, with free entry and various concerts and spectacles, will mark the peak of a year during which hundreds of events across Germany are commemorating the 100th birthday of the Bauhaus movement, associated with clean and functional design.Bauhaus has influenced design all over the world, said Ulrike Bestgen, the museums director, adding that Bauhaus pioneers dealt with urgent issues of their times, like housing shortages which are still relevant today.Three light and sound installations are set to interact with the new building, which, designed in white and gray by Berlin architect and long-time Bauhaus teacher Heike Hanada, itself recalls the minimalist sobriety of the original style.The school began in 1919 in the aftermath of World War One.Bauhaus - German for building house - pioneered a new restraint as a reaction against the decorative frills of the pre-war era that now seemed frivolous.The art school later moved from Weimar to Dessau, also in the east, where - once Hitlers Nazis moved into the local townhall - the Bauhaus was shut down.That was in 1933, the year in which Hitler came to power, bringing an end to the Weimar Republic, a short period of democracy between two World Wars in Germany which also started in 1919 and, like Weimars Bauhaus school, ended 14 years later.
Hemingway center opens in Cuba to preserve writer's work:::::SAN FRANCISCO DE PAULA, Cuba (Reuters) - A restoration center to preserve the work of Ernest Hemingway opened in Cuba on Saturday, highlighting an area of cooperation with the United States even as bilateral ties between the old Cold War foes have chilled again.A view of the Ernest Hemingway Museum during a visit of U.S.Congressman James Mcgovern (not pictured) in Havana, Cuba, March 30, 2019.REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Hemingway, who won the Nobel prize for Literature in 1954, wrote some of his greatest books during the 21 years he lived at Finca Vigia, or Lookout Farm, now a museum in San Francisco de Paula on the outskirts of Havana.The restoration center built by the Cuban National Cultural Heritage Council and Finca Vigia Foundation of the United States is located on the 15-acre (6-hectare) property where Hemingway lived in a tree-shaded, airy Spanish-style home.When we come together, when we work together, we can do positive and amazing things, Jim McGovern, a U.S. congressman for Massachusetts who wants better U.S.-Cuban relations, said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony.McGovern said the project would have been much easier were it not for the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, that President Donald Trump has tightened since coming to power.Hemingway moved to Finca Vigia in 1939, the year before For Whom the Bell Tolls was published, and wrote The Old Man and the Sea, A Moveable Feast and Islands in the Stream while he was there, according to local scholars.He left Cuba in 1960, more than a year after the Cuban revolution and less than a year before he killed himself in Idaho at age 61 amid a struggle with depression.The writer left thousands of documents in Cuba, ranging from manuscripts of some of his works to letters, as well as photographs and annotated books.The restoration center, which received financing from the Ford Foundation, American Express Philanthropy and the AT&T Foundation amongst others, includes laboratories and an air-conditioned vault.The Cuban National Cultural Heritage Council and Finca Vigia Foundation had previously signed three cooperation agreements to conserve and disseminate the legacy of Hemingway.
Italy's Pompeii offers new glimpses of life before calamity:::::POMPEII, Italy (Reuters) - Nearly 2,000 years after Pompeii was destroyed by a volcanic eruption, the ancient Roman city is still giving up its long-buried secrets.Fantastic frescos, preserved mosaics and obscene graffiti are just some of the discoveries emerging from the largest archaeological dig at the site since the 1950s.As teams of construction workers shore up mounds of earth pressing down on the excavated areas to prevent them crushing the ruins, archaeologists and conservationists are busy restoring newly discovered art and bolstering fragile walls.The burst of activity marks the final stages of the Great Pompeii Project, launched in 2012 after a spate of cave-ins, with the European Union and Italian state handing over 105 million euros ($118 million) to halt the decay.The risk of collapse, of serious damage is past.Now Pompeii is quite safe, said Francesco Muscolino, 42, an archaeologist working on the program.The extensive conservation work has enabled scholars to uncover a few more areas of Pompeii still buried under volcanic debris, including two large houses, alleyways, highly decorated interiors and a brightly colored snack bar.Pompeii was submerged by volcanic ash when Mount Vesuvius exploded in AD 79, killing thousands of Romans who had no idea they were living beneath one of Europes biggest volcanoes.Memory of the catastrophe faded over time and it was not until 1748 that any meaningful exploration was undertaken.More systematic excavations were launched the following century, but by the end of the 20th century, neglect, lack of funds and repeated flooding were taking a heavy toll.In 2010, less than 15 percent of the excavated area was accessible to tourists, wild dogs roamed the paved streets, and only 10 buildings were open, against 64 in 1956.Today, around 70 percent of the uncovered city is accessible and more than 30 fully restored buildings can be visited.A view of the ancient archaeological site of Pompeii, Italy March 27, 2019.REUTERS/Ciro De Luca CHARCOAL INSCRIPTION The improved access has helped lift tourist numbers, with some 3.5 million people coming to Pompeii last year, an increase of one million in just a decade.Even more visitors are expected as the latest finds are gradually unveiled to the public.Among the highlights are a fresco of the Greek mythological figure Narcissus leaning languidly on a block of stone and staring down at his own reflection in a pool of water.In the same house, archaeologists found a small, exquisite wall painting portraying the seduction of the Spartan queen Leda by the Greek God Zeus, disguised as a swan.It was wonderful because it is very beautiful and in very good condition, said Stefania Giudice, one of the conservationists tasked with preserving the new discoveries.The frescos bright colors have already faded since the ash and pumice were painstakingly removed last year as moisture on the surface of the wall dried out, dulling the rich tones.We will clean it and protect it and get the beautiful colors back, Giudice said, predicting that the fresco-rich house, still partially buried, would be opened to the public within one or two years as new tourist routes were laid out.Elsewhere, some graffiti contains graphic sexual references.Perhaps one of the most significant finds was the least spectacular at first sight - a brief charcoal inscription which cites the date Oct. 17 written in the hallway of a grand house where at least six bodies were also discovered.Archaeologists believe the faint note might have been written just before the eruption, meaning the disaster probably struck two months later than previously thought.Muscolino predicted it would take many years for scholars to assimilate and interpret all the material recovered in recent months, with trays of delicate glass, fresco fragments, plaster moldings, coins and amphora stored away for future research.More than 270 years after the first serious excavations began, a third of the city, which covers roughly 165 acres (66.77 hectares), remains buried and unexplored.Slideshow (7 Images) But there are no plans for further, major digs after this latest project ends, with the emphasis now on conservation.Excavations are like having children.You have to take care of them.You cant just abandon what you find and move on to the next thing, said Giudice.It is a real responsibility.($1 = 0.8909 euros)
Botticelli painting revealed under century of varnish:::::LONDON (Reuters) - British art restorers working on a painting long thought to be a later imitation of a Sandro Botticelli masterpiece have found it in fact came from the Italian renaissance artists own workshop.English Heritage said on Thursday its conservators made the discovery while removing layers of aging varnish from the Madonna della Melagrana (Madonna of the Pomegranate), which shows the mother of Christ holding both her child and the fruit.I noticed instantly that the painting bore a striking resemblance to the workshop of Botticelli himself.Stylistically, it was too similar to be an imitation, it was of the right period, it was technically correct and it was painted on poplar, a material commonly used at the time, said English Heritage senior conservator Rachel Turnbull.To see these colors come out under these layers of later restoration, it was just a wonderful experience, she told BBC radio.The experts used X-ray and infra-red examination to reveal drawing underneath, including changes to the original lines, which provided clues to its real identity.It is the closest version of the 15th century painters original masterpiece, which sits in Florences Uffizi gallery.Famous for paintings like The Birth of Venus and Primavera, Botticelli commonly made copies of his own work to sell to those who liked a painting they had seen elsewhere.Part of the collection amassed by 19th century diamond magnate Julius Wernher, the restored painting will go on display at Londons Rangers House gallery on April 1.
Surrealist artist Man Ray's tomb vandalized in Paris:::::A view shows the desecrated tomb of American-born surrealist artist Man Ray and his wife in the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, France, March 28, 2019.REUTERS/Charles Platiau PARIS (Reuters) - A man has been arrested after the tomb of American-born surrealist artist Man Ray was desecrated in Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, a city official said on Thursday.Born into a family of Russian Jewish immigrants in 1890, Man Ray spent much of his career in the French capital and was close to dada and surrealist artists such as Salvador Dali and Marcel Duchamp in the 1920s and 1930s.The mans motives were unclear, a spokeswoman for Paris City Hall said, adding that early investigations indicated he was homeless and drunk when police arrested him on Tuesday as he was damaging another nearby tomb.A headstone added to the tomb after Man Rays wife died was also knocked down.Man Ray is best known for Ingress Violin, a nude print in which he transformed the naked back of his muse, singer Kiki de Montparnasse, into a violin.Man Ray, who was named Emmanuel Radnitzky at birth, fled to the United States from France during World War Two.He returned to Paris in the early 1950s where he lived until his death in 1976.France has seen a spate of vandalism at Jewish cemeteries and memorials amid concern about rising anti-Semitism in France, home to the largest Jewish community in Europe, although there was no indication that this incident was linked to anti-Semitism.Montparnasse Cemetery contains the graves of other well known people, including philosopher and playwright Jean-Paul Sartre, and writers Simone de Beauvoir and Charles Baudelaire.
Qatar's 'desert rose' museum opens at last:::::DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar on Thursday will open the doors to one of its most lavish cultural projects yet, a sweeping national museum designed by French architect Jean Nouvel that lays out the tiny Gulf states origin story and gas-powered rise to riches.Desert oryxes are seen on display at Qatar National Museum, in Doha, Qatar March 27, 2019.REUTERS/Ibraheem al Omari The museum is the latest move in Dohas campaign for regional dominance in arts and culture that has seen big-ticket acquisitions, new galleries, film festivals and international exhibitions by artists like Damien Hirst and Richard Serra.Qatari officials declined to disclose the cost of building the museum, which includes 52,000 square meters of winding floor space, an artificial lagoon, and the restored palace of Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani, who ruled until 1949.Set along the Doha seaside and over a decade in the making, the museums exterior is a tangle of massive interlocking discs that evoke the shape of a desert rose, a design Nouvel said was a big technical challenge.It creates a variation of space and unexpected spaces and unexpected proportions.I think the visitor will be surprised, Nouvel said at an event on Wednesday to mark the opening.The interior features walls splashed with looping videos on Qatars desert life and pearl diving in past eras, plus digital archives about life under Ottoman and British rule.Its unveiling comes amid a protracted diplomatic and political boycott launched in mid-2017 by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt.The bloc accuses Qatar of supporting terrorism, a charge Doha denies.The blockade has not affected us one bit, Qatar museums chairperson Sheikha Al Mayassa Al Thani said.All people are welcome to this museum and we remain open to the rest of the world and we remain open to dialogue.Nouvel designed rival United Arab Emirates Louvre Abu Dhabi, which opened in 2017 with more than 600 art works from around the world as part of that countrys own efforts to burnish its regional culture credentials.Sheikha Mayassa, sister of the ruling emir, is considered one of the worlds most important art buyers after making a string of high-price acquisitions in the years before Qatar was hit by an energy price slump in 2014.
Etruscan tomb in Corsica may yield secrets on civilization's decline:::::An archaeologist works in an Etruscan tomb containing a skeleton and dozens of objects in Aleria, in the east of the French Mediterranean island of Corsica, in this picture provided by INRAP (Institut National de Recherches Archeologique Preventives) on March 27, 2019.Denis Gliksman/Inrap/HANDOUT via Reuters ALERIA, Corsica (Reuters) - French archaeologists have unearthed an Etruscan tomb containing a skeleton and dozens of artefacts in Corsica, a rare discovery that could shed new light on the wealthy civilization of northern Italy and its assimilation into the Roman Empire.The archaeologists found the vault, chiselled into the rock and dating back to the fourth century B.C., within a large Roman necropolis containing thousands of tombs in Aleria, in the east of the French Mediterranean island.The Etruscans originated in Tuscany during the Bronze Age in around 900 B.C.and left little written trace of their culture.Their decline was gradual and the last Etruscan cities were absorbed by Rome around 100 B.C.The discovery, announced this week, could yield new details on the existence of a stable Etruscan population in Corsica and help archaeologists understand the slow demise of the Etruscan civilization.Its the missing link which will allow us to piece together Etruscan funerary rites, but it also reinforces the hypothesis that before the Roman conquest (in -259 B.C), Aleria was a transit point in the Tyrrhenian Sea, blending Etruscan, Carthaginian and Phocaean interests, head curator Franck Leandri said.The grave appears to belong to a high-ranking official, holding about 15 ceramic vases similar to Etruscan pieces and what appears to be a mirror or the lid of a casing, anthropologist Catherine Rigeade said at the site.We have some knowledge of Etruscan objects, but we know very little about Etruscan subjects; here we have both, Rigeade added.Close to the tomb, archaeologists discovered a gold signet ring bearing almost no trace of time.On it, a feminine face, possibly depicting the goddess Aphrodite, can be made out.The researchers will now focus on accessing the skeleton, which is covered with collapsed furniture apart from its skull.They plan to call in forensic scientists to help reveal the secrets of the remains.
Dutch art sleuth says he has recovered stolen Picasso:::::AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A prominent Dutch art detective says he has helped recover a painting by Pablo Picasso that was stolen from a private Saudi owners yacht in France in 1999.In an interview with broadcaster RTL, Arthur Brand said he was passed in confidence the 1938 Buste de Femme, which portrays Picassos fellow artist and lover Dora Maar.You fear that it will be fake, but when I had it in my hands, I knew right away: this is real, he said.Having received the painting in black trash bags at his house, Brand said he contacted police and handed it to an insurance company for possible return to its owner.I had it hanging in my house for one night, he said, estimating its value at 25 million euros ($28 million) .That was exciting ... Its fantastic, so unbelievably beautiful.Brand said he had first heard the painting was in the Netherlands in 2015.He told the broadcaster he believes it may have been traded back and forth 20 times in the Amsterdam underworld, used as collateral in drugs and weapons deals.He said the final owner was a real estate agent who wanted to be rid of it after he realized it was stolen.Brand said two men contacted him and arranged the drop-off at his house.Dutch police told local media they were not taking further action, as the painting has been returned and the statute of limitations in the 1999 theft has expired.The owner, identified as Saudi businessman Abdulmohsen Abdulmalik Al al-Sheikh, could not immediately be reached for comment.
India to auction fugitive billionaire's art collection:::::MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian tax authorities are hoping for a windfall with the auction on Tuesday of rare oil paintings that were once part of fugitive billionaire jeweler Nirav Modis collection and have been seized by the government.A journalist takes photos of artworks once part of billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi's collection ahead of their auction at a gallery in Mumbai, India, March 25, 2019.REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui Auctioneers say the sale is the first of its kind in a country where tax authorities have usually auctioned property, gold and luxury items, but not art.After a court order allowing the auction to take place, tax authorities, who are pursuing Modi over the countrys largest bank fraud, appointed professional auction house Saffronart.The sale in Mumbai of some 68 works is expected to fetch anywhere between 300 million and 500 million rupees ($4.4 million-$7.3 million).Until a few years ago, the tax authorities really didnt know the value of art, said Farah Siddiqui, an art adviser who is advising clients eyeing Modis collection.The 48-year-old Modi, whose diamonds have sparkled on Hollywood stars, is one of the prime accused in a $2 billion loan fraud at state-run Punjab National Bank.Modi denies the charges and believes they are politically motivated.The auction comes just weeks before a national election and as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces pressure to bring back Nirav Modi (no relation), who fled the country last year and has been residing in the United Kingdom.He was arrested last week by British authorities and remanded in custody after he appeared before a London court.India asked Britain last August to extradite Modi.The auction includes works by Raja Ravi Varma, a 19th century painter considered among Indias finest, and V.S.Gaitonde, a modern artist known for his abstract and often monochromatic paintings.We believe that the collections intrinsic value will garner a positive response from collectors, said Saffronart Chief Executive Dinesh Vazirani.India Law Alliance, a law firm representing the company controlled by Modi that owns the artwork, said it was challenging the court order that allowed the auction.The case will be heard by the Bombay High Court on Wednesday, a lawyer at the firm told Reuters.Vijay Aggarwal, a lawyer for Modi, declined to comment.($1 = 68.8990 Indian rupees)
Cavalli's creative director Paul Surridge quits:::::FILE PHOTO: British creative director Paul Surridge acknowledges the applause at the end of Roberto Cavalli Spring/Summer 2018 show at the Milan Fashion Week in Milan, Italy, September 22, 2017.REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo ROME (Reuters) - Paul Surridge said on Monday he would resign from his position as creative director of Italian fashion house Roberto Cavalli, confirming press rumors about his imminent exit.The designer, who joined the Florentine label in 2017, said in an Instagram post he wished to focus on other projects that I put aside in order to achieve our common goals with Roberto Cavalli Group.The company, founded by Roberto Cavalli in the early 1970s and famous for its animal prints, was taken over by Italian private equity firm Clessidra in 2015 in a bid to turn it around.Clessidra in October hired Rothschild to find a minority partner for the fashion group, sources have said.Since then the private equity group, which owns 90 percent of Cavalli, has also decided to consider offers for a majority stake in the fashion label, other sources have said, as the sale process has proven more difficult than previously envisaged.Under new Chief Executive Gian Giacomo Ferraris, hired in 2016 to help boost the label, the company has been working to expand into lifestyle categories to find new sources of revenue.Ferraris said in October Cavalli was on track to return to a net profit in 2019.
Immigrant portraits in New York art show face down Trump:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Immigrant faces captured in life-sized portraits by artist Betsy Ashton look the viewer straight in the eye, as if eager to tell their stories of leaving home to brave new struggles in a strange land.Visitors examine Artist Betsy Ashton's exhibition, "Portraits of Immigrants: Unknown Faces, Untold Stories" at Riverside Church in New York, U.S., March 10, 2019.REUTERS/Demetrius Freeman Ashton said she created the oil paintings to counter what she calls a false political narrative spun by the Trump administration.I simply decided it was time to balance the story, time to try to counter this inflammatory rage thats being whipped up against a group of people that dont deserve it, Ashton said.Her Portraits of Immigrants are on display through Easter at Manhattans Riverside Church, about 10 miles up the Hudson River from Ellis Island, where 12 million newcomers landed from 1892 to 1954.The Statue of Liberty towers over the island, asking the world in a plaque to Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.The portraits include teachers, entrepreneurs, a nurse, housekeeper, actor, politician and barista from Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe.They are newcomers and long-timers.Some are U.S. citizens, others have proper documents, one does not.STRUGGLING TO FIT IN TO A NEW CULTURE Their stories, which Ashton, a former CBS News correspondent, wrote and posted next to each portrait, tell of struggling to fit in to a new culture and learning a new language for the promise of a better life.The collective portrayal of the immigrant experience is whats compelling, not just one individual story, said Ron Kim, who came to New York from South Korea when he was 6.He is pictured in his New York State Assembly office, where he represents part of Queens, one of the citys five boroughs.Another immigrant immortalized in oil paint is Abdul Saboor, who taught U.S. troops the culture of his native Afghanistan before coming to the United States nearly five years ago.For Saboor, now a U.S. citizen working for the upstate New York nonprofit that helped resettle him, Ashtons exhibit is an opportunity for Americans to imagine themselves in my skin.Both Kim and Saboor said they are keenly aware of - and disturbed by - the political hot potato that immigration has become since Donald Trump became president.As a candidate in 2016, Trump stirred anti-immigrant fervor by accusing Mexico of sending drug dealers, gangs and rapists into the country, as his supporters loudly urged him to build that wall along the southern U.S. border.As president, Trump has not only maintained a rhetorical drum beat against illegal immigrants, but also sought to narrow the pathways for legal immigration and travel.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story.SERMON ABOUT THE GOOD SAMARITAN Ashton says hearing Trump during the campaign shortly after a Sunday sermon about the Good Samaritan inspired her to put brush to canvas to show the true stories of American newcomers.In her neighborhood in Queens, where nearly half the population is foreign born, the English-Scottish-Welsh-German artist whose ancestors on her fathers side arrived in the country about 300 years ago, had no trouble finding immigrants.She started with Eddie Rigo, who runs the espresso bar she visits each morning.He fled crime-ridden Sao Paulo where his Italian family had been in the pizza business.Then came Beata Szakowicz Kombel, a nurse Ashton knows from doctor visits.She left Polands sagging economy in the early 1990s.The collection grew to 16, and Ashton is seeking two more immigrants from troubled countries, preferably Venezuela and Syria, to complete the set.Winning over her subjects often took salesmanship.I didnt want to be in the spotlight, said Porez Luxama, who left Haiti in the 1990s and teaches math in a New York City middle school.But she was very convincing.Ashton, whose works include a portrait on display in the U.S. embassy in London, has spent two years on the project, which cost her more than $200,000 in lost income.She is seeking other venues for her exhibit after it leaves Riverside Church.The subjects include Angel (not her real name), who came over on a tourist visa 20 years ago; Maria Solome, a Guatemalan housekeeper who sneaked across the Rio Grande but recently secured a green card; and John Lam who came from Hong Kong poor and now heads the Lam Group real estate investment conglomerate.Slideshow (9 Images) Despite their assorted origins, races and religions, Ashton said immigrants share a determination to overcome the problems that drove them from their homes.Its the grit, the guts and the resilience that comes with survival, sacrifice and risk-taking, she said.Those are the same qualities that we celebrate in immigrants from generations past.(This story refiles to fix amount in paragraph 22 to $200,000)
Alibaba, Tencent, car makers set up $1.5 billion China ride-hailing venture:::::BEIJING (Reuters) - Alibaba, Tencent, Suning, and car makers including Chongqing Changan Automobile have set up a $1.5 billion Chinese ride-hailing venture, a move that could test the dominance of ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing.FILE PHOTO: A man stands near the logo of Alibaba Group at the company's newly-launched office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia June 18, 2018.REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin/File Photo Chongqing Changan Automobile said on Friday that it has invested 1.6 billion yuan ($238.36 million) in the Nanjing-based investment company alongside partners such as the investment units of Alibaba, Tencent and retailer Suning.Com Co Ltd, and automakers FAW and Dongfeng Motor.China is home to the worlds largest ride-hailing market, estimated by consulting firm Bain & Co to be worth $23 billion.Of that, Didi Chuxing takes 90 percent of all bookings.However, a swathe of car makers, from BMW, Geely to SAIC as well as other tech firms such as Meituan Dianping have also launched their own mobility services in a bid to grab a share of the fast growing market.Didi, which is backed by Japans SoftBank Group Corp and Uber Technologies, also has joint ventures with BAIC and Volkswagen.Wijaya Ng, who tracks Chinas automotive industry at Ipsos Business Consulting, said the new venture dovetails with a larger, global trend wherein traditional automakers are entering the ride-hailing sector.They see that moving forward, if car-hailing is going to be the future, they want to tap into this market sooner rather than later, said Ng.Changan said that itself, Dongfeng and FAW will each have a 15 percent stake in the joint venture, which will set up a ride-sharing company with a focus on new energy vehicles.Suning will be the biggest shareholder with a 19 percent stake while Alibaba and Tencents investment units will together hold the remainder shares with some other funds, it added.The new ride-hailing company and its investors, which come from a range of fields, will help form business synergies which will help enrich the companies ecosystems, Suning said in a statement.FAW and Dongfeng confirmed the venture while Alibaba and Tencent declined to comment beyond the Changan statement.Didi declined to comment.Shares of Changan and Dongfeng Automobile Co Ltd jumped by the maximum daily allowed 10 percent after the news.FAW Car Co Ltd shares climbed 6.6 percent.The growing popularity of ride-hailing services for commuting and running errands in congested cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is showing early signs of reducing private car ownership.However, the industry and Didi came under tighter government scrutiny and regulation last year after a Didi passenger was raped and murdered by her driver.
Fund managers skittish over Levi's long-term growth prospects:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Levi Strauss & Cos is betting it can convince investors there is still plenty of global growth left for the 165-year old company, but fund managers fret the iconic blue jeans makers stock may be too pricey to generate a decent return.FILE PHOTO: Levi Strauss & Co. CEO Chip Bergh rings a bell as CFO Harmit Singh looks on during the company's IPO on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 21, 2019.REUTERS/Lucas Jackson The San Francisco-based company returned to the public markets Thursday for the first time since it went private through a leveraged buyout in 1985 with a stock debut that sold $587 million worth of shares and gave it a market value of more than $8.7 billion .In its prospectus, Levis said it plans to expand its womens clothing line and grow in markets such as China, which represented just 3 percent of its net sales in 2018.Levis shares jumped more than 30 percent, which has mutual fund managers questioning whether a long-term investment in the denim company would be profitable.Its a mature company that already has broad distribution and its customer base is shrinking because department stores are shrinking, said Chris Terry, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management.Unlike companies like Under Armour Inc, whose shares are up nearly 22 percent year-to-date, Levis does not have a ton of room to expand the brand because it is already so well-known, Terry said.The newly-public company would also face increased competition for fund managers attention if VF Corp spins off Western jeans brand Wranglers, as expected in the first half of 2019.Wranglers also sells apparel, including cowboy hats, shirts, and jackets.With Wrangler, you get Western wear, which is probably a larger secular growth opportunity than denim alone and has only one other major competitor in Boot Barn Holdings Inc, Terry said.Year-to-date, shares of Boot Barn are up more than 56 percent.Robert Bacarella, portfolio manager of the Monetta Fund, said concerns over Levis expansion plans outweigh the attractiveness of its brand name at its current price.Were all sitting around here asking, Wheres the growth?he said.If they can come out with a plan to show that they can grow market share and not be as dependent on retail stores then it becomes a lot more interesting.With its long history, the company comes to the public markets at a time when the most anticipated initial public offerings are technology companies tied to the growth of the smartphone.The average age of companies that have debuted so far in 2019 is four years, according to Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital.Fellow Bay Area companies Lyft, Uber Technologies Inc, AirBnb Inc and Pinterest, which are all expected to go public this year, have all been founded in the last 11 years.Concerns about Levis growth rate would have been alleviated if its shares had remained near the $15 initial midpoint of the IPO pricing, or roughly seven and a half times its earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization, said Arun Daniel, a portfolio manager at J O Hambro Capital Management.They could see double-digit growth in the womens category by taking share from competitors like Guess, which would be interesting because then youre getting both the brand and growth and it becomes an attractive story for 3 to 5 years, Daniel said.But it all comes down to price.
China's pork imports to double in 2019 as swine fever hits local output: analyst:::::WUZHEN, China (Reuters) - Chinas 2019 pork imports are set to double from last year to 2 million tonnes, a Rabobank analyst said on Thursday, as African swine fever hits production of the meat in the worlds top hog market.FILE PHOTO: A resident gets pork from a vendor at a market in Beijing, China December 26, 2018.REUTERS/Jason Lee China has reported 113 outbreaks of the contagious disease since last August, though farmers and industry insiders say several outbreaks are going unreported.African swine fever, which does not harm humans, has a high mortality rate in pigs and has no vaccine or cure.Chinese pork production will fall by up to 20 percent in 2019, Oscar Tjakra, a director of food and agribusiness research at Rabobank, told a conference in the east of the country.China typically accounts for around half the worlds output of the meat.That means local production this year of between 50 million and 51 million tonnes, Tjakra told Reuters on the sidelines of the event, down from last years 54 million to 55 million tonnes.The United States agriculture departments attache in Beijing has forecast pork production at 51.4 million tonnes this year, down 5 percent from 2018, with imports seen at 2 million tonnes.Chinas pig herd declined by 15 percent in 2018, according to Rabobank estimates, Tjakra said.Pork production increased in the first three quarters of 2018, said Zhu Zengyong, associate professor at the Agricultural Information Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), but declined significantly in the fourth quarter after the disease began spreading rapidly.He cited official data issued by the statistics bureau, which shows the number of slaughtered hogs fell 1.2 percent in 2018 to 693.8 million heads.Pork output last year was 54 million tonnes, the bureau said.The disease has totally disrupted the production plans of many major companies, added Zhu, with some halting expansion because of the disease.Other speakers said the drop in output would hit feed demand hard.Chinas pig feed demand in the 2018-19 crop year that runs from October to September will fall 12 percent and soymeal demand in the same period will drop 5.5 percent, said Li Ning, general manager of commodity trader Living Water Trade (Shanghai) Co Ltd. Li Qiang, chief consultant at Shanghai JC Intelligence Co Ltd said he sees pig feed consumption down 25-30 percent in 2019, and overall feed demand down from 12 to 15 percent.

U.S. states probing Hyundai, Kia over vehicle fires: Connecticut AG:::::(Reuters) - A group of U.S. states is investigating Hyundai Motor Co and Kia Motors Corp for potential unfair and deceptive acts related to reports of hundreds of vehicle fires, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said on Monday.The Hyundai logo is seen outside a Hyundai car dealer in Golden, Colorado, November 3, 2014.REUTERS/Rick Wilking The South Korean automakers have recalled more than 2.3 million vehicles since 2015 to address various engine fire risks in a series of recalls.In November, Reuters reported that federal prosecutors had launched a criminal investigation into Hyundai and Kia to determine if vehicle recalls linked to engine defects had been conducted properly.We are aware of multiple fires involving Connecticut vehicles, including some allegedly already repaired through the recall process.This is a serious matter, and we are moving aggressively and responsibly to uncover the facts and to ensure accountability, Tong said in a statement.Hyundai and Kia said they were cooperating with the investigation.Hyundai added that it had improved its engine manufacturing and was reaching out to affected customers.A spokeswoman for the Connecticut attorney general declined to say how many states were taking part.Reuters reported in January that the companies would offer software upgrades for 3.7 million vehicles not being recalled.A South Korean whistleblower in 2016 reported concerns to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has been probing the timeliness of three U.S. recalls and whether they covered enough vehicles.In 2015, Hyundai recalled 470,000 U.S. Sonata sedans, saying engine failure would result in a vehicle stall, increasing the risk of a crash.At the time, Kia did not recall its vehicles, which share the same Theta II engines.In March 2017, Hyundai expanded its original U.S. recall to 572,000 Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles with those Theta II engines, citing the same issue involving manufacturing debris.On the same day, Kia also recalled 618,000 Optima, Sorento and Sportage vehicles, all of which use the same engine.Last month, the Center for Auto Safety, which has petitioned NHTSA to demand the recall of additional vehicles, told Congress that Kia and Hyundai must recall more vehicles at risk of fires after reports of 300 fires not the result of a collision.On Monday, Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, asked NHTSA to launch a safety defect investigation into Hyundai and Kia vehicles with the Theta II engines and order an immediate recall of vehicles.

Obama, Stevie Wonder, Snoop Dogg pay tribute to rapper Nipsey Hussle:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Barack Obama sent a letter, Stevie Wonder sang, and Snoop Dogg called slain rapper Nipsey Hussle a peace advocate at a Los Angeles memorial on Thursday attended by family members, friends and thousands of fans.Obama wrote a letter to the family that was read by Karen Civil, Hussles friend and business partner.The former president praised Hussles attempts to revitalize the gang-plagued neighborhood where he was raised, and where he was gunned down last month.While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets and despair, Nipsey saw potential.He saw hope, Obamas letter said, referencing his efforts to build a skills-training center and a co-working space.The 21,000-capacity Staples Center, a sports and pop concert venue, was packed with fans wearing white and blue for the three-hour memorial.It was followed by a 25-mile (40-km) procession through the streets of south Los Angeles.Fellow California rapper Snoop Dogg recalled Hussles former connections with the notorious Crips gang that the musician later parlayed into efforts to combat gang violence.Hussle, 33, was shot on March 31 outside a clothing store he owned in south Los Angeles.Last week, a stampede erupted at a local vigil for Hussle after reports of a gunman in the crowd.For God so loved the world, that he gave us a good Crip, the late great neighborhood Nip.Rest in peace, Snoop Dogg said.He called the Grammy-nominated singer a peace advocate because of his work with all members of the community.Wonder played his 1980 hit Rocket Love and a version of Eric Claptons Tears in Heaven.Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan said Hussle has become to hip hop and rap what Bob Marley was to reggae.He lived the gang life but he didnt stay there.He lived the life of the hood but he rose above the pull of gravity, Farrakhan said in a speech.Slideshow (19 Images) Hussles two year-old son, dressed in a blue suit, was brought on stage in the arms of the musicians girlfriend, model Lauren London.A 29-year-old man last week pleaded not guilty to murder charges.Police said Hussles shooting was motivated by a personal dispute, although it took place in a surge of gang-related violence in south Los Angeles in March.Hussle, whose real name was Ermias Asghedom, was Grammy-nominated earlier this year for his debut studio album Victory Lap.

(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co priced its highly anticipated streaming video service below Netflix in an aggressive move to challenge the dominant streaming service and entice families to buy yet another monthly subscription.Disney said on Thursday its new family-friendly streaming service will cost $7 monthly or $70 annually with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the worlds most popular entertainment franchises in a bid to challenge the digital dominance of Netflix.The ad-free monthly subscription called Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12 and in every major global market over time, the company said.In addition to Disney films and TV shows, it will feature programming from the Marvel superhero universe, the Star Wars galaxy, Toy Story creator Pixar animation the National Geographic channel and the entire library of The Simpsons.What we are putting forward is an aggressive strategy, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts at the presentation.Weve got to be very serious and all in on it.The company set a target of luring between 60 million to 90 million subscribers and achieving profitability in fiscal year 2024.It plans to plow a little over $1 billion in cash to finance original programming in fiscal 2020 and about $2 billion by 2024.The cost of the service was lower than the $7.50 per month that Wall Street analysts expected on average, according to a Reuters poll, and could likely be seen as a stronger bid to appeal to more customers.Patrice Cucinello, a director at Fitch Ratings, said Disney had priced the new service very affordably.Disney is approaching streaming offerings, particularly Disney+, with guns blazing, looking to take share and quickly ramp subscriber growth, Cucinello said.To get it in front of more people, Disney said it has struck deals with Roku Inc and Sony Corp to distribute Disney+ on streaming devices and console gaming systems and expects it to be widely available on smart televisions, tablets, and other outlets by launch.It did not mention if it would be available on Apple Incs upcoming video service.Disney kicked off its presentation to Wall Street analysts at its Burbank, California, headquarters on Thursday with a video that demonstrated the breadth of its portfolio, showing clips from dozens of classic TV shows and movies from Frozen and The Lion King to Avatar and The Sound of Music.FILE PHOTO: Disney characters Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse attend the 25th anniversary of Disneyland Paris at the park in Marne-la-Vallee, near Paris, France, April 12, 2017.REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo The transformation of the Mouse House, as it is known, from a cable television powerhouse into a leader of streaming media could be Igers final legacy as he told Wall Street analysts he would not extend his contract beyond 2021 and was working with the board of directors on a succession plan.GLOBAL GROWTH Executives said they see opportunities to take its ESPN+ sport streaming video service to Latin America and are looking into international expansion of its Hulu streaming video business, which offers movies and shows targeted to adults.Disney also forecast Hulus subscribers to reach 40 million to 60 million by fiscal 2024 and reach profitability in the United States by either 2023 or 2024.Hulu currently has 25 million subscribers and is expected to lose $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.The digital push is Disneys response to cord-cutting, the dropping of cable service that has hit its ESPN sports network and other channels, and the rise of Netflix Inc.The Silicon Valley upstart has amassed 139 million customers worldwide since it began streaming 12 years ago.Disney will join the market at a time when audiences are facing a host of choices, and monthly bills, for digital entertainment.Apple, AT&T Incs WarnerMedia and others plan new streaming services.Slideshow (3 Images) To bolster its potential digital portfolio, Disney recently purchased film and TV assets from Rupert Murdochs 21st Century Fox and gained prized properties such as Avatar.Disney had been supplying new movies such as Black Panther and Beauty and the Beast to Netflix after their runs in theaters but ended that arrangement this year to feed its own streaming ambitions.The company estimated it is foregoing $150 million in licensing revenue this fiscal year by saving programming for its own platforms.The Disney+ programming will draw in part from Disneys deep library of classic family films.It also will include exclusive original content such as a live-action Star Wars series called The Mandalorian, a show focused on Marvel movie villain Loki, and animated Monsters at Work, inspired by hit Pixar movie Monsters Inc.Some new Disney movies, such as a Lady and the Tramp remake, will go directly to the Disney+ app.Other new releases will appear on Disney+ after their run in theaters and after they cycle out of the home video sales window, executives have said.
U.S. Senator Warner eyes social media bills for hate speech, data portability:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.Senator Mark Warner, who co-sponsored legislation this week to ban deceptive practices by social media companies, said on Thursday he was eyeing additional bills aimed at limiting hate speech and allowing users to move their data across platforms.FILE PHOTO: Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) talks with military families about their hazardous living conditions during a meeting at the Peninsula Workforce Development Office in Newport News, Virginia, U.S. March 11, 2019.REUTERS/Ryan M. Kelly The Democratic lawmaker said he would offer more bills in the next month or two, ideally with Republican colleagues as a co-sponsor.The additional legislation could focus on hate speech, data portability, which gives social media users the ability to easily take their data to another site, and transparency about who or what is on the other side of an internet conversation, Warner said in an interview with Reuters.On Tuesday, Warner joined with Republican Senator Deb Fischer to introduce a bill to bar online platforms like Facebook Inc or Alphabet Incs Google from misleading people into giving personal data to companies, or otherwise tricking them.It would also ban online platforms with more than 100 million monthly active users from designing addicting games or other websites for children under age 13.Warner is eager to increase transparency on social media platforms.Shouldnt we have the right to know whether were being contacted by a human being versus a bot when youre on social media?he said.Issues of engagement and data collection are key for social media companies since they use information gathered about users to sell advertisements, a key source of profit.Warner noted the real-life implications of hate speech on social media, pointing to mass killings in New Zealand and Pittsburgh.In a massacre in New Zealand, a gunman opened fire in two mosques on March 15, killing 50 people as he broadcast the attack live on Facebook.Last year, 11 people were shot to death in a Pittsburgh synagogue.The man accused in the killings had made aggressive anti-Semitic comments in online forums.Some of the proposed legislation could be rolled into a federal privacy bill being drafted in Congress.That bill was prompted by Californias data privacy law that imposes fines of up to $7,500 on large companies for intentional failure to disclose data collection or delete user data on request, or for selling others data without permission.It takes effect next year.I want technology to stay.I want the social media platforms to stay, Warner said.But I do think the days of the Wild Wild West where anything goes, people just arent going to allow it.

Disney sees ESPN+ reaching up to 12 million subscribers by 2024:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - ESPN+, Walt Disney Cos sports video streaming service, could attract between 8 million and 12 million paying subscribers by the end of the fiscal 2024 year, the company said on Thursday.FILE PHOTO: A screen shows the logo and a ticker symbol for The Walt Disney Company on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 14, 2017.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Disneys forecast for significant growth in paying customers in the next few years was disclosed in a presentation of its streaming video strategy to Wall Street.Operating losses for ESPN+ are expected to be $650 million annually in both fiscal 2019 and 2020, Disneys chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, said during an investor day webcast presentation.But the service, which launched one year ago, should reach profitability by 2023, she said.I view this positively because I think that they need to illustrate the subscriber growth to validate the investment.Theyre putting out some very strong number guides to the market, said Patrice Cucinello, a director at Fitch Ratings.Theyre going guns blazing at direct consumer.As cable and traditional media companies lose subscribers to the likes of Netflix Inc, they are building new streaming video businesses that appeal directly to consumers.Disney launched ESPN+ a year ago as a way to test its streaming services and distribute additional sports content directly to fans, for a monthly or yearly fee.Since then, ESPN+ has drawn millions of subscribers, inked sports rights deals, and seen its mobile app rise in popularity.Disney is also moving forward with its larger plans for Disney+, which will stream its trove of new and classic blockbuster movies.As for current paying sports fans, Disney said the number was currently over 2 million, or roughly what it disclosed in February.Disneys own estimates about ESPN+ growth seemed slightly higher than analysts, though its time frame was longer.Morgan Stanley analysts expect 2.7 million people to be paying for ESPN+ access by the end of fiscal 2019 and 3.9 million by the end of fiscal 2020.By 2022, it could have 6.7 million, Morgan Stanley said.MoffettNathanson gave a more modest outlook, predicting that ESPN+ will end fiscal 2019 flat, with just 2 million subscribers, growing to 4 million by 2022 and 5 million by 2023.Analysts at Citi predicted that ESPN+ would have 4 million paying subscribers by fiscal 2020.
Chicago sues Jussie Smollett over costs of investigating alleged attack:::::(Reuters) - The city of Chicago filed a lawsuit on Thursday against Jussie Smollett seeking three times the damages it said it incurred in the investigation of a hate crime that authorities allege the Empire actor staged.FILE PHOTO: Actor Jussie Smollett leaves court after charges against him were dropped by state prosecutors in Chicago, Illinois, U.S. March 26, 2019.REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski The lawsuit, which did not specify the amount of damages, was filed in Cook County Circuit Court over two weeks after prosecutors dismissed the criminal charges against Smollett alleging he fabricated the Jan. 29 attack.Chicago officials previously said they would sue Smollett after he refused a demand by the city for $130,000 to cover police overtime costs to investigate the actors claims.The lawsuit said Chicago would seek three times the amount of the damages the city sustained.The actors criminal defense attorney, Mark Geragos, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Geragos, who in the past has represented celebrities such as Michael Jackson, previously said Smollett will not be intimidated into paying the demanded sum.Smollett, 36, who is black and gay, ignited a firestorm on social media by telling police on Jan. 29 that two apparent supporters of President Donald Trump struck him, put a noose around his neck and poured bleach over him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs on a Chicago street.WEEKS OF INVESTIGATION After weeks of investigation, Chicago police determined that Smollett cooked up the scheme in which they allege he hired two brothers to pose as his attackers because he was dissatisfied with his salary on Empire.Smollett, best known for his role on the Twentieth Century Fox Television hip-hop drama, has said he has always been truthful about the incident.He was charged in February with staging the incident and filing a false police report, but Cook County States Attorneys Office prosecutors dropped all charges against him in March.Outgoing Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel described the decision as a whitewash of justice.Smollett admitted no wrongdoing, but agreed to do community service and give up $10,000 in bond money.It remains to be seen whether Chicagos mayor-elect, Lori Lightfoot, will pursue the legal case when she takes office on May 20.She said the States Attorneys Office had to better explain why it dropped charges and there should not be the perception there was one set of justice for the rich or famous and another for everyone else.
For the ultimate 'Game of Thrones' fan. How to speak Valyrian:::::(The March 10. story corrects the penultimate paraagraph to clarify only Valyrian offered on Duolingo, not Dothraki) By Alicia Powell NEW YORK (Reuters) - American linguist David J. Peterson may have built up the unique and ancient languages for the television series Game of Thrones but when it comes to who speaks Valyrian best, theres no contest.The best is Jacob Anderson, Peterson told Reuters.He plays Gray Worm on Game of Thrones and hes so good, hes so good.He is head and shoulders better than me.When I heard him the first time speak the Valyrian language I just said, wow.I went back and re-watched it, he said.Peterson, a co-founder of the Language Creation Society, started off by building on a few keys words and phrases created by George R.R.Martin in his A Song of Ice and Fire novels that form the basis of the HBO hit medieval fantasy series about warring families.I didnt reference any other languages.After I included all of (Martins) material I built it up in a way that I thought book readers and George R.R.Martin himself would expect and appreciate.When Peterson got the scripts for the TV show, producers tagged all the lines he had to translate into Valyrian or Dothraki.He then broke up the language syllable by syllable for the actors, and recorded it for them.I record really slow so they can hear exactly how its pronounced, and then I record the English for reference, Peterson said.FILE PHOTO: People walk past a large replica of the iron throne before the premiere of the final season of "Game of Thrones" at Radio City Music Hall in New York, U.S., April 3, 2019.REUTERS/Caitlin Ochs Although the final season of Game of Thrones starts on Sunday, the languages will go on living.Peterson has developed a course on the Duolingo foreign language app where fans can learn to speak Valyrian for free.According to the Duolingo app, there are currently over 800,000 active Valyrian learners - more than those learning Norwegian or Hindi.I also do all the recordings so thats my voice that youre hearing when you use the app.And I also take it myself because its nice to brush up, Peterson said.
Nepal bans online game PUBG citing negative impact on children:::::FILE PHOTO: Merchandising products are pictured at the PUBG Global Invitational 2018, the first official esports tournament for the computer game PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in Berlin, Germany, July 26, 2018.REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal on Thursday banned the popular online game PlayerUnknowns Battlegrounds (PUBG), saying its violent content had a negative impact on children, an official said.We have ordered the ban on PUBG because it is addictive to children and teenagers, Sandip Adhikari, deputy director at Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA), the nations telecoms regulator, told Reuters.The ban comes into effect from Thursday, he said.Following a request from the Himalayan nations federal investigation authority, the regulator directed all internet service providers, mobile operators and network service providers to block streaming of the game from Thursday onwards, Adhikari said.PUBG, made by South Korean firm Bluehole Inc, is a survival-themed battle game that drops dozens of online players on an island to try and eliminate each other.It was launched in 2017 and has a huge global following.Adhikari said so far there had been no reports of any incidents linked to the game.But he said parents were concerned about their children being distracted from their studies or other normal routine work.
Oscar-winner Rush wins defamation suit against News Corp's Australian arm:::::SYDNEY (Reuters) - Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush won damages of at least A$850,000 ($610,000) on Thursday after a court ruled that the Australian arm of News Corp defamed him by saying he behaved inappropriately toward a co-star in a production of King Lear.The Federal Court, which found News Corps Daily Telegraph tabloid in Sydney failed to prove its stories were true, will later determine further damages for economic harm, such as Rushs loss of movie roles and the effect on his career.This was in all the circumstances a recklessly irresponsible piece of sensationalist journalism of the worst kind, the very worst kind, Judge Michael Wigney said in a decision read to a crowded courtroom.Rush, 67, said the articles were hastily compiled because the Telegraph wanted an Australian angle on accusations of sexual assault leveled at U.S. film producer Harvey Weinstein.Wigney agreed and said the paper failed to properly inquire into the facts before it published.Daily Telegraph editor Ben English said News was disappointed with the decision and would review the judgment.Outside the court, Rush said he was pleased to acknowledge the verdict, but added it had been distressing for all involved.Since the accusations against Weinstein in 2017, scores of powerful men have been accused of sexual harassment or assault in a movement dubbed #MeToo.Under the headline KING LEER, and in later articles, the Daily Telegraph said Rush, playing the title role of a 2015 Sydney Theatre Company production of the Shakespeare play, had been accused by a co-star of unspecified inappropriate conduct.Rush, who won the Best Actor Oscar in 1997 for Shine and has since appeared in the Pirates of the Caribbean films, said the stories implied he was a major pervert, or guilty of major depravity, and his lawyer sought very substantial damages.Wigney found that readers could have drawn those conclusions, despite the vagueness of the articles, because of the #MeToo climate in which they were published.The articles did not name the accuser nor detail the conduct, and the actor, Eryn Jean Norvill, did not speak to the newspaper for its story nor want her complaint made public.Norvill, who played Lears daughter Cordelia, agreed to testify as part of the papers defense, and testified that during the production Rush touched her on the breast and humiliated her with sexual innuendo.On Thursday Justice Wigney questioned her reliability and credibility.In my view, Ms Norvill revealed herself to be a witness who was, at times, prone to exaggeration and embellishment, he said.He cited examples of differences between her testimony and that of Rush, who denied behaving inappropriately, and other actors involved in the play, who corroborated Rushs view.I stand by everything, Norvill said outside court, reading from a prepared statement.Australian actor Geoffrey Rush arrives at the Supreme Court in Sydney, Australia, April 11, 2019.AAP Image/Dylan Coker/via REUTERS She and Rush said the case had no winners and had been hurtful.Its been extremely distressing for everyone involved, Rush said at the top of the courthouse steps.($1=1.3965 Australian dollars)
The Game of Thrones effect: Central European film industry on a roll:::::PRAGUE (Reuters) - Its the kind of maneuvering that might make the Game of Thrones shrewdest operator Tyrion Lannister feel right at home.As streaming giants Amazon, Netflix and Hulu prepare to splash out on their next fantasy blockbusters and dystopian dramas, Central European countries are slugging it out to get a grab a slice of their bumper production budgets.Experienced crews, lower labor costs and generous production incentives have long attracted international filmmakers to the Czech Republic and Hungary but other countries in the region are now getting into the game.The Czechs and Hungarians are both considering raising their incentives after Romania approved a production rebate of up to 45 percent in 2018 and Poland introduced a 30 percent cash rebate in February to keep pace with its neighbors.A new European Union directive due to come in this year is also expected to spur investment as it will require video-on-demand platforms selling to European audiences to ensure at least 30 percent of their catalogs are European works.This is a new era, said Agnes Havas, chief executive of the Hungarian Film Fund told Reuters, noting that the Netflix series The Crown and Amazon Prime Videos Hanna were shot in Hungary.What we see is we started at 30 percent (incentives) and now we are looking at the other countries in Europe and we will evaluate the situation and see whether we should potentially think about raising it again in the future.BITG media analyst Rich Greenfield estimates Amazon will spend $5 billion to $6 billion in 2019 on content with Netflix laying out about $15 billion - and a significant portion of the Netflix budget will flow overseas.We are aware there is a shift in global production and you cant ignore the big streaming companies, Anna Dziedzic of the Film Commission Poland told Reuters.In 2018 Netflix filmed 1983 in the country, the companys first original Polish Netflix series.They are one of the biggest players now.You have to adjust to the changing environment and you have to have them in mind, Dziedzic told Reuters.Amazon and Netflix declined to comment on their plans in the region.GAME OF THRONES EFFECT A landscape dotted with castles and rolling countryside makes central Europe a versatile setting for increasingly popular historical and fantasy shows looking to cash in on the success of series such as Game of Thrones.The types of shows being shot have dramatically changed, said David Minkowski, head of production at Stillking Films, which co-produced Amazons neo-noir fantasy Carnival Row and Hulus historical series Das Boot, in the Czech Republic.Wigs are seen inside of a costume and props storage at the Barrandov Studio in Prague, Czech Republic, April 8, 2019.Picture taken April 8, 2019.REUTERS/David W Cerny Call it the Game of Thrones effect.A lot of it is fantasy or historical that naturally gravitates to this part of the world, he told Reuters, adding that the company was now working on fantasy drama The Witcher for Netflix.The typical production centers are bursting at the seams.Dziedzic at the Film Commission Poland said she has also received requests from international companies wanting to use post-Soviet locations and brutalist Communist architecture for science fiction series.This has helped push international investment in regional production to record highs, leaving studios booked a year in advance and crews forced to turn away work, industry professionals say.There is now an ever increased premium on local crew relationships and good access to infrastructure and studios which need to be planned up to 12 months in advance of production, added Stillkings Managing Director Matthew Stillking.Its a boom time ... likely to last several years as the sector becomes more competitive with a perfect storm of increased consumer viewing demand and more platforms needing content to compete for customers.IT WILL ROCKET Foreign investment in the Czech film industry leapt nearly 1.2 billion crowns to a record 4.8 billion ($210 million) on 1,072 shooting days for 38 foreign series and films in 2018, according to the Czech Film Commission.Investment is expected to remain at that level or higher this year, though Czech plans to increase cash rebates on offer for film makers from 20 percent now could be a game changer.It will rocket once the incentives are raised, Pavlina Zipkova, head of the Czech Film Commission, told Reuters.The government has not increased it yet but we strongly believe it will happen later this year.In Hungary, spending on a total of 333 productions last year amounted to 110 billion forints (385 million), with 84 percent of the investment coming from international productions including Hollywood blockbusters Terminator: Dark Fate and Gemini Man.This was up from 108 billion in 2017, when Red Sparrow and Colette were made in Hungary but Havas at Hungarys Film Fund expects the new EU rules to accelerate the streaming-fueled production boom.The rise of streaming services has also shifted the types of productions in the region.Hungary attracts more blockbuster films these days while episodic series tend to gravitate towards the Czech Republic, said Tomas Krejci, founder of Milk and Honey Pictures and Prague Studios.This helped Prague Studios turnover jump more than 50 percent in 2018 - and Krejci predicts demand will remain strong as top notch crews shooting historical shows are more than a third cheaper than in rival countries such as Spain.The demand for historical shows is getting stronger, Krejci said whose company has produced Haunted for Netflix and Amazons Patriot and the second season of Lore.Slideshow (14 Images) Here its not just the phenomenal historic architecture but also the vast amount of props, costumes and local talent that make it cheaper and easier to make these kinds of shows.($1 = 22.8160 Czech crowns) ($1 = 285.6800 forints)

Disney's 'Lion King' remake roars to life with new trailer:::::LONDON (Reuters) - With stunning scenery of Africa and some talking wildlife, Disney dropped its first full length trailer for its realistic-looking remake of The Lion King on Wednesday, offering a glimpse of the highly anticipated film.The new movie, made with computer-generated imagery, follows the plot of the Oscar winning 1994 animation about lion cub Simba, who flees his kingdom after his villainous uncle Scar connives to take his father Mufasas place as king.It boasts a voice cast that includes music star Beyonce and actors Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Seth Rogen and James Earl Jones, who voiced Mufasa in the 1994 version.Counting down 100 days until the films July release, the trailer begins with Scar, surrounded by hyenas, telling Simba: Lifes not fair, is it, my little friend?While some are born to feast, others spend their lives in the dark, begging for scraps.Under 2 minutes long, it shows off the Pride Rock setting, with glimpses of Simbas childhood friend and love interest Nala as well as new pals Timon and Pumbaa.As well as Scar, Mufasas voice is also heard in the trailer.The Lion King was an instant hit with audiences around the world when it was released, and a hugely successful musical theater version still runs on New Yorks Broadway and in London.The new trailer, which follows a first look of the film in November, garnered nearly 1.5 million views in the first two hours after it was posted on Disneys Twitter feed.The film is the latest Disney remake to hit screens this year.It is directed by Jon Favreau, who was behind the 2016 remake of The Jungle Book.
Cinema vs. streaming: the battle over when and where you can see movies:::::LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - While superheroes, monsters and aliens battle on the big screen, a real-life fight is raging behind the scenes that will determine what moviegoers will see at their local cinemas.The off-screen skirmish centers around the theatrical window, the time a movie plays exclusively in U.S. theaters before it can be released on DVD or digital.That period averages 90 days, but upheaval across the media business is fueling debate on whether that should shrink.At stake is the future of movie theaters and small-screen entertainment as new technology giants upend decades of Hollywood tradition.Netflix Inc has streamed original movies at the same time, or just a few weeks after, their debut in cinemas.Competitor Amazon Studios has said it would like some of its films to play for only two to eight weeks in theaters before hitting the Amazon Prime Video streaming service.Many theater owners object, citing potential damage to their business.The group that awards the Oscars is weighing whether to respond, and A-list celebrities are taking sides.Adam Aron, chief executive of AMC Entertainment Holdings, the worlds largest theater operator, said his company would consider any and all alternatives but any changes to the current industry standard would have to be beneficial to us or neutral to us.Even the king of the multiplex - Walt Disney Co - is getting into streaming, and is set to unveil details on Thursday of its strategy.That has stoked concern that it, too, might want movies in living rooms sooner.Disney executives insist they remain rock-solid behind existing windows for big event films.Disneys franchise fare such as Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War generated a total $7.3 billion at global box offices in 2018.At a recent CinemaCon convention for theater owners in Las Vegas, Disney and other studios stressed the special experience of watching a film in a darkened theater.A lot more people have had their first kiss in a movie theater than their parents living room, said Toby Emmerich, a senior executive at Warner Bros., part of AT&T Incs WarnerMedia, which also plans a streaming push.Oscar-winning actress Helen Mirren was more forthright.I love Netflix, but fuck Netflix!she said to cheers and applause.Theres nothing like sitting in the cinema and the lights go down.Netflix is in talks to buy the Egyptian Theatre, a historic movie house in the heart of Hollywood, a source with knowledge of the matter said.Netflix would host premieres and other industry events at the theater, which opened in 1922, the source said.Amazon Studios boss Jennifer Salke, meanwhile, declared the company committed to the theatrical experience.In June, it is slated to release comedy Late Night in theaters, with a traditional window.FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is seen on their office in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 16, 2018.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo Shorter windows would keep some customers at home, said Greg Marcus, chief executive of The Marcus Corporation, owner of the fourth-largest U.S. theater chain.If you damage the business and take away 10 percent of our customers, we wont be able to reinvest in the theatrical experience, Marcus said.That would ultimately hurt content providers.Others said consumers are happy with the current system.Ticket sales in 2018 reached a record $41 billion globally and $12 billion in the United States and Canada, even as Netflix released about 90 movies for streaming.Were not talking about something thats broken, Vue International cinemas CEO Tim Richards said in an interview.OSCAR SHOWDOWN Windowing is expected to be on the agenda this month at a meeting about rules governing the Academy Awards.Some members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences, the group that awards the Oscars, have been debating whether films must play in theaters for a specific length of time to be eligible.Director Steven Spielberg told Britains ITV News last year that movies seen primarily via streaming should compete for Emmys, not Oscars.A representative declined to comment on whether the director will urge the Academy to address the issue.In February, Netflix won three Oscars for Roma, which streamed three weeks after a limited theatrical debut.Netflix tweeted that it loved cinema but also supported access for people who cannot afford, or do not live close to, theaters.The Justice Department has waded in, warning the Academy that some eligibility limits could be anti-competitive.An Academy spokesperson said any changes would be weighed at the April 23 meeting.The issue could flare up later this year when Netflix releases The Irishman, a mob drama directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.Filmmakers hope The Irishman will play broadly in theaters, De Niro said in an interview, though they realize Netflixs chief audience is its streaming customers.Slideshow (2 Images) Theyre not going to cut their noses to spite their face, De Niro said.We get it.This kind of movie has to be presented that way.But he added: Were working it out so we can have as much theatrical as possible.
AT&T not planning to sell HBO Europe: WarnerMedia CEO:::::An AT&T logo is pictured in Pasadena, California, U.S., January 24, 2018.REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni (Reuters) - WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey denied a report on Wednesday that parent company AT&T was considering selling its HBO Europe business, calling it baseless and inaccurate.The Financial Times report, citing current and former senior executives, said AT&T had internally discussed selling HBO Europe as part of efforts to reduce a debt pile of $170 billion.We normally do not comment on speculation, but when a news outlet is advised that their reporting is factually incorrect and report it anyway, we feel compelled to set the record straight, Stankey, who heads the newly created unit of AT&T, said in a statement.There is no truth whatsoever to the Financial Times story saying AT&T is or has considered selling HBO Europe.Its completely baseless and inaccurate.HBO Europe is a valuable asset for our growth plans in Europe.The paper said that HBO Europe was one of several assets AT&T had considered selling but that it had not held formal talks with any potential buyers.In November, AT&T said it had committed to cutting its heavy debt load in 2019 through a variety of measures, including a review of all of its non-core assets such as its stake in streaming video company Hulu for possible sale.

FBI's 'art cops': In hot pursuit of Renoirs, Rembrandts and ruby slippers:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - When a 17th century Dutch painting looted by the Nazis turned up for sale in New York in late 2017, the FBIs Art Crime Team moved in, verified its identity and helped win a court order to return the work to its rightful owners.FILE PHOTO: A pair of ruby slippers featured in the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota in 2005, is shown after it was recovered in a sting operation conducted in Minneapolis earlier this summer in this FBI Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., image released on September 4, 2018.Courtesy FBI/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo It was the latest of many high-profile cases for the 22-person Federal Bureau of Investigation division dedicated to solving a wide array of art-related crimes at an agency that is better known for chasing bank robbers, spies and other criminal rogues.Solomon Konincks 17th-century painting A Scholar Sharpening His Quill, was one of many treasures belonging to the family of art collector Adolphe Schloss that were seized by the Nazi-supporting Vichy government in France 75 years ago.The portrait, which once adorned Adolph Hitlers Munich offices, disappeared at the end of World War Two.It resurfaced at Christies auction house, which tipped off the FBI unit last year that a Chilean art dealer was trying to sell it.The evidence was really overwhelming, FBI Special Agent Chris McKeogh said, days after the works formal repatriation to the Schloss heirs in early April.There was really no question that this was the painting in question.In its early days, recalled Robert Wittman, the Art Crime Teams founding chief, being art cops was not exactly a path to directorship.But after 14 years, the team is getting more respect from fellow agents after several headline-grabbing recoveries in the United States of art works and other cultural property, Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter said.People just think what were doing is cool, said Carpenter, who now runs the unit from the FBIs Washington headquarters.I think weve changed a lot of perceptions, even within the organization, he said.So now my phone rings off the hook weekly for folks wanting to be on the team.Since it was founded in 2005, the team has recovered nearly 15,000 objects worth nearly $800 million and secured more than 90 convictions.CHAGALL, RENOIR AND RUBY SLIPPERS Last year alone, its recoveries included a painting by Marc Chagall that had been taken from the Manhattan home of an elderly couple nearly 30 years earlier, a Nazi-looted work by artist Auguste Renoir and a pair of ruby slippers worth millions worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz.It is not the money, Carpenter stressed, but rather the intrinsic value of stolen art and cultural property - anything from baseball cards to a $5 million Stradivarius - that determines whether the FBI will pursue it.The red sequined shoes stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Minnesota 13 years ago were a prime example.People responded to that case, he said.They said this is really important; this is a piece of Americana.Agents selected for the team must understand why art and culture matter to humanity, Carpenter said.Agent McKeogh pinpointed his art awakening to a college backpacking trip in Paris.On an obligatory visit to the Mona Lisa at the Louvre, he happened to pass Pierre-Narcisse Guerins 18th-century oil painting The Return of Marcus Sextus.I found a painting that spoke to me and spent about a half-hour sitting in front it, said McKeogh, who is based in New York.And from there, I was really hooked.MOST VEXING UNSOLVED CASE The United States was lagging far behind European countries in art crime-fighting resources when Wittman helped launch the team in 2005, partly to track down antiquities that were looted from the Baghdad Museum after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.Now a private consultant, Wittman was the bureaus original art sleuth.He said art thieves were always most vulnerable when they tried to unload their high-profile, ill-gotten gains.The real art in art heists is not the stealing, its the selling, said Wittman, who had recovered more than $300 million in stolen art when he retired in 2008 after 20 years.While there are no reliable statistics on art crime, Carpenter said he thinks technology is making things worse because stolen works and forgeries can be sold anonymously on online marketplaces.If the Art Crime Teams most vexing case is a daring 1990 heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in which thieves made off with 13 pieces by Dutch masters Rembrandt and Vermeer and other artists worth half a billion dollars.Despite a $10 million reward, none of them has been recovered, and the theft, considered to be among the biggest in art history, looms as the teams most glaring unsolved case.Theres not a single person on the Art Crime Team that doesnt dream of the day that we can recover those pieces, said Carpenter.
Lives washed away: A mother's loss in Mozambique:::::CHEIA, Mozambique (Reuters) - Maria Jofresse cannot find her two young daughters graves, though she helped dig them herself.A tear falls down the face of Maria Jofresse, 25, during an interview with Reuters at a camp for the displaced in the aftermath of Cyclone Idai, in John Segredo, near Beira, Mozambique, March 31, 2019.REUTERS/Zohra Bensemra A single teardrop swells beneath each of her dark eyes as she recalls the moment the girls were snatched away by the fast-flowing floodwaters.It took four days to find their bodies, which were buried where Cyclone Idai had left them, far from where they lived.I cannot recognize it anymore, the 25-year-old mother said, drying her eyes with a patch of patterned skirt at a makeshift camp of blue tarpaulin, near the riverside village of Cheia.I cannot find them.On the night of the storm, Jofresse took shelter at her mother-in-laws house with her husband and children, a 6-month-old baby and 4-year-old girl.The next day, the river beside the village broke its banks and water rushed in.The family fled, trying to reach the main road, which lies on higher ground.But the water was too quick.Afraid theyd drown, the family climbed into a single cashew tree.For 11 hours they clung to its branches, Jofresse cradling the baby while her husband held their eldest girl.At 10 pm, in total darkness, the flood ripped the trees roots from the soaked earth, throwing the family into the fast-flowing water and separating them.Jofresse survived by grabbing onto another tree.The next day, wading through the now largely stagnant water, she found her husband.Together they searched for the girls.On the morning of the fourth day, they found the body of their eldest, and in the afternoon, their lifeless baby.The children were among more than 800 people killed in the storm and the heavy rains before it struck Mozambique and two other southern African countries, Zimbabwe and Malawi.After digging two small graves, the couple joined other families at the camp set up just a few kilometers (miles) from their destroyed home.We will stay here, because theres nothing to go back to, Jofresse said, sitting in a small square of shade at the camp.You can come and live with me, her father, Joao Jofresse Ngira, interjected, distraught at his daughters pain.Jofresse does not answer.It is not the first time she has lost a home.In 2000, when she was just 5, devastating floods destroyed her nearby village of Mashongo.The government moved the family to a new community, built for those with nowhere to go after that disaster.Ngira showed Reuters around the village, located by the River Muda.It became known as Cheia, or Flood in Portuguese - because we were brought here from the water, he explained.The spot was chosen because it was on higher ground and less prone to flooding.It was meant to be safe, he said, standing outside the ruins of the four-room house the government helped him build.Five young children played in the pile of broken bricks and cracked cement.Cheias fate shows how climate change is threatening places that just under two decades ago were considered safe.United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the catastrophe in Mozambique rings yet another alarm bell about the dangers of global warming, which scientists say will make devastating storms like Cyclone Idai more frequent.Since this disaster, we havent seen anyone from the government, even though theyre the ones that put us here, Ngira said.Asked if he would like to move somewhere else, he looks down at his muddy yellow trainers, before replying: I dont have any money.Its best not to dream.On the Sunday Reuters visited, the camp bustled with rumors that food would be delivered that afternoon.It had been a week since the last bit of aid arrived and people were hungry.Jofresse canceled a memorial service for her daughters because she feared the food might arrive while she was gone.Slideshow (24 Images) When the aid finally comes, Jofresse unpacks the parcel in her blue tent.There is a set of nappies.She puts them to one side.Click on reut.rs/2UHekC4 for a related photo essay.
Netflix in talks to buy Hollywood's historic Egyptian Theatre: source:::::FILE PHOTO: Grauman's Egyptian theatre is seen as preparations continue for the 81st Academy Awards in Hollywood, California February 19, 2009.REUTERS/Danny Moloshok/File Photo LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Netflix Inc is in discussions to buy the Egyptian Theatre, a historic movie house in the heart of Hollywood, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.The worlds dominant streaming service would use the Los Angeles venue to host film premieres and other industry events, the source said.There are no current plans to sell tickets to the public.Netflix has been at odds with many theater owners because it has resisted the traditional industry practice of showing films exclusively in cinemas for roughly 90 days.Instead, Netflix sends theatrical releases to its online service on the same day or just a few weeks after they hit the big screen.The Egyptian Theatre opened in 1922 with the first-ever movie premiere, a screening of Robin Hood starring Douglas Fairbanks.The current owner is the non-profit American Cinematheque, which hosts screenings of classic films and would still offer programming on weekends, according to the source.American Cinematheque did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S. slaps more charges on parents in college admissions cheating scandal:::::BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors filed fresh conspiracy and money laundering charges on Tuesday against 16 parents charged with paying bribes to secure their children seats in elite universities in the largest college admissions scam uncovered in U.S. history.Parents including Full House actor Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli had already been charged with racketeering conspiracy for their alleged role in the scheme, in which parents paid some $25 million in bribes to secure their offspring places at universities including Yale, Georgetown and the University of Southern California.Fourteen parents, including Desperate Housewives star Felicity Huffman, on Monday pleaded guilty to taking part in the scam, masterminded by California college admissions consultant William Rick Singer.Singer last month pleaded guilty to facilitating the cheating scam and bribing coaches to present the parents children as fake athletic recruits.Prosecutors have not yet charged any applicants and said that in some cases the parents involved took steps to try to prevent their children from realizing they were benefiting from fraud.Colleges have begun revoking the admissions and pursuing expulsion of students who obtained their seats as a result of the fraud.

Dance-offs, tears and tributes as rapper Nipsey Hussle takes one final tour:::::Hours after thousands gathered to say goodbye to rapper Nipsey Hussle during a memorial at Staples Center in Los Angeles, throngs lined the streets and climbed poles Thursday night to watch the procession pass by.Choking back tears, they tossed roses at the car carrying the silver hearse as it made its way through the crowds.At the end of the 25.5-mile procession that included a stop at the rapper's Marathon clothing store, his body was taken to a funeral home in South Los Angeles.Outside, people held a dance-off, a fitting end to a memorial described as a celebration of life for the rapper.The hearse carrying the remains of rapper Nipsey Hussle arrives at the Angelus Funeral Home.A hometown son who never left The day of tributes started with a memorial service at the packed 21,000-seat Staples Center, where fans, family members and celebrities celebrated his life.They applauded his commitment to the South Los Angeles community in which he grew up and later invested in.His clothing store where he was gunned down last month symbolized his ties to the neighborhood and was transformed into a memorial where fans left flowers and balloons after the shooting.A letter from former President Barack Obama -- read by the rapper's longtime friend Karen Civil -- acknowledged his love for his community."While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets, and despair, Nipsey saw potential," Obama wrote."He saw hope.He saw a community that, even through its flaws, taught him to always keep going.His choice to invest in that community rather than ignore it."A woman cries as the hearse carrying the remains of rapper Nipsey Hussle arrives at the funeral home.A father and a final act of love In her eulogy, Hussle's girlfriend , Lauren London, also highlighted his close ties to the city."I know everybody is hurting.But I'd like to say something to my city of Los Angeles," London said. "...This pain is ours.We know what it meant to us.We lost an incredible soul.We lost somebody very rare to us.We lost a real one and we won't ever be the same."The couple dated for more than five years and had one of the most enduring fairytale romances in hip-hop.They shared a 2-year-old son, Kross Asghedom.London described him as the love of her life and a man who made her feel loved and protected."Grief is the final act of love," she said."My heart hears you.I feel you everywhere.I'm so grateful that I had you.I love you beyond this Earth.And, until we meet again, the marathon continues."Nipsey Hussle's girlfrend, Lauren London, and their children paid tribute to the beloved rapper.A rapper admired by his peers At the funeral service, hip-hop luminaries and activists expressed their admiration for the rapper for using his voice to reach out to his neighborhood and beyond.Rapper Snoop Dogg described their relationship as that of two magnets -- drawn to each other.He told the story of the no-frills way Hussle tried to get him to listen to his music when they first met."Just give it a listen," he said Hussle told him, which struck him as odd.Most rappers promise that they'll "make you a million dollars," he said.But not Hussle.While the two shared a kinship -- both from LA, lanky with braids and a street gang affiliation -- Hussle's kind spirit stood out, he said.He was an advocate for peace and even made music with rival gang members, he said."This man got a letter from Barack Obama, man," Snoop Dogg said, before saluting the coffin surrounded by white flowers.Nation of Islam Minister Farrakhan talked about Hussle's efforts to forge ties between his Crips street gang and the rival Bloods.He was to hip-hop what Bob Marley was to reggae, Farrakhan said.Snoop Dogg speaks at the memorial for Nipsey Hussle.An activist who brought together two countries Hussle -- born Ermias Asghedom -- was the son of an Eritrean father.Some of the cars in his funeral procession were draped in Eritrean flags.Eritreans in the US have held candlelight vigils nationwide since he was killed.A resident of the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles wore shoes in tribute to Nipsey Hussle.Video played at his memorial showed him traveling to his father's birthplace in East Africa and practicing the local language.His father, Dawit Asghedom, described how his resilience was evident from day one after he was born with his umbilical cord around his neck but still pulled through.His mother, Angelique Smith, said she was at peace and consoled those mourning her son."I have perfect peace.I am happy.I am complete.I am strong.And if I can feel this way, you can, too," she told the thousands of people gathered at the funeral service.Eritrea-born activist Wintana Nelekin traveled from Minnesota to honor the man she once met after organizing a speech for young people in Minneapolis.She said he taught her that her opportunities were boundless.Masons attend a memorial celebration for Nipsey Hussle."He showed me a vision of how to be a community organizer, how to be an entrepreneur, how to be a community leader.And you don't get a lot of that today," she said.Photographer Latrell Parker traveled from Fredericksburg, Virginia, to honor the rapper.His shirt was adorned with the musician's image and the caption "The Marathon Continues," the title of one of Hussle's mixtapes.

BTS! We haven't seen boy-band fandom like this since the Beatles:::::(CNN) If you haven't heard of BTS yet, it's time to succumb to the inevitable: The Korean boy band is taking over the world.This is One Direction big.This is Beatlemania big.And while K-pop music isn't exactly a new sensation outside of Korea, BTS and similar groups are cultivating devoted followings across the globe, elevating K-pop from a niche import to a full-blown international movement.Pre-orders for "Map of the Soul: Persona," have surpassed 3 million copies, Big Hit, their management company, told CNN.Their two most recent two albums -- "Love Yourself: Tear" and "Love Yourself: Answer" -- each sold around 2 million copies.So before our new K-pop overlords become any more powerful, it's time to get to know them.Here are 12 essential facts about BTS and the colossal, churning K-pop industry that spawned them.JUST WATCHED K-pop group BTS scores worldwide success Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH K-pop group BTS scores worldwide success 01:11 1.BTS officially stands for 'Beyond the Scene.'But that's not what people typically call them When BTS was first fully formed in 2013, they took their name from the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan, which roughly translates to "bulletproof boy scouts."In 2017, as their profile rose among English-speaking audiences, the group announced they were shifting the meaning of the acronym to "Beyond the Scene" in a nod to the themes of empowerment and individuality in their music.It depends where in the world you are, but most likely, you'll hear people refer to the group as BTS, the Bangtan Boys, or for Japanese audiences, Bodan Shonen Dan 2.The seven members each have stage names It's not uncommon for K-pop groups to have more members than a starting hockey lineup, and BTS has a grand total of seven: RM (previously Rap Monster)/ Kim Nam Joon Jungkook/ Jeon Jeong-guk Jin/ Kim Seok Jin Suga/ Min Yoon Gi J-Hope/ Jung Ho Seok Jimin/ Park Ji Min V/ Kim Tae Hyung Here they are, in pastel glory, at the Seoul Music Awards in January: V, Suga, Jin, Jungkook, RM, Jimin and J-Hope at the 2019 Seoul Music Awards.3.K-pop stars are called 'idols' because of the intense fandoms they inspire It may seem like hyperbole, but the term "idol" is pretty accurate when it comes to the passion and devotion K-pop artists command, and you'll often hear the term thrown around for a group as a whole and its individual members.It's long been a convention of boy band fanatics to have a favorite member, and in K-pop circles, fans call their favorite member their "bias."South Korean K-Pop fans cheer during a 2019 concernt in Suwon, South Korea.4.BTS fans call themselves ARMY, and like all boy-band devotees, are incredibly loyal ARMY (not "the Army," educate yourself) is like any other massive fan group with a cool name , but with everything dialed up to 11.Since BTS has international and cross-lingual appeal, being a part of ARMY is as much about interacting with and supporting other fans as it is about supporting the group.ARMY members from across the world will gather online at all hours to watch and enjoy a BTS appearance in a different time zone, or translate different BTS news and interviews so more fans can enjoy it.Memes, handmade products, fan art and fan fiction also connect ARMY members across the globe.Unfortunately, the sheer size of ARMY also means there's a high potential for toxic drama, unhealthy obsessions and online abuse between members, as well as intense animosity toward anyone who dare speak ill of BTS.Of course, that kind of behavior is hardly endemic to BTS, K-pop or the music industry (hello, all sports ever).It just may be more noticeable with a fandom that's massive, non-centralized and highly social media-savvy.Fans pose outside a BTS concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles in September 2018.5.BTS' success is comparable to other boy-band sensations Again, BTS' success isn't new, but there's a difference between being a popular act and being a worldwide icon.In 2017, they beat out the likes of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez to win the Billboad Music Award for Top Social Artists of the Year, and became the first Korean artists to take home a BBMA prize Their BBMAs appearance was a coming-out party of sorts, and since then, they've been everywhere ; on "Ellen," on the "Late Late Show with James Corden," and on the cover of virtually every major entertainment magazine ever.They've also had two albums hit #1 on the Billboard 100 chart: " Love Yourself: Answer " and " Love Yourself: Tear ," both in 2018.It was the first time a group had two #1 albums in the same year since you guessed it One Direction in 2014."Love Yourself: Her" also topped iTunes' top-selling album chart in 73 countries and territories after its release.6.Social media is an essential part of their success BTS also holds several Guinness World records, including the most Twitter engagements and the most music video views within a 24-hour period (records that had previously belonged to One Direction's Harry Styles and Taylor Swift, respectively).That kind of achievement is indicative of just how important social media is in uniting BTS with their fans, and the fans with each other.Only one member of BTS Kim Nam Joon speaks English fluently, though several others are conversational, so social media is an ideal place to connect with fans.Not to mention, there's a rich and rather hilarious meme culture among ARMY members, who tend to be young women already fluent in the esoteric vernacular of the internet.Every time one of the boys in BTS does something weird, adorable or relatable, it almost instantly becomes a reaction meme or an in-joke or some other little part of a vast and ever-expanding K-pop discourse that spans distance and language.Mattel recently broke the internet when they released a line of BTS dolls.7.BTS' influence goes beyond music True to their adopted English acronym, "Beyond the Scene," BTS' focus on socially relevant topics like mental health and the nature of fame has boosted their influence outside of the music industry."Tell me your story.I want to hear your voice, and I want to hear your conviction," Kim Nam Joon, aka RM, said during the address ."No matter who you are, where you're from, your skin color, gender identity: speak yourself."8.The K-pop industry is a highly regulated machine whose artists are hand-picked and trained for superstardom All messages of authenticity aside, the reality is K-pop acts don't typically start out as a bunch of people futzing around with guitars in their parents' garage.The groups are usually specifically put together by large Korean entertainment companies, and hopeful members train for years to perfect their dancing and singing skills It's an extremely demanding, expensive and often alienating process, and auditions for groups are highly competitive.Once a hopeful becomes an idol, they are expected to maintain a squeaky-clean and non-controversial presence to minimize any risk to their carefully created images.So even though aspiring idols may end up with untold riches, fame and admiration, it all comes at a great risk and a steep price.9.Aesthetics are a huge part of the K-pop game In addition to being amazing dancers and capable singers, K-pop artists must also be ethereally, invariably attractive.After all, being an idol isn't just about being a skilled performer, it's also about being a easily marketable sex symbol.Perfect skin, slim bodies, stunning hair and a cutting edge fashion sense are absolutely critical to the idol formula.It's not just about physical attractiveness, either.Every aspect of the K-pop genre, from pastel hairstyles to red carpet fashion to stunning music videos and album art, is presented with a rich and meticulously curated visual aesthetic.In a way, K-pop is as much art for the eyes as it is for the ears, and while this is a huge draw for fans, it can also be a discouraging reminder of the manufactured image the genre often favors.The members of BTS pay careful attention to their hair, clothes and overall look.10.One reason BTS is so popular is because their music focuses on themes of vulnerability and self love There are plenty of uber-popular K-pop groups and artists who have courted international appeal in the last few years (BigBang and Psy come to mind).So why has BTS in particular seen such unprecedented success?One popular theory is that their music tends to be particularly introspective, emotional, empowering and hyper-aware of the machinations of perfection and conformity that often drive the K-pop industry.Even their 2014 debut single, "No More Dream," was an anthem against conformity: What is you that you dreamed of?Who do you see in your mirror, I gotta say: Go your own way.One of their most recent singles, "Idol," celebrates individuality and confidence: I know what I am, I know what I want, I'm never going to change...You can't stop me from loving myself.(As a testament to BTS' international success, a version of "Idol" also features a guest verse from rapper Nicki Minaj.)Members of BTS arrive at K-CON at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena on August 10, 2014.11.You won't hear many all-English K-pop songs Speaking of songs, you're probably not going to hear BTS actually sing their songs in English.K-pop songs tend to be mostly, if not exclusively, performed in Korean.You might hear an English word or phrase, and on occasion a rapped or spoken verse in English, but the built-in language barrier is a standard operating procedure for the genre.(There are notable exceptions, of course: BlackPink's massive new release, "Kill This Love," has entire verses and refrains in English .)Still, the language difference makes K-pop's rise even more impressive: Most fans outside of Korea probably have only the barest grasp of the language, but will joyfully burst into broken sing-alongs whenever the latest BTS jam comes on.12.The broader culture of K-pop is complex and sometimes toxic While BTS' success has relied heavily on their messages of non-conformity and self esteem, their fame still exists within what some consider a problematic industry that purposefully limits the privacy and individuality of its stars.(After all, K-pop idols are usually not even allowed to date , lest they ruin the fantasy of attainability for their fans.)It's also a widely held observation that K-pop's heavy reliance on perfection and precision reflect stringent expectations and social norms that are commonplace in Korean culture as a whole.In February, South Korea's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family released guidelines warning that the homogenous, highly-groomed K-pop "look" could cause some fans to develop skewed standards of beauty."Beauty standards of music shows is a serious problem," the guildelines said."Most of them are idol band members but they don't represent various appearances (of society)."The guidelines were pulled days later after a deafening outcry from K-pop fans, who likened the guidelines to censorship.JUST WATCHED K-Pop stars named in growing South Korea sex scandal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH K-Pop stars named in growing South Korea sex scandal 00:53 For some, the scandal which doesn't involve BTS reveals ugliness that can fester under K-pop's veneer of perfection, and speaks to a larger culture of toxic masculinity in Korea that is increasingly attracting criticism.Could the scandal taint the gleaming worldwide rise of K-pop?Will BTS' commitment to empowerment and social responsibility inoculate them against such ignominy?No one knows, but what's certain is BTS' global success shows no signs of slowing down.
Olivia Jade is 'devastated' by college cheating scandal:::::(CNN) YouTube star Olivia Jade Giannulli is "devastated" by the allegations her parents are facing in the college admissions scandal.Giannulli's parents, actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are among 33 parents accused of paying bribes for their children to attend prestigious institutions."Olivia is devastated and completely embarrassed.She feels like she's lost nearly all of her friends because of this.She's barely speaking to her parents," a friend who has been in communication with her told CNN.Her parents are accused of paying $500,000 to a fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits.The daughters did not participate in the sport.Giannulli, who goes by Olivia Jade, has been a student at the University of Southern California since the fall of 2018.
How 'Game of Thrones' conquered with drama and dragons:::::(CNN) Those uninitiated in the "Game of Thrones" phenomenon must surely wonder what all the fuss is about, especially as the HBO drama becomes increasingly difficult to avoid in the build-up to its series finale.Dragons and debauchery, after all, don't sound like much of a breakthrough.While there's seldom a simple explanation for why something catches on in Hollywood -- to quote the late screenwriter William Goldman, "Nobody knows anything" -- the show's popularity stems in part from how well it has bridged the gap between movies and TV, between theatrical blockbusters and dense serialized drama.HBO has long since shed its old "It's not TV.It's HBO" slogan.But "Game of Thrones" managed to occupy a realm that falls somewhere beyond conventional TV, answering the question what it would look like if "The Sopranos" and "Star Wars" had a baby, with all the pop-culture hysteria that entails."Thrones" also had the benefit of being based on George R.R.Martin's popular novels, bringing a dedicated fan base along with it.Yet much like "The Walking Dead," the series took on a screen life of its own, and in this case actually lapped its source material, wrapping up the story before the author could get around to publishing it.Read More
'Transparent' is killing off Jeffrey Tambor's character:::::(CNN) RIP Maura."Transparent" creator, Jill Soloway, has confirmed the upcoming series finale will feature the death of the show's central character, played by actor Jeffrey Tambor, who was dismissed from the show last year over accusations of harassment toward others on set.In a statement after his firing, the actor called the allegations against him "false.""When the time came to bring the 'Transparent' journey to a close, it was clear that saying goodbye to Maura was our path forward," Soloway said in a statement via Amazon."In this musical finale, we dramatize the death of Maura in an odyssey of comedy and melancholy told through the joyful prism of melody and dance."Tambor played Maura Pfefferman, a father who comes out as transgender to his wife and children, since 2014.Read More

Lori Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli are 'not ready' to make a plea in college admissions scandal:::::(CNN) Actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, are "not ready" to enter a plea for their alleged role in the college admissions scandal, a source close to the actress said."They are not ready to make a plea like Felicity (Huffman) and go down that road.They are hoping to just let this play out in the judicial system.They are innocent until proven guilty," a source close to Loughlin told CNN."They wish the media would just leave them alone.They feel like there is no story and don't understand why the press keep hounding them and following Lori to yoga."The couple appeared last week in federal court in Boston but have not publicly indicated how they plan to plead.Actress Felicity Huffman and others have agreed to plead guilty in the case.Loughlin and Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 to a fake charity to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as crew recruits, even though the daughters did not participate in the sport.Read More
Wendy Williams files for divorce from Kevin Hunter:::::(CNN) Wendy Williams is getting divorced.Williams filed the a petition to divorce her husband of more than 20 years, Kevin Hunter, in New Jersey on Thursday morning, according to a friend of the talk show host.A representative for Williams declined to comment."Wendy and her family have been a part of Debmar-Mercury for over 10 years," a spokesperson from "The Wendy Williams Show" said to CNN in a statement."We respect their privacy regarding personal matters.As always, we remain committed to bringing an entertaining and topical show to our viewers."Williams and Hunter married in 1997 and together they have a 19-year-old son.Hunter serves as Williams' manager and is also a producer on her show.Read More
Avicii's new song 'SOS' talks about sleepless nights and a restless mind:::::(CNN) Avicii's first posthumous song, "SOS," is out nearly a year after the death of the Swedish superstar DJ.The new song features vocals by American singer Aloe Blacc, who worked with Avicii on the 2013 hit, "Wake Me Up."The new track is part of the album called "Tim" -- Avicii's real name is Tim Bergling.His collaborators Albin Nedler and Kristoffer Fogelmark released a video explaining how important it was for them to finish their friend's work and the challenges they faced.The pair said they sought out Blacc for the vocals because Avicii had expressed interest in working with him again after the success of their previous hit.The accompanying video shows a dark background, and touching messages and memories from some of Avicii's fans.Lyrics are about some of Avicii's battles Blacc said he was honored that Avicii wanted him on his album."I feel like 'SOS' was a song that was probably ahead of its time for when he wrote it," Blacc said."He wrote these lyrics obviously about some of his battles and I think it's a really important topic to approach and to share ... to give people the words to be able to say, 'I need help.'"The song features words that carry more weight in retrospect.They include lyrics about a man who does not get much sleep and relies on love to pull him back from the brink."Can you hear me SOS?"Blacc sings."Help me put my mind to rest."It also talks about love, drugs and relationships, and the stress that comes with it."I get robbed of all my sleep.As my thoughts begin to leave.I'd let go but I don't know how.Yeah I don't know how but I need to now," Blacc sings.In true Avicii fashion, the hook is catchy and electrifying, and is sure to send crowds to the dance floor despite the song's solemn message.Aloe Blacc Album will raise money for mental health Avicii's family said the rest of the album will be out on June 6, and comprises his remaining work before he died."He left behind a collection of nearly finished songs, along with notes, email conversations and text messages about the music," his representatives said.The DJ and producer died on April 20, 2018, at age 28.His family started a foundation in his honor to raise money for mental health and suicide prevention.Net proceeds from the album will benefit the Tim Bergling Foundation.
David Oyelowo shines in 'Les Misérables' miniseries:::::(CNN) "Les Misrables" is hardly lacking for adaptations, from multiple movies to the long-running musical.Yet Victor Hugo's durable 19th-century soap opera gets a lavish, inordinately expansive makeover with a new six-hour production featuring Dominic West and David Oyelowo, one that fleshes out characters and situations normally given short shrift on screen.Adapted by Andrew Davies ("Bleak House"), directed by Tom Shankland ("The Missing") and counting its leads among the producers, this BBC-backed "Les Miz" provides plenty of detail about West's Jean Valjean, naturally, and a meaty role for Oyelowo as the dogged inspector who first torments him in prison, then pursues him once he's fled.Where this impeccably produced edition of PBS' "Masterpiece" truly excels, though, is in the intricate backstories for the other players.That begins with the tragic Fantine (Lily Collins); her daughter Cosette (Ellie Bamber as a teenager), who becomes Val Jean's ward; and Marius (Josh O'Connor), the aristocrat who joins the ill-fated uprising, having grown up in privilege with his grandfather (David Bradley) while being kept apart from his veteran father.Perhaps foremost, the luxury of time allows Davies' treatment to highlight the class disparities and political inequity that are at the heart of Hugo's story, showing the licentious, privileged young men that dally with Fantine and her friends but then run back to Paris, abandoning her with a child and scant means of support.The quality of the casting, meanwhile, extends to relatively modest roles, with Derek Jacobi as the kindly bishop who puts Valjean on his righteous path and Olivia Colman -- fresh off her Oscar win for "The Favourite" -- in costume again as Mrs. Thenardier, who along with her husband (Adeel Akhtar ) know their way around the sewers in more ways than one.Read More
Coachella set times announced:::::(CNN) Plan accordingly for the acts performing this year at the Coachella Valley Music And Arts Festival.That was organizers' message as they released the set times Wednesday via social media.The massive music festival is held annually over two weekends in April in Indio, California.This year Childish Gambino, Tame Impala and Ariana Grande will be headlining.Read More
Oprah Winfrey praises new class of Congresswomen 'forged by fire' in passionate speech:::::(CNN) Oprah has never been more proud to be an American woman.The former queen of daytime talk took the stage as the keynote speaker at Wednesday night's Women in the World Summit at New York City's Lincoln Center and praised the 42 newly elected women of Congress."And when we fulfill that task of actually making ourselves whole we're set up to fully express what we know -- to now negotiate, differentiate, placate, facilitate, demonstrate, and delegate and on a really good day it helps us carve out 20 minutes to actually meditate," Winfrey said during her 12-minute speech."And on a really really good day, like the one we had last January, some of those very skills helped get 42 new women sworn into Congress!If I were a gambler, I sure would bet that these 42 new congresswomen have experience with issues that few congressmen have ever had to face."Winfrey went on to discuss the everyday obstacles that women face in the United States."Let's see, there is the profound and abiding lack of equitable pay, ditto the lack of affordable childcare.There's the distinct possibility of being sexually assaulted in college or raped on a date, there are the bosses who believe that the female anatomy is theirs for the grabbing, there's the shocking abuse of women serving in our military and we could go on and on and be here all night."She added, "But if this sort of nonchalant brutality has wounded our spirit in any way I'm here tonight to say it has also galvanized our determination to live with greater depth, with greater tenacity and backbone.This diverse new generation of congresswomen has been forged by fire, and this is what I know for sure, we are all the better and the sharper for it!"Read More

Ariel Winter says she lost weight because she changed antidepressants:::::(CNN) Changing to a new antidepressant caused Ariel Winter to lose weight, the "Modern Family" actress said.It was several things Winter touched on on Tuesday during an Instagram Stories question-and-answer session."The change in medication instantly made me drop all of the weight I couldn't lose before by just giving me back a metabolism," Winter wrote in response to a submitted question."That was very unexpected."Winter, 21, said she had been on antidepressants for years and had learned to accept the weight gain that was a side effect of the medication.But she grew tired of the "eh" feeling associated with the drug, which she didn't name, so she started the search for something new."So I started the process again and was able to find a great combination of medication that works for me," she wrote.Read More

Elisabeth Moss discusses her Scientology beliefs:::::(CNN) Elisabeth Moss knows that people think her starring role in "The Handmaid's Tale" seems counter to her being a Scientologist.But the actress says it's complicated.In an interview with The Daily Beast, Moss was asked about her belief in Scientology and how that might be seen as "being at odds with the themes" in her hit Hulu drama as well as the show which made her famous, AMC's "Mad Men.""Listen, it's a complicated thing because the things that I believe in, I can only speak to my personal experience and my personal beliefs," she said."One of the things I believe in is freedom of speech.I believe we as humans should be able to critique things."Scientology has long been a controversial religion and has become even more so since former Scientologist and actress Leah Remini launched her popular A&E Network docuseries "Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath."Read More

'Hellboy' rises again, and it's a bloody mess:::::(CNN) "Hellboy" rises again, and without putting too fine a point (or pointed horn) on it, it's a bloody mess.David Harbour slides into the title role, in a movie that contains moments of cheesy, dark humor but which ultimately veers about so unevenly as make sitting through it approximate its hero's subterranean origins.Originally adapted in 2004, the original possessed droll wit in Ron Perlman's snarling performance and considerable visual flair thanks to director Guillermo del Toro.It spawned a sequel, but more than a decade has elapsed since then, with a whole lot of comic-book-inspired movies in between.At first, the latest "Hellboy" seems as if it might be distinguished by a throwback feel, featuring prosthetic makeup --burying the "Strangers Things" star within it -- as opposed to the now-customary reliance on computer graphics.That almost plays like an homage to the bad old days (think "Swamp Thing"), when superhero-horror could still be done on the relative cheap.Before long, though, it becomes painfully clear that the only really new idea this "Hellboy" has to offer is bloodletting and gore, and lots of them, fully embracing an "R" rating.While there's a comical aspect to the gruesomeness in the early going, as is so often the case the approach becomes numbing through repetition, until some of the laughs come in the wrong places.Working from Mike Mignola's comics, director Neil Marshall (a recent veteran of episodic TV) and writer Andrew Cosby set up the villain before getting around to introducing the half-demon hero and his elaborate backstory.Read More
Prince Harry and Oprah are making a show about mental health for Apple:::::London (CNN) Britain's Prince Harry is collaborating with Oprah Winfrey on a new television series tackling the issue of mental health.The multi-part documentary series, which will air on the Apple TV platform in 2020, was co-created and produced by the Duke of Sussex and Winfrey.It aims to inspire viewers to have an "honest conversation about the challenges each of us faces," according to a statement from Kensington Palace.The statement added that the project will attempt to equip people "with the tools to not simply survive, but to thrive."Harry said he was "incredibly proud" to be working alongside Oprah on the "vital" series.
Just a 'Little' black girl magic:::::(CNN) Marsai Martin might want to work a little harder.At least that's the joke her "Little" co-stars Issa Rae and Regina Hall made to CNN when asked why there haven't been more films like theirs, starring young actors of color."Cause she's lazy," Hall teased Martin."One movie and you're 14 already.""'Oh, I just started a production company just now,'" Rae said, pretending to be Martin."I've been busy, I'm sorry," Martin said in a mock exasperated teen voice.Indeed she has.As one of the stars of ABC's hit comedy "Black-ish," Martin already had plenty on her plate.But when she was 13 she strolled into a pitch meeting with Universal Studios to suggest a reboot of the 1988 Tom Hanks hit, "Big," modernized with a black female cast."The pitch meeting was actually pretty smooth," Martin told CNN."I wasn't nervous at all, because I didn't even know what nervous or afraid even meant."The meeting eventually evolved, Martin said, into those gathered sharing memories from their childhoods.The young actress said she went to the "Little" pitch meeting dressed in a blazer to embody her character in the film, Jordan Sanders, the temperamental business woman who wakes up one morning having been thrust back to childhood.Hall portrays Jordan as an adult.The pair said they worked closely together to create continuity for their character."We talked a little bit before we actually started shooting and then we kind of grew with Jordan," Martin said."Regina was on set every single day.She was watching my scenes and I would watch hers to actually get the feel of what Jordan would be like."And while the movie is based on the beloved "Big," Rae, who portrays Jordan's much put upon assistant April Williams, said "Little" stands on its own. "allowfullscreen> "People are going to compare, but we really tried to make our own thing," she said."Little's" director Tina Gordon said body-swapping movies are such a popular genre that she focused more on character development than the fact it's a reboot."I actually just delve deep into the characters and who those women would be, which is what you have to do, breathing life into any piece that you're writing," she said."Those characters are what make the story new."That's where the black girl magic comes in.Not only is the movie about black female characters, conceived of and starring a young, black woman and directed by a black woman, but it also offers black women of all ages the opportunity to see themselves on the big screen.Will Packer produced "Little" and hopes it will create more opportunities for family films told from a black perspective, much like Jordan Peele's success with "Us" is stoking interest in black horror films and "Black Panther" has Hollywood on the lookout for the next big, black superhero movie."I think the world itself is changing, and so now you're going to see films that feel more diverse and more inclusive," Packer said before adding, "Remember we're starting from such a deficit that now that there's more, it doesn't mean that we're anywhere near where we need to be."Martin aims to do her part to get the industry there.She's already made history with "Little" as the youngest person to ever executive produce a major Hollywood film.The teen will star in "StepMonster," a comedy about a young girl trying to navigate life with her stepmother.Rae and Hall joked that they're cast in that film as well and teased their young co-star about a possible "Little" sequel, with Rae lamenting, "Marsai, work harder!"So will there be a "Little" sequel?"We have to figure out how this 'Little' does first before there's a 'Little' sequel," Martin laughed."That's the answer."
'Fosse/Verdon' choreographs FX's latest look at old Hollywood:::::(CNN) If concept and casting are half the battle, "Fosse/Verdon" earns a curtain call before the overture.Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams play director Bob Fosse and star Gwen Verdon, whose tumultuous relationship and partnership provides another delicious window into what amounts to an FX niche chronicling the big personalities of old Hollywood.The allure of the subject matter is surely helpful, since this handsomely produced eight-part series -- which counts Lin-Manuel Miranda and daughter Nicole Fosse among its many producers -- gets off to a slow start, choreographing the story out of sequence, in a manner that's initially as disorienting as some of those scenes in "All That Jazz."Stick with it, though, and this limited series provides not only a fascinating snapshot of its time but of the unique qualities of the central duo's relationship, with Fosse wooing Verdon, cheating on her and divorcing her, but never losing his reliance upon her as a creative muse and confidant.The depth of that interaction proves vital, since Fosse alone represents a virtual clich in terms of a tortured artist -- someone who can't sit through the premiere of "Cabaret," his breakthrough film, muttering, "All I see is the s**t I should have fixed."Through quick-cut flashbacks, there are glimpses of Fosse as a performer, someone who dreamed of becoming Fred Astaire.He instead became a choreographer and director, meeting Verdon while devising her routines for "Damn Yankees," after she won her first Tony Award.Read More
'Avengers: Endgame' may mean the end for some Marvel characters:::::(CNN) For Marvel Studios, all roads have led to "Avengers: Endgame."More than a decade and 21 films in the making, the fourth Avengers film finally arrives in theaters this month with almost impossibly high expectations -- both for audiences and the box office.In the build up we've accumulated dozens of characters in the ever-sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe.However, after the events of "Avengers: Infinity War" -- which saw the Mad Titan Thanos wipe out half of all sentient life with the snap of his fingers -- their numbers are heavily depleted.For the sake of the franchise it won't stay that way, but "Endgame" has to live up to its high-stakes billing.This writer isn't out for blood, but deaths are all but guaranteed.So who lives, who dies and who's coming back from the snap?Buckle up, because there's a lot to cover -- from what's happening both on and off screen.Here's a non-exhaustive (but still exhausting) run down of our heroes' chances.Note: This list includes spoilers up to and including "Captain Marvel.""Avengers: Endgame" had not been screened to the press at the time of writing and the blinkers are firmly on regarding set leaks and other online hearsay.Ant-Man Current status: Alive Is Scott Lang going to be the secret sauce in the fight against Thanos?We've never really taken Ant-Man seriously (lord knows he doesn't do so himself), but "Ant-Man and the Wasp's" exploration of the Quantum Realm and its time-bending properties might be the way to travel back pre-snap without the Time Stone.Added incentive for Lang to pull his finger out: the snap wiped out the Wasp, mentor Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne (the original Ant-Man and Wasp).Dead or alive?Paul Rudd's character is a relatively new entry into the MCU.Not a dead cert, but he'll likely survive.Black Panther Current status: Dead Do you really think Marvel is about to drop the superhero behind an Oscar-winning, $1.3 billion-grossing film after one solo outing?Kevin Feige announced "Black Panther 2" was happening back in March 2018 Dead or alive?Wakanda forever!Black Widow Current status: Alive Black Widow was the Avenger that never got the standalone film they deserved (sorry Hawkeye).That finally changed in 2018 when it was announced that Natasha Romanoff would receive a solo outing, with subsequent reporting that Florence Pugh has joined the cast alongside Johansson.Whether it will be an origin story or post-"Endgame" is still unconfirmed.Dead or alive?Killing off your lead before their first solo film would be an odd move, but if the "Black Widow" movie is a prequel that would leave Johansson open to explore other projects afterward and have the last say in what has been a decade-long injustice.I'm leaning toward death.Bruce Banner/The Hulk Current status: Alive When we left Banner in Wakanda he was having a real Hulk impotence problem -- kind of inconvenient for everyone.Banner/Hulk has been invaluable to the Avengers, but as a character he's often worked as a foil within the group.With no solo outing under Marvel Studios announced, and the likelihood a number of his comrades will die in "Endgame," you might think this is the end of the road for Banner.But Mark Ruffalo still has films outstanding on a six-movie deal he signed back in 2012.Dead or alive?Going to survive -- and hopefully continue the intergalactic buddy road trip with Thor.Bucky Barnes Current status: Dead Expect Barnes' death in "Infinity War" to be a motivator behind a self-sacrificing play from old friend Captain America in "Endgame" (whatever shape that might take).Barnes could well pick up the vibranium shield and become the new Cap' post-"Endgame," following a plot line from the comics.(Huge hint: Sebastian Stan is reportedly locked in to a nine-film contract .)There's also the mooted Disney+ series with Falcon.Stan has also expressed an interest in the "Black Widow" film.He'll be busy if that all comes to pass.Dead or alive?Alive -- and possibly with a few personality tweaks if he's to take up the shield.Captain America Current status: Alive Steve Rogers came back from the wilderness in "Infinity War," bearded and bad-ass.Now Captain America looks ready to lay down everything in "Endgame."Chris Evans has dropped anvil-sized hints in interviews for over a year and seems to have already said goodbye to the character on Twitter .It feels like a done deal.Dead or alive?The all-American hero is a goner.We'll miss you Cap'.Captain Marvel Current status: Alive "Captain Marvel" just cruised past the billion-dollar club at the global box office and Brie Larson's take on spacefaring pilot Carol Danvers was a critical success too."Endgame" is only the beginning, and there's murmurs she could eventually head up the Avengers.We've only just started to see what she's capable off.Dead or alive?You come at the queen, you best not miss.She lives.Doctor Strange Current status: Dead Before falling victim to the snap, Strange told Tony Stark this was the only way; he had looked into multiple futures and seen doom in every other permutation.Being the raging narcissist that he is, don't expect any self-sacrificing moves from Strange, who only made his debut in 2016.There's also the small matter of a standalone sequel reportedly in development Dead or alive?The good doctor will return.Drax the Destroyer Current status: Dead David Bautista led the "Guardians" actors in their vocal support of James Gunn after his firing.Gunn is back at the helm , and expect Drax to survive "Endgame" and feature prominently in "Guardians 3."Trivia: It's not going to happen in the Marvel Studios' PG-13 universe, but in one story from the comics Drax defeats Thanos by ripping out his heart.Dead or alive?Alive.His reflexes are too fast.Falcon Current status: Dead The Disney+ series with Bucky all but guarantees he'll be back from the dead and make it through "Endgame."Dead or alive?The second string Avenger lives.Gamora Current status: Dead Gamora's demise was a tough watch.Sacrificed by Thanos to gain the Soul Stone, if you didn't realize already, here was proof that absolute power corrupts absolutely.Killed pre-snap, but "Endgame" marketing art keeps her in the frame, suggests she can still be brought back to life.Dead or alive?If anyone deserves to survive "Endgame" it's probably Thanos' long-suffering adopted daughter.Alive.Groot Current status: Dead Big call, but no character is more beloved in the MCU.Groot already sacrificed himself once at the end of "Guardians of the Galaxy" and is only just returning to his normal size.No way they'd off him permanently.Dead or alive?Alive.There'd be riots outside Marvel HQ.Happy Hogan Current status: Alive The fate of Happy's employer Tony Stark is very much in the air (more of which later).If he does die, Stark's long-suffering friend and chauffeur would appear surplus to requirements.But he's right there in the "Spider-Man: Far From Home" trailer, which arrives in theaters in July and, according to comments from producer Amy Pascal back in 2017, starts " a few minutes after Avengers 4 wraps ."Dead or alive?Alive.Hawkeye Current status: Alive Absent in "Infinity War" because he was under house arrest (a lame excuse in my book), Hawkeye returned in the "Endgame" trailer with an outr haircut and world-weary scowl.What he's been up to is anyone's guess, but after two Avengers films in the shadow of bigger superheroes, will Hawkeye finally have his moment in the sun?Yeah, that could pretty underwhelming.Dead or alive?This smells like a redemption narrative -- I suspect Hawkeye's family might not have survived the snap.Given there's not many other places for the character to go, he could easily bite the dust.Iron Man Current status: Alive Tony Stark's first outing in 2008 was the cornerstone on which this entire cinematic universe was built.If that sounds like a eulogy, that's because it's supposed to.Robert Downey Jr. is out of contract after "Endgame" and let's face it, there's no shortage of wise-cracking egotists in the MCU ready to carry the torch.Will Stark really be able to just walk away from all of this unscathed?Dead or alive?If it happens it will be glorious, tragic and (hopefully) delivered with a wry smile.But he's a prime contender to die.Loki Current status: Dead An early victim in "Infinity War," Loki never made it past the intro, never mind the snap.Intriguingly, one of the Disney+ series in development focuses on the loveable antihero from Asgard -- with Tom Hiddleston to star, Disney have confirmed .What Disney hasn't confirmed is when it will be set.Marvel offered no comment to The Hollywood Reporter when sources suggested the series would have Loki popping up through human history like a god-level Forrest Gump.So it sounds like a prequel.Dead or alive?The master of cheating death could feasibly do it again, but the signs say he's a goner.Mantis Current status: Dead A latecomer to the Guardians clique, Mantis bit the dust in "Infinity War."But there's no good reason for her to stay dead.Fingers crossed we get plenty more laughs from this intergalactic oddball in "Guardians 3."Dead or alive?Death would be a senseless move.Mantis should live.M'Baku Current status: Alive Could M'Baku become king of Wakanda with T'Challa out of the equation?It's possible.M'Baku hasn't featured in any "Endgame" trailers, but Winston Duke has confirmed he's returning .It seems unlikely Marvel will kill off the affable vegetarian, especially given the "Us" star's ever-rising profile.Dead or alive?Alive.Nebula Current status: Alive Thanos' adopted daughter could make a big play in "Endgame."Marvel aficionados will know that in one plot from the comics , Nebula managed to seize the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos and used it to undo his murders.She then went on a power trip and had to be stopped and imprisoned.We don't know if any of this will happen in "Endgame," but if some of it does, Nebula could end up as collateral in restoring order to the universe.That said, there's rumors a Gamora and Nebula series is in early development for Disney+, and Karen Gillan has talked about "Guardians 3" as if she's involved.Dead or alive?On the basis of her "Guardians 3" hints she'll make it.But there's a huge case for her dying in "Endgame" otherwise.Nick Fury Current status: Dead Fury set the wheels of "Endgame" in motion when he dropped Captain Marvel a message on his pager mid-disintegration.He's been through the wringer, but every time Fury has come out swinging.So don't expect the small matter of Thanos and the destruction of half the universe to spell his end.Dead or alive?Alive.He's in the "Spider-Man: Far From Home" trailer.Okoye Current status: Alive No one had Black Panther's back more than Okoye.Expect her to return with vengeance in "Endgame" to try and bring T'Challa back from the dead.No word on whether Danai Gurira is confirmed to reprise the role in "Black Panther 2," but killing Okoye in "Endgame" would come as a shock.Dead or alive?More alive than dead.Pepper Potts Current status: Alive Eagle-eyed viewers of the "Spider-Man: Far From Home" trailer will have spotted a giant check from Stark Industries signed by Pepper Potts.I'm not sure how long it takes for one of those to get printed, but remarkably Potts might outlive her maverick boss-turned-partner.Dead or alive?With Tony Stark probably heading for the exit, is the MCU going to see its first conscious uncoupling?Pass me a Goop-branded hanky.Rocket Current status: Alive A tougher call than it should be.Rocket has had quite the character arc since he was first introduced in "Guardians of the Galaxy," and a self-sacrificing move -- especially when it comes to Groot -- wouldn't be out of the question.But there's no way they'll leave Groot without his translator, right?Dead or alive?Alive and quipping.Scarlet Witch Current status: Dead Snapped after watching Vision die twice over, but reportedly returning in Disney+ series " The Vision and Scarlet Witch ".So this shouldn't be the end of the road for Wanda Maximoff.Dead or alive?Alive.Shuri Current status: Dead The internet was shocked when Marvel released marketing art suggesting Shuri was victim of the snap -- it was the first we'd heard of it.An off-camera death is short shrift for a character that stole nearly every "Black Panther" scene she was in.Don't expect her to stay out of the picture.Dead or alive?T'Challa wouldn't last two minutes without his little sister.She's going to pull through.Spider-Man Current status: Dead Tom Holland delivered a gut punch of a death scene in "Infinity War," with Peter Parker watched over by helpless mentor Iron Man.Expect Parker's resurrection to be a prime motivator for Stark.Dead or alive?Not a chance.Unless Sony and Marvel Studios have played us all and "Far From Home" is in fact a prequel, flying in the face of all previous reporting.Star-Lord Current status: Dead When the third installment of "Guardians of the Galaxy" was in the doldrums there was a question mark hanging over the fate of Peter Quill/Star-Lord, but not any more.The Guardians need their leading man.Dead or alive?He'll make the cut, you big turd blossoms.The Ancient One Current status: Dead Died in "Doctor Strange," but Tilda Swinton is reportedly among the cast of "Endgame."Expect the Ancient One to feature in some form of flashback or time travel to impart some wisdom, but not to stick around beyond "Endgame" -- she'd just get in the way of Strange in future films.Dead or alive?Dead.Thor Current status: Alive Arguably "Infinity War's" MVP, Thor levelled-up his weaponry and so nearly killed Thanos.Chris Hemsworth has said he's out of contract after "Endgame," but after the roaring success of Thor's last solo outing "Ragnarok," it doesn't feel like the Norse god has run his course.Dead or alive?Strong chance Thor lives.Valkyrie Current status: Alive Critics agreed that Tessa Thompson knocked it out the park as warrior drunk Valkyrie in "Ragnarok," and there's plenty of room for this character to grow.Marvel Studios know an asset when they see one.Dead or alive?Only just beginning to spread her wings.She lives.Vision Current status: Dead Whatever lies beyond the mortal plane, Vision still probably has a killer migraine after Thanos ripped the Mind Stone from his forehead.His story arc has arguably run its course, but an upcoming Disney+ series alongside Scarlet Witch would likely make him indispensable.Dead or alive?Probably going to survive, proving you can never keep a part-android, part-space gem down.War Machine Current status: Alive James Rhodes survived the snap, but as a long-term vet of the MCU and with associates likely to die in "Endgmae," the next chapter for the colonel is murky.Dead or alive?This could go either way.Assuming Stark dies, donning the Iron Man suit wouldn't be a big leap for War Machine.On the other hand, with no Tony Stark to keep in check, Rhodes loses some of his raison d'etre.But paralyzing him, fixing him with robotic legs, only to kill him would be a cold, cold move.Wasp Current status: Dead Killed by the snap that brought the end of "Ant-Man and the Wasp" in line with "Infinity War," Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne has only had two outings in the Marvel films.Lilly's badinage with Paul Rudd's Steve Lang was one of the best things about the Ant-Man sequel, and there's no reason why that need come to an end -- unless to lend emotional heft to as-yet-unannounced "Ant-Man 3."Dead or alive?Likely to survive, but not a lock.Wong Current status: Alive Not a huge presence in "Infinity War" (someone has to protect the Sanctum Sanctorum), Wong will likely be thrust into the action in "Endgame," especially given his knowledge of the mystic arts.Dead or alive?Doctor Strange is going to need a friend in his next standalone, and their budding bromance has room to grow.He lives.Bonus: Thanos Current status: Alive The Mad Titan's victory at the end of the last chapter wasn't surprising, but the manner of it shocked audiences.It also prompted a deluge of think pieces asking if, in an epoch of unsustainable resource consumption, he was really the villain after all.But while Thanos won the battle for the universe, he's never going to win the war.That's just not how superhero movies work.Dead or alive?He should enjoy his retirement while he still can.Definitely dying."Avengers: Endgame" arrives in cinemas in international territories beginning April 24 and in the US April 26.
'Killing Eve' plunges back in right where it left off:::::(CNN) Picking up almost immediately where its much-ballyhooed first season concluded, "Killing Eve" deftly continues the cat-and-mouse game that made this BBC America series one of 2018's most pleasant surprises -- an espionage caper loaded with dry wit, dark comedy and two splendid central performances.That would be Sandra Oh, who picked up a Golden Globe for season one, as the MI6 analyst Eve Polastri; and Jodie Comer as Villanelle, the shadowy assassin who Eve rather abruptly stabbed at the end of season one.Still, it's going to take a lot more than that to stop Villanelle, whose flight -- in her wounded state dominates the early episodes -- while Eve tries to sort out just exactly who she can trust, in a world that's more dangerous than the office-bound life to which she had been accustomed.Created by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who is having quite a moment as an actress (she stars in her other series, "Fleabag") and creative force, "Killing Eve" features some genuinely shocking moments, thanks largely to Villanelle's mercurial nature.Because you're never quite sure what she'll do -- and how far she'll go -- the show has a genuine sense of menace, mixed with the disarming humor that comes from Villanelle rolling her eyes and throwing tantrums like a pouty teenager.Eve describes her quarry as being "flamboyant and attention-seeking," not usually qualities one sees in this line of work.Yet that's precisely what gives "Killing Eve" its freshness, and connected well enough with viewers that the show has been promoted to air both on BBC America and its bigger sister network AMC.The latter could certainly use a hit, and might have found one, improbably, with this hitwoman, for however long Waller-Bridge and company can tease out a dynamic that's delicious, yes, but difficult to sustain.Read More

Raising Hell: Film Stars Talk About Bringing 'Hellboy' Back To the Silver Screen:::::'Hellboy' creator Mike Mignola, David Harbour, Sasha Lane and Milla Jovovich talk about the process of recreating the comic for the big screen.(Published Friday, April 5, 2019) The stars of the upcoming fantasy/superhero flick "Hellboy" took to the red carpet in New York Tuesday for a special screening of the film.The popular Mike Mignola comic book series has been reimagined for the big screen once again, 25 years after its debut issue was published.The R-rated horror action-fantasy film stars David Harbour as Hellboy, the half-demon superhero and Milla Jovovich as Nimue the Blood Queen, a resurrected ancient sorceress hell-bent on revenge.Daniel Dae Kim (Major Ben Daimio), Douglas Tait (Gruagach, a hog-like fairy creature), and screenwriter Andrew Cosby were among the attendees at the Lincoln Square theater in New York City for the red carpet premiere.Harbour, who many fans know from his role on the Netflix hit "Stranger Things," professed his love for the "Hellboy" comics since his early twenties.In a speech before the screening, Harbour thanked Mignola for his "true genius," without which "none of us would be here."Harbour also spoke about his unconventional methods for preparing for the role, including improv and musical theater classes in Los Angeles.Some of his improv even made it into the movie.He also thanked Joel Harlowe, the special character and makeup designer."The brilliant Joel Harlowe applied KY jelly all over my body at three in the morning every Monday morning.So you're welcome Joel," Harbour said.Harbour shared the one thing he wants fans to know about this take on the franchise."We are going to the source material and we are pulling a lot directly from the Dark Horse comics.The color palette is a lot darker and also it's really more of a horror-y sort of almost heavy metal movie in a certain way," Harbour said.How dark is the film?Well, Hellboy must choose between saving the humans that have always rejected him or joining Nimue in triggering the apocalypse.Douglas Tait, who both acts and serves as a stuntman in the film, believes "Hellboy" stands apart from other traditional comic book heroes in a significant way."A lot of the other superheroes are loved by everyone and he's actually hated even though he's doing good," Tait said."He's discriminated against because of the way he looks and where he comes from.And he's got this dry sense of humor that's so different from any of the other comic heroes."Screenwriter Andrew Cosby was a huge fan of the comic series long before getting to work with creator Mike Mignola himself."Half the working relationship was just oohing and aahing over getting to work with someone I consider to be a master of his craft.""He let me explore the character in my own ways, but at the same time was always there as a bit of a safety net to make sure I didn't go too far," Cosby said."And there were plenty of times where I'd be like, 'Hey Mike, would Hellboy say this?'or 'Would Hellboy do that?'Having that when you're making a movie is priceless."Cosby's first iteration of the script was in 2015, but he feels the film came together pretty quickly.For fans of the previous "Hellboy" film by Guillermo Del Toro, Cosby says fans shouldn't feel that they have to forget about that film to love this one."I was a huge fan of the Guillermo movie and that's part of my love for the character.I think the guy is beyond a genius," Cosby said."And so I would just say to come watch this movie because it's something different and it's more.It's more of the thing you already love.It may not be exactly what you want to see or what you thought you were going to see, but I guarantee you, you're going to have a good time and you're going to love what you watch.""Enjoy the crazy fun, horror romp, monster superhero extravaganza that is 'Hellboy,'" Harbour said."Hellboy" hits theaters on Friday, April 12.

'This Is Us' Star Susan Kelechi Watson Honored at NYU Tisch Event:::::Susan Kelechi Watson talks about the new season of "This Is Us," the text messages she exchanges with family over the show and her new movie, "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood."(Published Tuesday, April 2, 2019) The exposed brick walls at St. Anns Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York, were adorned with warm string lights, Imagine the Future" signs and multicolor neon square panels reminiscent of a '70s disco floor.The performing arts venue located below the Brooklyn Bridge was filled with New York University faculty, alumni and student performers who had gathered to honor some of the institutions best and brightest.Yet even during an event celebrating her work and influence, This Is Us star Susan Kelechi Watson used her spotlight to educate the audience about the importance of acting and to inspire aspiring actors with her wisdom.As a member of the "This Is Us" ensemble, Watson has shined the last several years as part of the award-winning cast.But Monday night the spotlight was firmly on her alone.Watson, who stars as Beth Pearson on the NBC hit was honored for her work mentoring upcoming actors, directors and producers at New York Universitys Tisch School of the Arts annual gala Monday night.The event also honored alum Sharon Chang, who has worked on everything from documentary films to investment projects.Filmmaker Martin Scorsese and Alec and Hilaria Baldwin served as co-chairs.Former Columbia Records president Clive Davis, after whom one of NYU Tischs programs is named, was also in attendance.After completing her undergraduate studies at Howard University, Watson attended NYU Tischs Graduate Acting Program.Along with performing on NBCs Blacklist and HBOs Divorce, she also mentors incarcerated youth through New York Citys Drama Club an acts as a youth mentor for Epic Theatre Ensembles Epic NEXT program.On the red carpet, Watson said it was really amazing to be honored by her alma mater.She said she first realized the importance of the recognition after returning to the university when two of her friends were honored.Even in that moment, I knew how special it was to come back to be honored by a school that gave us so much," Watson said."The skill set I have now as an actress, so much of those tools came from studying here.During the gala, as actress Phylicia Rashad, who guest-stars on This Is Us as the mother of Watsons character, ascended the stage to introduce Watson.Rashad first met Watson when she began teaching classes at Howard University for a semester.Rashad said that although Watson was initially quiet and shy, she never failed to ask the important questions.In this Monday, April 8, 2019, photo, Susan Kelechi Watson poses with Phylicia Rashad at New York University's Tisch Gala 2019 at St. Ann's Warehouse in New York.Photo credit: Sam Hollenshead She is courageous, she is daring, and she has a really strong commitment to humanity, Rashad said.Shes witty.Shes oh-so-funny.And resourceful.Rashad also noted that playing Watsons mother was very challenging because of the awe with which she sees Watson.There is nothing more gratifying to a teacher or one who imagines oneself a teacher than to see the student arise and attain levels of mastery one after the other and she is that.For Watson, the sense of awe was mutual.If there was no Clair Huxtable, there'd be no Beth Pearson in the same way, that if there was no Claudette Watson, thered be no Susan Watson, Watson said, referring to her mother who was among the attendees.If you knew the depths of who she is as a person, if you knew what she poured into me throughout my life, you would understand why the characters I play are strong women, why the characters I play are women who can face adversity, challenge and triumph.In this Monday, April 8, 2019, photo, Susan Kelechi Watson sits with her family at New York University's Tisch Gala 2019 at St. Ann's

Raising Hell: Film Stars Talk About Bringing 'Hellboy' Back To the Silver Screen:::::'Hellboy' creator Mike Mignola, David Harbour, Sasha Lane and Milla Jovovich talk about the process of recreating the comic for the big screen.(Published Friday, April 5, 2019) The stars of the upcoming fantasy/superhero flick "Hellboy" took to the red carpet in New York Tuesday for a special screening of the film.The popular Mike Mignola comic book series has been reimagined for the big screen once again, 25 years after its debut issue was published.The R-rated horror action-fantasy film stars David Harbour as Hellboy, the half-demon superhero and Milla Jovovich as Nimue the Blood Queen, a resurrected ancient sorceress hell-bent on revenge.Daniel Dae Kim (Major Ben Daimio), Douglas Tait (Gruagach, a hog-like fairy creature), and screenwriter Andrew Cosby were among the attendees at the Lincoln Square theater in New York City for the red carpet premiere.Harbour, who many fans know from his role on the Netflix hit "Stranger Things," professed his love for the "Hellboy" comics since his early twenties.In a speech before the screening, Harbour thanked Mignola for his "true genius," without which "none of us would be here."Harbour also spoke about his unconventional methods for preparing for the role, including improv and musical theater classes in Los Angeles.Some of his improv even made it into the movie.He also thanked Joel Harlowe, the special character and makeup designer."The brilliant Joel Harlowe applied KY jelly all over my body at three in the morning every Monday morning.So you're welcome Joel," Harbour said.Harbour shared the one thing he wants fans to know about this take on the franchise."We are going to the source material and we are pulling a lot directly from the Dark Horse comics.The color palette is a lot darker and also it's really more of a horror-y sort of almost heavy metal movie in a certain way," Harbour said.How dark is the film?Well, Hellboy must choose between saving the humans that have always rejected him or joining Nimue in triggering the apocalypse.Douglas Tait, who both acts and serves as a stuntman in the film, believes "Hellboy" stands apart from other traditional comic book heroes in a significant way."A lot of the other superheroes are loved by everyone and he's actually hated even though he's doing good," Tait said."He's discriminated against because of the way he looks and where he comes from.And he's got this dry sense of humor that's so different from any of the other comic heroes."Screenwriter Andrew Cosby was a huge fan of the comic series long before getting to work with creator Mike Mignola himself."Half the working relationship was just oohing and aahing over getting to work with someone I consider to be a master of his craft.""He let me explore the character in my own ways, but at the same time was always there as a bit of a safety net to make sure I didn't go too far," Cosby said."And there were plenty of times where I'd be like, 'Hey Mike, would Hellboy say this?'or 'Would Hellboy do that?'Having that when you're making a movie is priceless."Cosby's first iteration of the script was in 2015, but he feels the film came together pretty quickly.For fans of the previous "Hellboy" film by Guillermo Del Toro, Cosby says fans shouldn't feel that they have to forget about that film to love this one."I was a huge fan of the Guillermo movie and that's part of my love for the character.I think the guy is beyond a genius," Cosby said."And so I would just say to come watch this movie because it's something different and it's more.It's more of the thing you already love.It may not be exactly what you want to see or what you thought you were going to see, but I guarantee you, you're going to have a good time and you're going to love what you watch.""Enjoy the crazy fun, horror romp, monster superhero extravaganza that is 'Hellboy,'" Harbour said."Hellboy" hits theaters on Friday, April 12.

Ray, wrote that "some of the best minds from the corporate world" participated in the meeting, the large majority of them people of color."They made great demands," Dapper Dan wrote."It's time for Gucci to answer.That is supposed to happen today."He said he would announce a town hall meeting in Harlem to talk about how the community feels about Gucci's proposals once those proposals have been received.It wasn't clear who else was in attendance at Friday's meeting; Dapper Dan said in a post Sunday that Gucci's CEO had agreed to fly from Italy to Harlem this week to discuss the matter with community and industry leaders.Cyrus Stuns in Never-Before-Seen Photos From Her Wedding Day Miley Cyrus can't stop thinking about her wedding!In honor of Valentine's Day, the "Rainbowland" singer shared a handful of never-before-seen photos from her big day, including a silly photo with her groom, Liam Hemsworth.Take a peek into Miley's celebration.(Published Friday, Feb. 15, 2019) "There is no excuse nor apology that can erase this kind of insult," he wrote in that Sunday post."There cannot be inclusivity without accountability."Gucci has apologized for the turtleneck black wool balaclava-style sweater, which covered the nose and included a red cut-out for the mouth.The fashion house pulled it from online and physical stores, saying in a statement it was committed to diversity and considered it a "fundamental value to be fully upheld, respected and at the forefront of every decision we make."Earlier this week, Gucci's creative director broke his silence on the matter, saying racism was never his intention.Alessandro Michele, a design force at the Italian fashion house, lamented in a letter to employees both his own pain and "that of the people who saw in one of my creative projects an intolerable insult."Michele wrote the sweater was not inspired by blackface but by the late Leigh Bowery, a performance artist, club promoter and fashion designer who often used flamboyant face makeup and costumes.Nonetheless, he said he took "full accountability" for the sweater.Dapper Dan has had previous qualms with the brand which appeared to copy one of his designs in 2017, but more recently partnered with the fashion house to open the Gucci Dapper Dan Atelier Studio, an homage to his original Dapper Dan Boutique in Harlem.Fitness Star Lewin Bitten by Wild Pig During Photo Shoot

Back To Life: Episodes' Daisy Haggard on playing a 'relentless optimist':::::Image caption Daisy Haggard wrote Back To Life and plays the lead role of Miri Matteson You might not recognise Daisy Haggard by name but you probably know her face.As Myra Licht in BBC Two's Episodes, Haggard gurned her way through a series of frequently hilarious expressions, stealing every scene she was in.In Back To Life, the new BBC comedy-drama that she both wrote and stars in, her face is frequently in close-up.Often, Haggard doesn't need words to let you know exactly what her character is thinking.It's a quality her Back To Life co-star, Bafta-winning actor Adeel Akhtar, admires.Asked to name his favourite moment during filming, the Four Lions and Les Miserables actor immediately responds: "I really liked watching her (Haggard) do her stuff.There are moments where it's like, comedy, comedy, comedy and super funny and the comedy catches you in a way that you're surprised that you're gonna laugh."And there's bits in there where she really moves you, there's bits where it's proper acting and I was massively surprised."Haggard interjects with a jokey question: "Because she's so c**p in everything else?!She's the one that does the face in Episodes!"Akhtar laughs: "Yeah!She had five different faces in one scene."Image copyright BBC/Hat Trick Productions/Showtime Networks/Des Wi Image caption Haggard (facing) as Myra Licht in Episodes with Joseph May Trials of freedom In Back To Life, Haggard's facial expressions deftly switch between comedy and tragedy as the material requires.As the first episode begins, her character Miri Matteson has just returned home after serving an 18-year jail sentence.The audience is initially kept guessing about why Miri was locked up but graffiti outside her home suggests she did something very bad.Haggard says public attitudes to women who commit crimes fascinate her: "I was always really interested in how harshly we judge a woman who has done a bad thing over how we judge men."We put things that men do sometimes down to testosterone.We forgive them a little easier."I wanted to write a show about a woman who had done something in her past and what that would be like, to try and start your life again with that enormous dark secret and baggage behind you."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Watch Miri (Daisy Haggard) attempt a job interview While developing the show, Haggard spoke to some former prisoners who had moved back into their family homes, just as Miri does: "I thought it was so fascinating because in some situations, you know, you have to register at the GP, you haven't got a note to say where you live, you haven't been on a date, you don't know how to interact."You've had this extraordinary, massive, enormous experience but you haven't actually had some quite fundamental, day-to-day life experiences and I thought that was just a really interesting story."Haggard and her Perrier-award winning co-writer Laura Solon find a dark humour in Miri's struggles to pick up her life after 18 years.An early scene where Miri returns home to find her bedroom plastered with posters of stars like David Bowie, George Michael and Prince, who all passed away while she served her sentence, encapsulates the tone of the first episode.The new Fleabag?Image caption The series follows Miri in her first few weeks out of prison Though they are very different characters, Haggard's Miri has something in common with Phoebe Waller-Bridge's Fleabag, as both shows feature complex female leads, struggling to put their past behind them.Back To Life also attracted the producers of that award-winning show and will be shown in Fleabag's slot on BBC One from 15 April.Haggard, however, is keen to steer away from comparisons.She says: "Our voices are so different that I never wilfully felt I had to do anything to make it (Back To Life) feel different."Phoebe is a genius and I love that show so much and I am so happy that she's doing what she's doing for women."I think it's fantastic but also my voice is a different voice and so I didn't consciously do anything because it was just a very different story in my mind."Mending fences Image copyright BBC/Des Willie Image caption Adeel Akhtar won a TV Bafta for his work on the BBC Three drama Murdered by My Father As Miri attempts to rebuild her life, she forms a friendship with Akhtar's character, Billy.He says: "I play a character called Billy who lives next door to Miri and he's a gardener and they meet each other over a fence, and that's a detail which I think is important."Certainly, Miri spends much of the first episode trying to mend fences within her community, attempting to find a job and reconnect with her teenage sweetheart Dom (Game of Thrones' Jamie Michie).Despite the clues that leave viewers with an uneasy sense that Miri has, at one point, done something horrific, the writing and Haggard's nuanced performance mean you can't help but be on her side.Image caption Miri's parents Caroline (Geraldine James) and Oscar (Richard Durden) try to help her adapt to life outside Haggard says: "Miri is a relentless optimist.She's very determined."She's determined to start her life and to try to have a life despite what's happened.In the end you're left judging the woman for who she is now, hopefully, and not for her actions in the past."Akhtar, who made Bafta TV history for being the first non-white best actor winner in the awards' 62-year history, says working on the show was a rewarding experience: "It was like no other job.I felt free to do whatever I wanted to do at the same time as being guided by this really amazing script."You didn't want to go too far from what was written anyway, so it was just a perfect combination of so many things that I can't list for you right now.It was perfect, yeah."All episodes of Back To Life begin streaming on BBC Three on 15 April, or you can watch it weekly on BBC One.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk,

Jussie Smollett sued by City of Chicago:::::Image copyright Getty Images The City of Chicago has filed a lawsuit against Jussie Smollett, seeking three times the damages it said it ran up while investigating the actor.Prosecutors say Smollett staged a homophobic and racist attack to boost his career, but the 36-year-old has always maintained his innocence.Charges against him were dropped after Smollett forfeited a $10,000 (7,600) bond payment and did community service.The exact amount prosecutors want Smollett to pay was not revealed.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jussie Smollett: An assault or a fake?After charges were dropped against Empire actor Jussie Smollett, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel said that he had been given special treatment because of his celebrity status.And President Donald Trump described the case as an "embarrassment to America".Smollett was given seven days by the City of Chicago to pay $130,000 (99,000) to cover the investigation's cost - but threatened to sue when the deadline passed.Smollett claimed that a rope was put around his neck and an unknown substance splashed on his face by two men using pro-Donald Trump slogans.Obabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, two brothers, were at one point believed to have carried out the attack after instructions by Smollett.They had appeared as extras on Empire and had trained with Smollett in the gym.Security footage taken on the night of the incident showed them buying items such as a ski mask and a red cap.They are yet to give their account of what happened that night and have not commented on their arrest and interview in connection with the case.A new Mayor of Chicago, Lori Lightfoot, will be sworn in on 20 May.She said there needs to be a "much more fulsome explanation" as to why the charges against Smollett were dropped."We cannot create the perception that if you're rich or famous or both that you get one set of justice, and for everybody else it's something much harsher," she said.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.
Stillbirth documentary firm fined for maternity unit filming:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cambridge maternity patients criticised filming at the unit A television company has been fined 120,000 for unlawfully filming expectant mothers in a maternity unit.True Vision Productions (TVP) set up CCTV-style cameras in the Rosie Birth Centre at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, for a Channel 4 documentary on stillbirths in 2017.Although notices were posted in the unit, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) concluded TVP "failed to adequately inform patients".The recorded footage was later deleted.ICO director of investigations Steve Eckersley said: "Patients would not have expected to have been filmed in this situation, and many will have been very distressed when they learned such a private and potentially traumatic moment had been recorded."Image caption Filming took place at the maternity unit in Cambridge TVP set up microphones and cameras in the unit's walk-in clinic between July and September 2017.The hospital trust had given permission and TVP "had posted limited notices advising of the filming near to the cameras and in the waiting room area and had left letters on waiting room tables," the ICO said."The detailed investigation found that these letters did not provide adequate explanations to patients, with one notice incorrectly stating that mums and visitors would not be filmed without permission," it added.Filming was halted after the BBC reported on concerns expressed by some expectant mothers.It resumed using different methods and the documentary was broadcast in October 2018.'Anxiety and stress' "The unlawfully obtained footage was not broadcast and was deleted," the ICO said.It added the original footage "would have included the sensitive personal data of patients who could already be suffering anxiety and stress".Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust said it had agreed to participate as patients said more needed to be done to raise awareness of issues surrounding stillbirth.A spokesman added: "While protocols were in place to protect privacy, we acknowledge the ICO decision and we are sorry for any distress caused."TVP, which is based in London, said it was "disappointed in the outcome" and had made "strong legal representations" that the ICO's approach was wrong.It added: "We are considering the decision and the potential for an appeal with our legal advisors."
Shila Iqbal: Emmerdale actress fired over old tweets:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Shila Iqbal briefly played Aiesha Richards Actress Shila Iqbal has been fired from Emmerdale over historical offensive tweets, ITV has confirmed.The star, who played Aiesha Richards on the soap, was only made a series regular at the end of March.She said she was "terribly sorry" for using "inappropriate language" in tweets sent in 2013, when she was 19."As a consequence of historic social media posts, Shila Iqbal has left her role as Aiesha Richards on Emmerdale," a spokesperson for the show said."The programme took the decision not to renew her contract as soon as these posts were brought to the company's attention."ITV would not confirm what she had said in the messages, and the 24-year-old has deleted her Twitter account.'Completely wrong' In a statement, she said: "I am terribly sorry and take full responsibility for my use of such inappropriate language.I have paid the price and can no longer continue the job I loved the most at Emmerdale."Although I was young when I made the tweets, it was still completely wrong of me to do so and I sincerely apologise."She added: "The only consideration I would ask is that I have recently received hateful tweets telling me that as a Muslim my Emmerdale role means that I am 'committing sinful acts, promoting sin and deliberately going against the Quran'."We live in sensitive times for members of all communities and especially those in multi-racial Rochdale, where I grew up.I regret that I too have let people down by the use of such language, albeit six years ago."I, like everyone else, have a responsibility about the language I have used on social media as well as in conversation."She's the latest in a string of high-profile figures to find old tweets coming back to haunt them.Last month, an actress playing a gay character in a stage production of The Color Purple was sacked over homophobic comments she made five years ago.Seyi Omooba, who was due to play the lead role of Celie, claimed the Bible made clear homosexuality was wrong in the eyes of God and that people could not be born gay.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Strictly Come Dancing: Who might replace Darcey Bussell?:::::Image caption Dame Darcey Bussell with Strictly judges Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Shirley Ballas The news that Dame Darcey Bussell is to step down from Strictly Come Dancing has left a giant gap on the judges' desk.The former Royal Ballet principal dancer said on Wednesday she is stepping down after seven series to focus on "other commitments" in dance.Her spokesperson said reports in a tabloid newspaper suggesting she decided to leave because she was embarrassed by "scandals" on the show and pay issues were "categorically untrue".Here are eight possible contenders for the plum position on BBC One's hit show.Oti Mabuse A professional Latin American dancer, Oti joined Strictly in 2015 as dance partner to Olympic boxer Anthony Ogogo.Cast on the show following a stint on ITV's Let's Dance, Mabuse quickly won over audiences with her infectious charisma.Earlier this year she starred as a captain on BBC One's new talent contest The Greatest Dancer, a commitment that saw her drop out of her Strictly duties in 2018.Speaking to BBC News in March, the 28-year-old described the experience as "just brilliant", adding it was "great learning curve" to be "on the other side of the table".Ashley Roberts Image copyright Getty Images The former Pussycat Doll joined last year's Strictly line-up as a contestant after two years as a judge on ITV's Dancing on Ice.She trained in ballet, tap, modern and lyrical dance, and her often flawless performances led some viewers to claim her experience gave her an unfair advantage.But that training as well as her experience in showbusiness and as a TV judge could all count in the 36-year-old's favour when Strictly producers fill Dame Darcey's seat.Alfonso Ribeiro The former Fresh Prince star put in a highly entertaining guest appearance on the Strictly panel when he filled in for Bruno Tonioli on the last series, and has pedigree after winning Dancing With The Stars in 2014.But his greatest contribution to the world of dance is probably creating the Carlton dance - named after his Fresh Prince character Carlton Banks.He tried to sue the makers of Fortnite last year, claiming the game copied his moves, before temporarily dropping the legal action.Nicole Scherzinger Image copyright EPA Another Pussycat Doll, Nicole won Dancing with the Stars, the US version of Strictly, in 2010.And she has also form as a talent show judge, albeit on singing rather than dancing contests - The X Factor in both the US and UK, and The Sing-Off in the US.She's proved herself in the West End too, earning an Olivier Award nomination for Cats.Ashley Banjo Street dancer Banjo shot to fame in 2009 when his troupe Diversity were crowned winners of the third series of Britain's Got Talent.The London-born performer and choreographer went on to become a judge on Sky One talent show Got to Dance, which ran for five series between 2009 and 2014.Having now established himself as a TV judge on Dancing on Ice for the past two series, the talent show specialist could be ready to swap ice for the dancefloor.Karen Hardy The former Strictly professional dancer won in 2006 after being paired with cricketer Mark Ramprakash (pictured).She left the programme in 2009, but continued to appear on spin-off Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two.Her "choreography corner", where she reviews the previous Saturday programme, has become a staple of the sister show.She also opened her own London dance school - Karen Hardy Studios - in 2008.Anton Du Beke Du Beke has been a professional dancer on Strictly since the show began in 2004.Were he to hang up his dancing shoes, he might be ideally suited to take on a judging role.The 52-year-old has yet to be a winner on the show, but he reached the final in 2015 when he competed with Katie Derham.The pair finished in fourth place.He has also been critical of the adjudicators in the past, finding particular fault with US singer Donny Osmond's role as guest judge in 2014."It wasn't the greatest thing to happen," he told the Telegraph."They just need to make sure they have someone from a dance background on the panel."Helen Richey Image copyright Getty Images The Melbourne-born former ballroom and Latin dance champion has been a judge on the Australian version of Dancing With The Stars for 15 series.She trained and competed in the UK, where she lived for 27 years, and was reportedly considered by Strictly producers when Len Goodman left.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
The UK's most-streamed songs may surprise you:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Queen, Miley Cyrus and Eminem were among 2018's most-streamed songs When it was released in 2010, Foster The People's indie-pop anthem Pumped Up Kicks became a moderate hit, reaching number 18 in the UK charts.But the LA band's debut single is enjoying a second lease of life on streaming services.Last year, it was the UK's most-streamed song of all the records released in 2010, beating hits like Lady Gaga's Telephone and Cee-Lo's Forget You, which outsold it at the time.Pumped Up Kicks was played 21 million times last year, according to the BPI, which has revealed the UK's most-streamed songs based on the year they first came out.The recording industry body said 90 billion songs were streamed in the UK last year, an increase of 33.5% from 2017.The data highlighted how songs like Pumped Up Kicks can grow in stature after their release.AC/DC's Thunderstruck and Miley Cyrus's Party In The USA top the streaming charts for 1990 and 2009 respectively, even though they didn't trouble the top 20 at the time."It's a process of songs gathering momentum as time goes on," said Rob Crutchley of the BPI, who compiled the figures."A few of those tracks have featured in TV programmes and films, which helps push them over the edge in terms of gaining even more mass popularity, as new audiences become exposed to them."Queen were notable beneficiaries of this boost in 2018 following the release of the Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody.Don't Stop Me Now became the most-streamed song from 1978; while Bohemian Rhapsody (the song) was the most-played track from the entire 1970s, overtaking Earth Wind & Fire's September.The Spinners' Rubberband Man enjoyed a surge in popularity after its use in Avengers: Infinity War, as did Pat Benatar's We Belong, which featured in Deadpool 2.Even older films can have a halo effect - with Daryl Hall & John Oates' You Make My Dreams becoming 1980's biggest song thanks to its use in the 2009 rom-com 500 Days of Summer.At the same time, some of pop's biggest artists are missing from the BPI's chart - with no entries for the Beatles, Abba, Madonna or David Bowie.Most-streamed songs 1990 - 2018 Year Artist Song 2018 streams (million) 2018 Drake God's Plan 147.4 2017 Keala Settle/Greatest Showman cast This Is Me 114.7 2016 Bruno Mars Finesse 54.7 2015 Sia Cheap Thrills 26.5 2014 Ed Sheeran Thinking Out Loud 30.6 2013 George Ezra Budapest 31.3 2012 Passenger Let Her Go 22.5 2011 Macklemore & Ryan Lewis Can't Hold Us 26.3 2010 Foster the People Pumped Up Kicks 21.0 2009 Miley Cyrus Party In The USA 18.0 2008 Jason Mraz I'm Yours 26.9 2007 Arctic Monkeys Fluorescent Adolescent 22.7 2006 The Kooks Naive 26.9 2005 Kanye West ft Jamie Foxx Gold Digger 21.2 2004 Mario Let Me Love You 19.0 2003 The Killers Mr Brightside 46.9 2002 Eminem Lose Yourself 23.6 2001 Nickelback How You Remind Me 11.4 2000 Linkin Park In The End 16.8 1999 TLC No Scrubs 22.6 1998 Goo Goo Dolls Iris 20.1 1997 The Verve Bittersweet Symphony 17.5 1996 Blackstreet ft Dr Dre No Diggity 17.9 1995 Oasis Wonderwall 34.1 1994 Mariah Carey All I Want For Christmas Is You 39.0 1993 The Cranberries Linger 9.7 1992 Radiohead Creep 10.1 1991 Nirvana Smells Like Teen Spirit 18.6 1990 AC/DC Thunderstruck 12.7 Elsewhere, Christmas songs continued to be popular, with Wham's Last Christmas and Mariah Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You scoring huge streaming numbers.Other tracks simply lingered in people's minds, long after contemporary hits faded.Nave by The Kooks has been riding high for the three years we've compiled these statistics," said Crutchley."The album it's from sold a lot of copies and they've still got a big, hardcore fanbase - but it's only becoming apparent now what a cult hit that song's turned into."And sometimes that's what this is about, I think.Songs can be rediscovered and gain momentum a bit later on."Crutchley added the availability of once-obscure songs on streaming services could even rescue artists from the dustbin of history."Do you remember Maniac by Michael Sembello?It was in the film Flashdance but it never charted in the UK top 40.Now it's getting more than four million streams a year."So if you're embedded in history in some little way, there's a chance people will go back and discover your music.You're there for posterity in some ways."Most-streamed songs from the 60s, 70s and 80s Year Artist Song 2018 Streams (million) 1989 The Stone Roses Waterfall 8.2 1988 Tracy Chapman Fast Car 14.3 1987 The Pogues ft Kirsty MacColl Fairytale of New York 29.4 1986 Chris Rea Driving Home for Christmas 19.8 1985 Shakin' Stevens Merry Christmas Everyone 21.0 1984 Wham!Last Christmas 34.4 1983 Eurythmics Sweets Dream (Are Made of This) 21.5 1982 Toto Africa 32.1 1981 Journey Don't Stop Believin' 24.3 1980 Daryl Hall & John Oates You Make My Dreams 24.8 1979 Paul McCartney Wonderful Christmas Time 15.9 1978 Queen Don't Stop Me Now 25.4 1977 ELO Mr Blue Sky 26.7 1976 Fleetwood Mac Go Your Own Way 20.1 1975 Queen Bohemian Rhapsody 29.8 1974 Lynyrd Skynyrd Sweet Home Alabama 14.9 1973 Elton John Step Into Christmas 21.6 1972 Stevie Wonder Superstition 19.5 1971 John Denver Take Me Home Country Roads 16.5 1970 Elton John Your Song 12.5 1969 The Jackson 5 I Want You Back 20.4 1968 Otis Redding (Sittin' on) The Dock of the Bay 11.2 1967 Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell Ain't No Mountain High Enough 18.3 1966 The Rolling Stones Paint It Black 9.9 1965 The Four Tops I Can't Help Myself 8.7 1964 The Temptations My Girl 12.5 1963 Andy Williams It's The Most Wonderful Time 12.3 1962 Sam Cooke Bring It On Home to Me 5.1 1961 Ben E King Stand By Me 16.2 1960 Etta James At Last 6.8 Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Geoffrey Rush: Australian actor wins defamation case against Nationwide News:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Geoffrey Rush sued a Sydney newspaper for defamation last year Australian actor Geoffrey Rush has won a defamation case against the publisher of a Sydney newspaper which accused him of inappropriate behaviour towards a former co-star.Judge Michael Wigney said he was "not satisfied" that the incidents detailed in The Daily Telegraph, published by Nationwide News, had occurred.He said Mr Rush's former co-star Eryn Norvill's evidence was "inconsistent".He also said she was "prone to exaggeration and embellishment".Judge Wigney ruled that Mr Rush, 67, should be awarded A$850,000 (464,420; $608,680) and would be entitled to more compensation, the exact amount of which would be decided at a later date.He was originally seeking more than A$25m in damages, reported the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Mr Rush had previously said that his career had been "irreparably damaged" by the newspaper's reports.The alleged incidents detailed in The Daily Telegraph article date back to a 2015 theatre production of King Lear in which Mr Rush acted alongside Ms Norvill.
Jack Cole: The 'scary' dancer who made Marilyn sparkle:::::Image copyright Alamy Image caption The sensuality of Marilyn Monroe's dance routine in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes was ground-breaking for 1953 He's been called the father of American jazz dancing.But Jack Cole was also the man who gave Marilyn Monroe her dance moves.Another Cole pupil, Chita Rivera - star of the original Broadway West Side Story - recalls him as a demanding choreographer but, more than 60 years on, says she'll never have cause for complaint.Rivera is one of the few people still to have memories of dancing with Cole in his prime.She's been a Broadway star since 1957, when she created the role of Anita in West Side Story.A year before that she'd appeared with Cole on TV on Sid Caesar's comedy show.They performed an extended and powerful version of the jazz standard the Beale Street Blues."Jack was extraordinary," Rivera says."The style he created was like nothing else you'd seen.He could be exciting and scary and maybe you didn't always want to hang around with him - but I'm delighted we got to dance together at the beginning of my career."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jack Cole danced "like a big cat" Cole was born John Ewing Richter in 1911 into a blue collar family in New Jersey.The turning point in his career came as a teenager when he started to dance with the Denishawn School of Dancing and Related Arts.Its founders Ruth St Denis and Ted Shawn had abandoned European balletic tradition to explore other cultures - especially Indian dance.Improbable as it seems, the Indian influence would still be visible two decades later when Cole devised Marilyn Monroe's most famous dance routine, the Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend sequence.Rivera recalls how Cole performed."Jack danced in the floor, as opposed to above the floor.It wasn't so much great balletic leaps - watch Beale St Blues online and you'll see the way Jack moved.There's a mixture of femininity there but also he dances like a guy.Strong, really strong - like a big cat.It's something you see in Rudolf Nureyev as well: they were both very, very male."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Chita Rivera starring in West Side Story Dance critic Debra Levine is writing a book about Cole."Jack started almost as a street kid.When he started to dance he didn't hesitate to tread both the artistic path and the commercial path: he fell in love with Asian forms and they never really left him whatever he did later."To picture the typical Jack Cole style think of an Indian dancer.His legs will be spread wide in what dancers call the second position, with feet turned out.There'll be a bend in the knee and a kind of torque in the torso.Even more distinctive are the arms - they'll be spread wide with the hands making very intricate shapes.The Indian influence is obvious and it's what now we'd call a mash-up."Remember that Jack hit the streets of New York City in 1931-32 when the economy was dire.He desperately needed to make a buck and I think what saved him was the repeal of prohibition in America in 1933."Suddenly people could drink alcohol again and there was a boom in nightclubs.We're talking about the Rainbow Room in Manhattan and Chez Paree in Chicago or in Los Angeles it would be Slapsy Maxie's or Ciro's.But the dance numbers they staged could be incredibly cheesy and low-end.So Jack created routines which entertained but which also used elements of modern dance and the ethnic forms which fascinated him."Hollywood soon spotted his talent.Yet Levine says his film career got off to a bad start.In 1941 he was headhunted to dance in a forgotten musical called Moon Over Miami.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jack Cole worked with Marilyn Monroe on other films such as Let's Make Love "They were enacting a Seminole (American Indian) ritual.But Jack Cole was such a sensual dancer and there was a little bit too much pelvis and too much bare chest - just too much male sensuality.So the performance stayed on the cutting-room floor but his movie career flourished as a choreographer."Marilyn Monroe's Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend sequence from Gentlemen Prefer Blondes became Cole's best-known number.It's been borrowed by performers including Madonna and Kylie Minogue.For 1953 it was wildly over the top.In a tight satin dress in shocking fuchsia, Monroe flirts with 20 or so male dancers clad in white tie and tails.Rivera says it's classic Cole."Jack was demanding but rightly so.He dictated every last detail of how he wanted you to twist an arm or the exact shape you needed with your hands.I remember once he worked with us for hours on how a particular handclap should sound.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jack Cole brought out the exotic in Rita Hayworth's performance in Gilda of Put The Blame On Mame "With Marilyn he was working with a great star who wasn't really a dancer.Yet he makes her move superbly.He knew that Marilyn totally understood her own sexuality and sensuality.He took that and surrounded her with men so there was nothing but sex on that screen.Marilyn was so feminine in that number and he let her float on top of that, with just tiny shrugs of the shoulder or a little turn of the neck.It's one of the great movie dances."Levine refers to Cole's work with Monroe as micro-choreography."There are studio stills from Twentieth Century-Fox which show Jack directing the whole sequence, even though in theory it's a Howard Hawks film."That eye-popping dress Marilyn wore was something Jack Cole suggested and he has her touching herself in ways you wouldn't expect in 1953.It's near-porn.It's fascinating too that there are shots of Marilyn rehearsing with Gwen Verdon, who for years was Jack's assistant and who in some ways was his muse.Marilyn and Gwen Verdon practised the hell out of it."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jack Cole demanded perfection Ultimately Verdon left Cole to work with and marry Bob Fosse, a great choreographer who was influenced by him.Cole features briefly in the new FX series Fosse/Verdon.After Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Monroe always insisted Cole had to work with her whenever she was required to dance on screen, such as in Some Like it Hot (1959).A precursor to his work with Monroe had come when Cole choreographed Rita Hayworth for the song Put The Blame On Mame in the film Gilda.Though Hayworth already had more dance experience, Cole brought out an even more exotic glamour in her.But Rivera says he wouldn't have treated even big stars with kid gloves."He demanded perfection but great choreographers do.Even the best dancers don't get out of bed hungry to put themselves through all the pain and effort ahead.Jack had the gift to make people want to do what he wanted them to do."In the 1960s I worked with Jack again on a stage musical called Zenda: it could be tough but every day was rewarding.The only time I would probably cry would be if I couldn't please him.Dancers are like that."Cole died in 1974 and Levine thinks people are reawakening to his talent."Partly it's the Marilyn Monroe effect.But it's wrong to label him the father of all American jazz dance.That was the invention of African Americans.But Jack successfully codified jazz dance and then he overlays all those characteristic Indian movements."Levine says even Gene Kelly learnt from him."Kelly was backstage once at Slapsy Maxie's in LA after a Cole performance and he knelt down and kissed Jack's foot."He said without you Daddy we're nothing - we're all following you."A radio version of this article can be heard on BBC World Service Witness History.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

Avengers: Endgame fans queue for hours for cinema tickets:::::Image copyright Walt Disney Studios Advance sales of Avengers: Endgame movie tickets in Singapore caused cinema websites to crash on Wednesday.Singaporean Marvel fans took to social media to complain after being unable to purchase cinema tickets.Shaw Cinema introduced an online queue management system that saw over 72,000 people waiting for hours for their turn to select tickets.Some people took advantage of the situation to resell the tickets online.Golden Village and Cathay Cinemas both experienced problems with their online payment systems.The cinemas told Channel News Asia that their websites were unable to handle the sheer numbers of fans trying to buy tickets online.Frustrated fans Cinemagoer Devaash Mahantheran said he had to wait for five hours in the Shaw Cinema online queue, before the system crashed and pushed him to the back of the queue.Vincent Wong was similarly unhappy: "No matter which browser and which platform I use, I keep getting an error message and unable to complete my transaction.Take a look at how many seats are on hold with no way to advance to [the] payment stage, and nobody responds on the customer service line."People could still go to the cinemas in person to purchase tickets, and on Singaporean online marketplace mobile app Carousell, there were hundreds of listings reselling pairs of Avengers: Endgame movie tickets at various prices.Tickets are being resold from $20 Singapore dollars (11) all the way up to $600 Singapore dollars (340).Skip Twitter post by @veensenn These seats have been on hold for an hour!The moment someone selects a seat but could not complete the transaction, it gets on-hold permanently!pic.twitter.com/tcF0TgPo4C Vincent Wong (@veensenn) April 10, 2019 Report Marvel fan Jolyn Ng told the BBC that she had anticipated that the pre-sale queues would be really bad.She was so worried that she would not be able to get tickets during the pre-sale on Wednesday that she had asked her employer for leave on 24 April - the film's Singapore release date - so that she could find a way to grab tickets."I had all the cinema websites open in tabs on my computer overnight, and at 09:30am, I was placed 993rd in the Shaw online queue," she told the BBC."But luckily I woke up at 3am due to being on edge, and I was able to buy the tickets from EagleWings Cinematics, a new independent cinema that opened last year."Image copyright Jolyn Ng Image caption Eager cinemagoers in Singapore were left frustrated after hours of queuing online to buy Avengers: Endgame tickets The queuing system used by Shaw is designed to prevent people from crashing websites.It is more commonly seen on websites that see huge spikes in traffic, such as the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play, or the Glastonbury Festival ticket website.Shaw Cinemas apologised to fans who were left disappointed.Image copyright Carousell Image caption Avengers: Endgame tickets on sale on online marketplace app Carousell "It was more than twice the traffic compared to our last encounter of a similar nature, and thus the system moved rather slowly and stalled at times," a spokesperson told Channel News Asia.Singapore has a population of 5.8 million people, and one of the highest per capita cinema attendances in the world.There are 257 cinema screens in the country, and 19 million movie tickets are sold annually, according to the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA).Latest data from the government agency shows that Marvel's The Avengers is the all-time highest grossing movie in Singapore, earning $12.9m Singapore dollars (7.3m) at the box office in 2017.
The mystery of Star Wars and Tunisia's rundown Brutalist hotel:::::Image copyright MOHAMED ZITOUNI The Hotel du Lac has seen better days.Its distinctive shape, resembling an inverted pyramid or a bird in flight, has been making a statement on the Tunis skyline since the early 1970s.It stood once for the ambition and poise of a young nation emerging from colonial rule, stretching its wings.Today it stands abandoned, prey to the elements after years of neglect, its fate hanging in the balance.Demolition is a likely option."The building is on life-support," says Sahbi Gorgy, a Tunisian architect involved in drawing up plans for the site on behalf of its Libyan owners.He told the BBC that restoring the structure would probably cost more than replacing it, especially if further surveys confirm his suspicion that the steel frame has been weakened.Image copyright Alamy Image caption The Sandcrawler provided a fortified mobile home for the mythical Jawas of Tattooine The threat to the hotel has prompted a Tunisian conservation group, Edifices et Memoires, to campaign for its preservation, highlighting its architectural pedigree.The building is a prime example of Brutalism, the 20th Century movement known for its bold, sculptural forms and its exposed, unadorned surfaces of concrete and metal."The hotel is a unique witness to a certain age," Mohamed Zitouni, a Tunis-based architect involved in the preservation campaign, told the BBC."It's one of the rare buildings after Tunisian independence that shows vision and maturity."Hopes for preserving the hotel are also being pinned on an apparent link to the original 1977 Star Wars movie.Its director George Lucas filmed part of his space fantasy in Tunisia, using the Sahara as stand-in for the desert planet of Tattooine.In Tunis, some believe he may have modelled the Sandcrawler, a huge tank-like vehicle featured in the movie, on the Hotel du Lac.The desert locations that appeared in Star Wars have been preserved as tourist attractions.But can "the Force" also save a Brutalist hotel from demolition?Did the hotel inspire the Sandcrawler?"The hotel is supposed to have served as inspiration for the Sandcrawler in Star Wars," an online petition says, prompting reports about the link to the film, which some attributed to "legend".Image copyright Alamy Image caption The story of the making of the first Star Wars in the Tunisian desert has passed into folklore Mr Zitouni subsequently told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that Lucas had seen the building when he first visited Tunis, and was "inspired to draw, or design, a kind of sand tank very similar to the shape of the Hotel du Lac".A key crew member from the original Star Wars, contacted to see if there was indeed a link between the building and the tank-like vehicle, conceded that they did look "kind of similar".But Roger Christian, the British director and set designer who won an Academy Award for his production design on Star Wars, believes any link would be "tenuous" at best.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Barbican Centre (architects: Chamberlin, Powell and Bon) in London is among the UK capital's best known Brutalist structures Christian told the BBC the Sandcrawler owed its look to Ralph McQuarrie, the legendary US concept artist who shaped the aesthetic of all the films in the original Star Wars trilogy.Lucas enlisted McQuarrie early in the film-making process, while he was still writing the script, to illustrate his ideas."Ralph did some beautiful drawings, and the Sandcrawler was drawn up pretty much as it is," Christian says.The parts of the vehicle were constructed at Elstree Studios, near London, and shipped, piece by piece, to Tunisia.On set, Christian sprayed the model down with mud to make it look authentic.Christian says McQuarrie produced the Sandcrawler design before Tunisia was being considered as a possible location.The decision to film there was made in 1976, after Lucas made a reconnaissance trip to the country on the recommendation of the set designer, John Barry.Image copyright PAUL BATEMAN Image caption Ralph McQuarrie's early sketches for the Sandcrawler, from the collection of Paul Bateman Neither Barry nor McQuarrie are still alive.However, McQuarrie's friend and collaborator, Paul Bateman, confirmed to the BBC that the first detailed sketch of the Sandcrawler was ready by April 1975 - a year before Lucas visited Tunisia.Nasa of the future So where did McQuarrie get his ideas from?In the 1950s, he had served in the US military in Korea, and the look and feel of army equipment - bulky vehicles, sleek weapons - can be seen in the machinery in Star Wars.During filming in the Tunisian desert, the model Sandcrawler was, in fact, mistaken for military hardware by a group of Algerian soldiers who were just across the border."They saw this name, Star Wars, and they thought we were building a war machine," Christian says."They had to come over and verify that it was a film set."Image copyright Alamy Image caption Crawler Transporter vehicles shifted US space rockets and shuttles, such as the one pictured in the background After the Korean war, McQuarrie made a living as a technical artist.He produced animation to accompany TV coverage of Nasa's Apollo missions, and he worked for Boeing, producing the manual for assembling the new 747 jumbo jet.It was this apprenticeship, as a sort of master draughtsman of the US aerospace sector, that made McQuarrie's fighting machines of the future so compelling.His Star Wars artwork is like an advanced projection of US technological might - a space race that has outgrown its terrestrial rivalry.Bateman says the idea for the Sandcrawler's massive tank-like treads came from the Nasa Crawler Transporter, a colossal tracked vehicle that lugged the Apollo programme's Saturn rockets to their launch site.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption London's National Theatre (architect: Denys Lasdun) - like many Brutalist buildings - continues to divide opinion By far the biggest influence on McQuarrie's art, however, was the pulp sci-fi of the 1930s through to the 1950s.According to Bateman, the idea for the Sandcrawler's hull-like shape arose from sci-fi tropes of sand-ships and ships of the desert, and evolved into something that "quite literally resembled a ship".Sci-fi architecture Some of the ideas expressed in science fiction can also be found in Brutalist architecture.Brutalism emerged in the 1950s, in post-war Britain.As it spread around the world, it too would be influenced - like the sci-fi of that era - by the imagery of space exploration.You may also be interested in: "This was the prime time of the space age, so everything seemed possible," says Felix Torkar, an architectural historian who helps run the #SOSBrutalism campaign."Daring, futuristic architectural designs were also very much of that time."A typical Brutalist building, he says, might look visionary and simultaneously have a raw, monumental quality - "like the ancient ruins of a forgotten space-faring civilisation".The heyday of Brutalism, from the 1950s to the 1970s, coincided with the process of decolonisation in Africa.Leading Brutalist architects were commissioned for many grand projects - museums, universities, hotels - in the newly liberated nations.Across the continent, dramatic concrete structures were erected to symbolise modernity and an international outlook.Image copyright Alamy Image caption "The ancient ruins of a space-faring civilisation" or the Brutalist Le Pyramide in downtown Abidjan?(architect: Rinaldo Olivieri) Mr Torkar says Brutalist buildings tended to obey three basic rules - "expose the materials, expose the structure, and make it a unique, memorable design".The Hotel du Lac is the work of an Italian architect, Raffaele Contigiani.Its prototype is thought to have been a similar inverted-pyramid design that he exhibited at the Zagreb International Fair in 1957.In Tunis, the upside-down shape offered an elegant solution to problems with the site.As the ground was unstable, the foundations of the building had to be specially constructed - a laborious process.But the hotel's form minimised its footprint, which meant that the foundations would not have to be particularly wide, as long as they were sufficiently deep.Image copyright Dr Ruth Craggs Image caption A Brutalist complex in the University of Zambia campus in Lusaka (architect: Julian Elliot) According to Mr Torkar, the site of the hotel was also notorious for its stench, the result of its proximity to a lagoon that was, at the time, an outlet for Tunis's sewage system.The stench was worst at ground level.By providing more capacity at the top than at the bottom, Contigiani's design ensured that most of the hotel's rooms were lifted clear of the foul air.Why is 'the Force' being invoked in Tunis?Tunisia had been independent for 20 years when Star Wars, a myth of empire and rebellion, was filmed there.The country appealed to the film-makers for practical reasons.Lucas had a relatively meagre budget, and Tunisia was suitably cheap.Plus there were stunning desert locations with plenty of hotels nearby, mandatory for hosting a Hollywood film crew.Tunisia's hotel sector was developed after independence to attract foreign visitors.Revenues from tourism have helped power the economy, accounting for some 8% of the GDP.But the number of foreign visitors plummeted after a series of terror attacks at tourist sites in 2015, and the sector is struggling to recover.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Building or spaceship?Set design for Ridley Scott's Alien, released in 1979 Brutalism had emerged from the wreckage of war and empire to provide a global house style for the public sector.It was chosen by governments worldwide to express a radical ideal - that the elected representatives of the people should use public funds to provide buildings for the use of the people.In the last decades of the 20th Century, that ideal would fall out of favour, and its concrete forms would fall into ruin.Tellingly, the films of the time that are clearly influenced by Brutalism - Blade Runner, Alien, A Clockwork Orange - tend to portray bleak, dystopian futures.Neglected, many Brutalist buildings would be held up to symbolise the failed policies of governments past.Sited on prime real estate, they would become ready candidates for demolition.Recently, however, there has been renewed interest in the movement, triggered by the fear that some of its finest structures could be lost forever.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Visitors to Tunisia visit the locations where scenes from the Star Wars series were filmed The Sandcrawler, though not inspired by a building, would end up inspiring a building.In 2013, the film company founded by Lucas opened an office in Singapore that shared the vehicle's name and echoed its shape.Swathed in glass, it is in no way a Brutalist structure.So what lies behind the claim that the Hotel du Lac was the model for the Sandcrawler?Mr Zitouni hints at a possible source, telling the BBC that people who worked at the hotel used to boast about how their building had inspired Lucas.Every empire has its myths of origin, official and unofficial.For the Star Wars franchise, the Tunisian desert provides the backdrop for the official story.Meanwhile, the urban myth from Tunis testifies to its might.In 2015, Fortune magazine estimated the worth of the franchise since its inception, including earnings from box office, home entertainment and merchandise.The total figure came to $42bn (32bn) - just $1bn less than Tunisia's GDP in that year.
Why Dame Diana Rigg 'loves to be disliked':::::Image copyright EPA Image caption Dame Diana was given a special award last week at the Canneseries festival As Game of Thrones returns for its final series, Dame Diana Rigg - aka Olenna Tyrell - looks back on her time with the hit HBO show.She may have had many of the best lines on Game of Thrones, but Dame Diana Rigg says she has not watched the series "before or since" she appeared in it.Accepting a special award at this year's Canneseries TV festival in France, the British actress said she "hadn't got a clue" about what was happening on the show.Olenna left at the end of the last series by drinking poison - a death scene she said was "just wonderful".Image copyright HBO/Kobal/Shutterstock Image caption Olenna Tyrell made her final appearance in Game of Thrones last year "She does it with dignity and wit, and wit is not often in final death scenes," says the actress, who will celebrate her 81st birthday in July.The young Rigg became famous in the 1960s for playing Emma Peel in TV series The Avengers.Being offered Tyrell in 2013, she says, echoed the circumstances of her first starring role."They just called my agent," she explains."The world turns full circle, because just like with The Avengers, I wasn't watching Game of Thrones and had absolutely no idea of its influence in the world."It was a job, they sent me a script, and I thought 'I can do this.'Image copyright PA/ITV Image caption Rigg shooting The Avengers with Patrick Macnee in 1965 "Interestingly enough, they tested me very early on," the actress recalls."One of my earliest scenes was incredibly difficult, listing all the things my marching army would need."It went on forever, talking about the sheep and the cows and the soldiers.I read that and thought, 'these guys are testing an old actress to see if she can get it into her head.'"I thought, 'I'm going to do it in one take.'And I did."Rigg is also known for playing Tracy, the only woman who became Mrs James Bond, in 1969 film On Her Majesty's Secret Service.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dame Diana Rigg speaks to the BBC in 2013 Given the choice, though, she'd choose Olenna every time."I love playing bad [characters]," she says."They are so much more interesting than good."There are some actors who don't like to play bad; they like to be liked.I love to be disliked.Olenna had the best lines, they were very kind with their scripts."The issue of pay equality in the film industry has been highlighted of late, not least by the revelation that Michelle Williams was paid a fraction of what Mark Wahlberg earned for reshooting scenes in All the Money in the World.Rigg is highly supportive of Williams and her backing for the US Paycheck Fairness Act, having discovered while working on The Avengers that she was being paid less than one of its cameramen."I remember thinking, 'something's very wrong here,'" she explains."When I complained publicly, the newspapers got hold of it, and I was represented as a mercenary young woman stepping out of line and demanding money."I was lonely as well because no one supported me.I did get more money, but thereafter I was labelled as go-getting and 'hard' - and it was unfair because I wasn't.Image copyright ITV Image caption Her recent roles include the Duchess of Buccleuch in Victoria "The fight goes on," she continues."I wonder if anyone's done a survey as to whether people go to watch a male or a female lead."I go to see a female lead as often as a male one, so why there's disparity in the pay cheque I have no idea.Bosses need to be talked to about this."Dame Diana was honoured in Cannes for a lifetime working in television that saw her recently appear as the Duchess of Buccleuch in ITV's Victoria.For all her many credits, though, she does not tend to watch herself on screen."Been there, done that, all of it," she says."Dredging up the past is not my style.I prefer to move on."Canneseries runs until 10 April in the south of France.Game of Thrones returns to US television on 14 April and starts on 15 April in the UK on Sky Atlantic.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Sheffield artist Phlegm's sleeping giants draw giant crowds:::::Image copyright Getty Images For the past six weeks, an abandoned cutlery factory in Sheffield has become the final resting place for a group of giant mythical creatures.And thousands of people have flocked to pay their respects, queuing for up to four hours to see them.The ancient creatures are actually sculptures created by a street artist called Phlegm for the exhibition, titled Mausoleum of the Giants.And it was a big hit - 12,000 people visited before it ended on Saturday."We have had people from New York, from Italy, from Norway come over just to see the show," according to Tamar Millen, from Sheffield City Council, who helped organise the exhibition."People drove up from Plymouth for the opening night, people drove down from Dundee.It's just been astounding."We're so glad people have put the effort in to wait.The first Saturday and Sunday we were open we had freezing rain and people still queued for two-and-a-half or three hours.It was quite amazing."Image copyright PA Image copyright Getty Images Image copyright Getty Images Phlegm, who was born in north Wales and moved to Sheffield in his teens, keeps his real identity anonymous.He's known for his murals around the UK and around the world, including in New York, Toronto and Melbourne.He was approached by Sheffield City Council and the University of Sheffield to create Mausoleum of the Giants.Despite its popularity, they couldn't extend the exhibition because work is now beginning to convert the derelict factory into flats.Image copyright @Silvie_s Phlegm's giant creatures were said by a press release to be thousands of years old and "have seen rivers erode and mountains change".They came to rest in the factory's central courtyard, corridors and five rooms."It's a melancholy, quiet feeling," Tamar Millen said."This is their final resting place.In each room are more characters that are here to say goodbye to each other."We've had people come back to queue two or three times at different times of day to see it in different lighting.Image copyright @MartinIllingwor Image copyright Alex Taylor "People have been overwhelmed.There's a 'wow' moment as you come down the corridor into the main room and you get to meet the giants for the first time.People stand there for quite a while just taking it in."Everybody has been absolutely amazed - firstly that it was free, because we had Arts Council funding, and secondly that it happened here in the city."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion, email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
The Manchester galleries using art to try to change the world:::::Image caption Alistair Hudson has long been a champion of "useful art" What use is art?For the boss of Manchester's two main civic galleries, art isn't just for looking at, or for buying and selling - it can improve our lives in some unexpected ways."I want people to say, 'Oh yeah, art's actually quite useful, art's actually really important.'"Alistair Hudson has given Manchester Art Gallery and sister venue the Whitworth a new mission - to be useful.He gives some examples of how art is already utilised beyond gallery walls.Trainee dermatologists in Manchester study art in order to improve their visual skills, making them better at spotting anomalies.A lecturer at Manchester Business School teaches how important aesthetics and storytelling are for the success of big businesses like Apple.Image copyright Alan Williams Image caption The Whitworth Art Gallery was named the UK's Museum of the Year in 2015 Hudson recounts how he helped curate an image for the government's new Home Office headquarters in 2005 - right down to the positions TV news crews would take up outside."The shot you get was constructed as part of an art project, so what was beamed out on the Six O'Clock News involved sculptural elements and was aestheticised to a certain extent."He even says Russian President Vladimir Putin's right-hand man Vladislav Surkov trained in conceptual art, and there's a theory that he used those techniques to keep Putin in power.Hudson now wants to harness the power of art for the good of the city.The Whitworth was named the Museum of the Year in 2015 and Hudson has given it a new mission statement - to "use art for social change".It says: "Art should address what matters in people's lives, respond to current urgencies and propose solutions to the issues around us."The gallery will "value art for what it can do, not how much it is worth", it adds.Image copyright David Oates Image caption The Whitworth's new era has begun with an exhibition titled Joy For Ever: How To Use Art To Change The World And Its Price In The Market Hudson explains: "The art market serves a very small number of people in society.Museums in the modern, contemporary era - their programmes have been really driven by the contemporary art market, not necessarily by public interest."Artistic ideas, creative thinking and the transformative power of making stuff can play a big part in solving problems in areas like education, health, politics, technology, economics and the environment, he believes.Hudson took over the Manchester galleries in 2017 and has launched their new era with an exhibition at the Whitworth titled Joy For Ever: How To Use Art To Change The World And Its Price In The Market.The title and exhibition are both influenced by 19th Century thinker John Ruskin, whose ideas about creative freedom, craftsmanship and architecture went on to influence politics, education and the conservation movement.Hudson wants to update those ideas for the 21st Century."What that means is you start to get involved in shaping and contributing to the infrastructure of society and how it works, not just creating a leisure resource or a tourist attraction."We will still function in those terms, but ultimately this is about a much bigger role for art and arts thinking in decision-making - the kind of architecture we build, city planning, ecology, education, public housing" Image copyright Hyndburn Academy Image caption Students from Hyndburn Academy in Blackburn helped choose the artworks for the new exhibition Future plans include an exhibition called Economics: The Blockbuster, which will attempt to demystify the financial world and propose alternative economic models."And we're talking about creating a Whitworth Business School, where we will teach economics through the medium of art," he says.Platt Hall in Fallowfield, Manchester, is a third venue under Hudson's control.It was the Gallery of Costume until recently, but the costumes had to be moved because of a moth infestation.That means there's an opportunity for an overhaul.There are plans for an "experimental museum" inspired by the Victorian institutes and settlements where the working classes would learn skills and take part in creative pursuits."I'm interested in picking up the baton of that," Hudson says."We can't quite do the same patriarchal Victorian version of do-gooding, but what would a crowdsourced, user-generated version of that be now?"Image copyright Alan Williams Image caption Artists will help design a new park keeper's house in the Whitworth's grounds Meanwhile, funds are currently being raised to build a new park keeper's house in Whitworth Park, which may provide a model for future housing developments.The park will also gain a newly-reconstructed version of a road Ruskin once attempted to build with the help of 12 University of Oxford undergraduates, including Oscar Wilde and Hardwicke Rawnsley, who went on to found the National Trust.Hudson moved to Manchester from the Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art (Mima), where he also put his ideas into practice.They included a regular free lunch in the gallery for people from across the city.It wasn't an artwork as such, but it harnessed the power of a gallery, he explains."We redirected our exhibitions budget to pay for cooking for people every week.Around that table you would have gallery goers, homeless people, refugees, the police, the mayor, dementia groups...The most amazing range of people all gathered around this meal."Image copyright David Oates Image caption The Joy For Ever exhibition opened at the Whitworth at the end of March They would meet new people and have the chance to raise issues with people in authority."It became this moment in the week where you could start to galvanise opinion and energy that could then be directed in very positive ways," Hudson says."But it also became the place where a lot of these have groups who didn't have a voice could have recourse to power.They could use the gravitas of the public institution in order to talk up to power - whether that's the mayor or the council.That became a very interesting way of working.It started to affect a lot of decisions."The Whitworth and Manchester Art Gallery have long done work in their communities, and the idea of "useful art" has been coming back into fashion elsewhere.But this new direction will be a test of how much difference it can make."Art's not the answer to everything," Hudson reflects."But I want people to be empowered by the idea that it's part of the package to determine how we have a better way of living."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk,
Mahalia: The singer drunk-dialling her way to fame:::::Image copyright Olivia Rose Image caption The singer was tipped for success on the BBC's Sound of 2019 list Mahalia is supposed to be having a day off.Instead, she's spent most of the afternoon on a conference call about her debut album, and now she's being submitted to a gruelling BBC interview."You're totally not interrupting me at all," she laughs."I'm just making a cup of tea."Bright and chatty, the 20-year-old is getting accustomed to a busy schedule.In the past couple of months, she's won YouTube's One To Watch award, been nominated for a Brit, and toured the US with fellow soul star Ella Mai.... but she's far from an overnight success.Born Mahalia Burkmar in Leicester at the turn of the millennium, she started playing guitar and writing songs as a child, and was signed to Atlantic Records when she was just 13.Her first EP, Head Space, emerged a year later, followed by guest slots with Rudimental, a role in Noel Clarke's 2016 film Brotherhood and a tour with Ed Sheeran.In some respects, then, that debut album is long overdue.Getting 'sober' "It's been a weird journey, actually," she says."At first I was purely this girl with a guitar and I was like, 'God, I'm not sure I want to be a singer-songwriter who tours on her own'.So I had to work out how to find new sounds and new sonics and make it somehow a fully-formed thing."But around two years ago, I kind of worked it out and now I feel really confident in the music."The breakthrough was Sober - a song about her tendency to drunk-dial her ex that, brilliantly, Mahalia wrote while she was "a little tipsy" and trying to stay away from her phone.Released in 2017, it's her most-streamed song on Spotify and her most popular hit on the lyric website Genius, where a quarter of a million fans have looked up the words."When I was writing it, I definitely didn't think, 'Everyone's gonna relate to this,'" she says."I was feeling a certain way and needed to get it out - but of all my songs, it's definitely the one that's had the most covers, so there's something about it that's relatable."Musically, Sober set Mahalia's languid, jazzy vocals against brushed keys and a rippling synth bass.It marked a massive departure from the acoustic soul of earlier tracks like 17 and Marry Me, but it instantly felt right."It was the first time I felt like a song had every single part of me within it," she says."[It had] my weird melodies and lyrics and that R&B feel that I knew I loved, but couldn't find on the guitar alone."It just took me a second of not thinking too hard, I think."Publicity-shy Since then, the singer has gone from strength to strength, showcasing a knack for wry, observational lyrics ("I wished I missed my ex"), silky soul beats and the sort of stage presence that can only be earned with seven years' practice.Her latest single Do Not Disturb is the inverse of Sober - with Mahalia shutting down needy texts from a persistent boyfriend and carving out some time to herself."With phones, everybody always has easy access to you," she explains."And it's really difficult to deal with, especially when you're trying to get over somebody and they call or text or email or send a DM."It's like, 'Oh my God, leave me alone!'So when I was writing that song, that's what I was trying to tap into.I'm going to put myself on do not disturb as well as my phone."But her most personal song is Proud Of Me - which looks back at her childhood in Leicester and the people who supported her dreams."I've never been religious/Instead my momma showered me in kisses," she sings with a distinct Les-tah accent."Thirteen with the big dream and Daddy said I could be anything."Music was a constant in the family home, and she clearly remembers trying to emulate her father's guitar skills."My dad was totally that kind of cliche superhero in my life, so I used to look at him and be like, 'God I want to be like you,'" she says.Further inspiration came from her high school teacher Mr Hill."He was the one who'd come to get me from my English lesson and take me to my guitar lessons because I'd forgotten," she says."And he's the one who'd stay around after school and teach me to read music."I don't think he really knows how important he was."Proud of Me doesn't just look back at Mahalia's formative experiences, it sets out her manifesto for fame: "I wanna keep bits of me to myself/I don't need your publicity all up in my business/That right there is a sickness.""I definitely like to keep my personal life to myself," she says."But I mean the silly bits, like the drunken bits, or the bits at home, or the arguments with my boyfriend or my friends."But anything I can do creatively, no, I want everyone to have that."Image caption Mahalia played the BBC Introducing stage at Radio 1's Biggest Weekend in Swansea last summer In 2019, Mahalia's getting a helping hand from BBC Radio 1, which has put the singer on its Brit List - guaranteeing her next three songs a place on the station's playlist.Previous recipients include Stormzy, Anne-Marie, Lewis Capaldi, Sam Fender and Mabel, so it augurs well for the young singer as she finishes her debut album.As she sets off on a short UK tour this week, she's "literally in and out of the studio" every day, "tying up loose ends and making sure it's perfect".She explains: "I'm at a point now where I'm like, 'OK, its taken seven years to get here so I'm not about to rush this last little moment.'"I'm still climbing up the hill and I'm nearly at the top."And what about the drunk texting - is that all a distant memory now?"Oh no," she laughs."I still wake up with beer fear at least once a month."Image copyright Olivia Rose Mahalia plays in Manchester and London this week.Her debut album will be out later this year.Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
In pop, stars are exploring new sexualities:::::Image copyright Universal Records Image caption Ariana Grande said she "didn't feel the need to label" her sexuality Last week, Ariana Grande set the internet on fire with a lyric that suggested she was bisexual.But what was truly remarkable was how unremarkable the line was."I like women and men," the 25-year-old sang casually on Monopoly, a duet with her friend Victoria Monet.It was a throwaway comment, sandwiched between lyrics about songwriting royalties and her overwhelming workload ("I need a twin") but it sparked a flurry of speculation about the star's private life."Is she bi or nah?"asked one fan on Instagram, to which Monet replied: "She said what she said."'My first love' On Twitter, another fan commented, "Ariana ain't gotta label herself," prompting the pop star to respond: "I haven't before and still don't feel the need to now".Grande isn't alone.After decades of closeted artists and coded lyrics, a new generation of gender and sexually-fluid pop stars are challenging stereotypes and celebrating their identity through music.A significant breakthrough came in 2012, when Frank Ocean posted an open letter to Tumblr, describing how he'd fallen for a man when he was 19."It was my first love, it changed my life," he wrote."There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling.No choice."Notably, Ocean chose to address his bisexuality at the start of his career (the letter was originally destined for the liner notes of his debut album, Channel Orange) and it did nothing to harm his sales or his reputation.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Frank Ocean addressed his bisexuality in the song Chanel, singing: "I see both sides like Chanel" "I think the landscape has changed dramatically for queer artists," Olly Alexander from Years & Years told the BBC last year."In the past, we've all been familiar with pop stars coming out in the middle of their careers, or after they've become huge and that feels like a heavy narrative to queer people."Now it seems to be really changing that artists can be out from the start of their career; and it's not some sort of sensationalised headline."In the last few years, artists like Anne-Marie, Troye Sivan, Harry Styles, Christine and the Queens and Demi Lovato have all talked about same-sex attraction or bisexuality in their lyrics.Miley Cyrus has been particularly upfront, telling Paper Magazine: "I'm down with any adult - anyone over the age of 18 who is down to love me."And when Janelle Monae defined herself as pansexual in a Rolling Stone profile last year, searches for the term rose by 11,000% on the online dictionary Merriam-Webster.Pop songs are increasingly likely to feature same-sex pronouns and queer perspectives, while Monae earned a Grammy nomination for her song Pynk, a sex-positive celebration of female genitalia and self-love.Joe Nellist from the LGBT Foundation says musicians are simply reflecting their generation's attitude to sexual identity."There's a growing number of young people aged between 16 and 25, that identify as lesbian, gay or bisexual.The figure currently stands at 4.2% [source: ONS], which is more than twice as high as the general population."It indicates we're moving towards a society that's more tolerant and accepting, where people feel confident and comfortable and able to come out at a younger age."Getting it wrong Musicians have also been given the licence to express their sexuality by structural shifts in the music industry, says Rachel Brodsky, managing editor at Grammy.com."In earlier days, popular artists were a little more fenced in, with executives no doubt prioritising what'll move records and make money," she explains."Like, if you talk about a taboo subject on a record, you risk some giant music emporium like Best Buy or Walmart not stocking that record."But the way music is consumed is totally different now, with streaming and the power of social media marketing.Nowadays, labels come after artists because of their authenticity, which usually translates to social media followers."So we see artists having a more significant upper hand when it comes to their image and what they say in their lyrics."It doesn't always go smoothly.Last year, Rita Ora was criticised for the chorus of her song Girls, in which she sang: "Sometimes I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls/ Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls."Some listeners were concerned the lyrics perpetuated a stereotype that women only hook up with other women when they're drunk or because it turns men on.Ora apologised, saying she would "never intentionally cause harm to other LGBTQ+ people", but the incident showed how the world had moved on since Katy Perry sang she kissed a girl and she liked it - as long as her boyfriend didn't mind it.Image copyright Atlantic Records Image caption Rita Ora's Girls was supposed to be an anthem to female empowerment, but it seemed to backfire The idea of bisexuality as a taboo is outdated and damaging, argued US star Halsey, whose songs depict relationships with both women and men."That narrative is so damaging to bisexuality and its place in society," she said, quoting the line "it felt so wrong, it felt so right" from Perry's song."That's something I've had to fight my whole life and something I still fight.I still see people on the internet saying, 'Of course Halsey says she's bisexual.It'll help her sell albums.'"That charge has also been levelled at Ariana Grande, whose apparent declaration of bisexuality was labelled "queerbaiting" by people who pointed out that all of her (public) relationships have been with men.'Sexuality scale' But that's a problematic accusation itself - as though having a heterosexual relationship could somehow "cancel out" any same-sex attraction.The reality is that more and more people are refusing to define themselves by those binary sexual choices.When YouGov asked people to plot themselves on a "sexuality scale", more than a quarter of Britons chose something other than 100% heterosexual.Facebook, which is as reliable a social barometer as any, also offers users more than 70 gender options, including bi-gender, pangender, non-binary and two spirit (although gender, it should be noted, is separate to sexuality).Seeing these trends reflected in popular culture is hugely encouraging says Joe Nellist."The impact it can have for young people who are coming to terms with their own sexuality is really powerful," he says.Even non-LGBT artists like Little Mix are "becoming real allies to LGBT people," he says - noting how the band recently played Secret Love Song under a rainbow flag in Dubai, where gay sex is illegal."It's a real positive move.It means that even non-LGBT artists are standing up for LGBT young people in particular."Pop singer King Princess agrees it's crucial to have positive role models."When I was a kid, I wanted somebody to look up to, whose music I was excited about, who was gay," she said in January.Instead, she ended up following androgynous, but predominantly straight, artists like Marc Bolan, David Bowie and Led Zeppelin."There was this ambiguity from the people who were on stage, like, 'You don't have to be a boy, you don't have to be a girl, you can wear tight-ass pants."I was just like, 'This seems like my lane.I like this type of showmanship.This is making me feel comfortable about my sexuality.These guys are totally gay.'"Now making music on her own terms, the singer is relaxed at being labelled a "queer icon in the making"."I'm down to take that on," she says."And it's not about my songs being gay.I hope my music's really thoughtful and strong and people just get with it.At the end of the day, that's really what this is about."That's why Rachel Brodsky has reservations about acts like King Princess, Tegan and Sara and Troye Sivan being branded "queer pop"."Queer isn't a genre, it's a sexual preference," she says."And if we use the word 'queer' to describe someone's sound, we risk marginalising artists who, ideally, deserve to be integrated into the greater pop pool."It's like using the term 'all-female band.'What does it matter what someone's gender or sexual preference is when it comes to music?"At the end of the day, everyone's an artist.Let's stick to describing sound as a form of classification instead of appearance and sexuality, shall we?"Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
