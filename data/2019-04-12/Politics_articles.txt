Rod Rosenstein says it’s ‘completely bizarre’ to say William Barr is ‘trying to mislead people’ on Mueller report:::::Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein defended attorney general William Barrs handling of the Mueller report, just days after Barr testified before a House appropriations subcommittee.In his first interview since the Mueller investigation wrapped up, Rosenstein said that he believed it was strange to say the attorney general was misleading the public on the highly-anticipated report.COMEY SCOFFS AT BARR TESTIMONY, CLAIMS SURVEILLANCE IS NOT SPYING Hes being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that hes trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre, Mr. Rosenstein told the Wall Street Journal.It would be one thing if you put out a letter and said, Im not going to give you the report, Rosenstein said.What he said is, Look, its going to take a while to process the report.In the meantime, people really want to know whats in it.Im going to give you the top-line conclusions.Thats all he was trying to do.The deputy attorney general called on the public to have tremendous confidence in Barr and declined to say how the review of the report was going.MEDIA TAKE ISSUE WITH AG BARR FOR SAYING 'SPYING DID OCCUR' ON TRUMP CAMPAIGN During hearings on Capitol Hill this week, Barr defended his decision to send a letter to Congress detailing Muellers principal conclusions because the public would not have tolerated waiting weeks for information.Mueller concluded his nearly two-year Russia investigation in late March and submitted the nearly 400-page confidential report to Barr.The attorney general sent his four-page letter to Congress two days later.Barr wrote in his letter that Mueller found no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion despite efforts by "Russian-affiliated individuals to assist the Trump campaign."He also said that Mueller had not exonerated President Trump on the issue of obstruction of justice.Barr said on Tuesday a redacted version of Muellers report will be made public within a week.Rosenstein, 54, told the Wall Street Journal he hopes to begin a new job toward the end of the summer.Earlier this year, Trump announced he will nominate Jeff Rosen to replace Rosenstein deputy attorney general.President Trump has threatened to fire Rosenstein, who said he stayed in his position at the Department of Justice at Barrs request saying, For me, its a real privilege.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rosensteins comments come after Barr said in Capitol Hill testimony that spying did occur against the 2016 Trump campaign.Former FBI Director James Comey claimed he had no idea what the Justice Department leader was talking about.I have no idea what hes talking about so its hard for me to comment, Comey said.When I hear that kind of language used, its concerning because the FBI and the Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance.I have never thought of that as spying.Fox News Gregg Re, Brooke Singman and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Geraldo Rivera has 'little doubt' Obama DOJ spied on Trump; dismisses 'disingenuous' Comey:::::Geraldo Rivera has little doubt the Obama Justice Department spied on the Trump campaign and made absolutely probable all of the trauma weve gone through with this whole Russia thing.Speaking on Fox & Friends, Rivera, Fox Newss roaming correspondent-at-large, hailed William Barr as an impeccable superb professional after the Attorney Generals testimony this week that spying did occur against the 2016 campaign.Barrs comments have since been questioned by James Comey, the former FBI Director, as well as Democrats and the media.Comey said during a cybersecurity conference in California Thursday that he had never thought of electronic surveillance as spying.Rivera dismissed Comeys latest comments as one of the most disingenuous interviews I have heard recently.COMEY SCOFFS AT BARR TESTIMONY, CLAIMS 'SURVEILLANCE' IS NOT 'SPYING' To say that electronic surveillance and spying are different, what is the exact difference?Is it the method?There is no doubt, I believe they did wiretapTrump's office here in New York, Rivera said.I believe that they turned informants in the way they twisted arms to get people in trouble, get them conflicted.So they had to snitch.Anything they knew about the president.[George] Papadopoulos, Carter Page, you have a situation.Poor Michael Flynn, they twisted these people, they got them in the perjury trap, they had them by the short hairs, got them to cooperate, and guess what?There was still no Russian collusion.But there is no doubt, to make a fine distinction between surveillance and spying is, I think, deflecting attention from what is going on," he said.Despite the backlash from the likes of Comey and Democrats over Barrs testimony, he appeared to refer to intelligence collection that already has been widely reported and confirmed.Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page are currently the subject of a Justice Department inspector general investigation looking at potential misconduct in the issuance of those warrants.That review also reportedly is scrutinizing the role of an FBI informant who had contacts with Trump advisers in the early stages of the Russia investigation.Rivera continued: President Trump, President-elect Trump, was totally paranoid.That doesn't mean he did not have people spying on him.And as it turns out, everything he said basically is correct.BARR HAMMERED FOR STATING 'SPYING DID OCCUR', DESPITE CONFIRMATION OF TRUMP TEAM SURVEILLANCE They went after him full bore It is not overstating to say 'spying'.Maybe its overstating to say there was an attempted coup.But they were talking about the 25th Amendment, they were talking about high management getting cabinet-level officials to declare the president non-compos mentis, and to take over.I mean this was very, very serious.I think the blowback from this is gonna be way bigger than Russia gate was.The collusion illusion is going to dim into history as we find out how a group of non-elected officials try to overthrow the president of the United States.Rivera also reserved a few words for Julian Assange, who was arrested in London Thursday after spending years holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy.Julian Assange, to me, is an anti-American slimeball whose every action was designed to hurt the United States of America.He did it with Chelsea Manning in the spying in 2010, 2011, when he released those videos of civilian casualties from American airstrikes.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP He added: I have nothing but contempt for Julian Assange and I hope that justice finally comes calling.Fox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.
Republican Gov. Matt Bevin aims to make Kentucky history with this year’s re-election bid:::::Matt Bevin is Kentuckys third Republican governor in the last half-century and if hes re-elected this year, hed be the first in party history to win a second term to that office.It likely wont be easy.BEVIN BLASTS TEACHER SICKOUTS Bevin gained national repute as a conservative reformer, but made an enemy of the states powerful teachers union.Hes the least popular governor in the United States, according to a Morning Consult poll in January.Also, the most recent head-to-head poll found Bevin trailing two Democrats vying for their partys nomination in the May 21 primary.Bevins trouble comes largely because he has a reckless mouth, said Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky and veteran political reporter for the Louisville Courier-Journal.He goes after teachers in a sometimes outrageous way.A lot of teachers are Republicans, and a lot of Republicans are teachers.Teachers are still well thought in rural Kentucky.If not for teachers, Bevin would be a prohibitive favorite for re-election.But despite the historical headwinds and friction with the teachers union, Bevin has some significant things going for him as Kentucky joins Louisiana and Mississippi for off-year gubernatorial contests in November.The biggest asset Bevin has, other than a pretty good economy, is Donald Trump, Cross told Fox News.The Trump administrations first foray in 2019 politics was in Kentucky, as Vice President Pence and the first daughter Ivanka Trump made separate appearances in the state with Bevin.Their policies also align.Bevin signed bills making Kentucky a right-to-work state, enacting criminal justice reform to give convicted felons work experience while still incarcerated, banning abortions at 20 weeks of pregnancy, expanding charter schools and protecting religious liberty at public schools and colleges.AL ROKER SLAMS BEVIN With record-breaking economic growth and tens of thousands of new jobs created since Governor Bevin took office, his results-driven policies have reinvigorated Kentuckys economy and are having a real, positive impact on citizens everyday lives, Republican Governors Association spokeswoman Amelia Chass Alcivar told Fox News.While Kentucky has gone Republican in every presidential election since 2000, Democrats and the GOP have evenly split the four governors races since that time.Meanwhile, both of the states two-term governors have been Democrats ever since a state constitutional change in 1992 lifted a prohibition on serving consecutive terms.Further, the leading Democrat in next months primary is state Attorney General Andy Beshear, the son of Bevins two-term Democratic predecessor Steve Beshear.'The biggest asset Bevin has, other than a pretty good economy, is Donald Trump.'Al Cross, director of the Institute for Rural Journalism and Community Issues at the University of Kentucky In the Democratic primary, the younger Beshear is fending off House Minority Leader Rocky Adkins, a 30-year veteran of the legislature, and former state Auditor Adam Edelen, who is spending heavily.Beshear is bypassing his Democratic opponents, while defending his fathers Medicaid expansion against Bevin who seeks work requirements.Cross said almost one-third of the state has benefitted from the elder Beshears Medicaid expansionwhich could be a problem for Bevin.In the GOP primary, a February poll found Beshear with a commanding lead over his opponents.The aforementioned December poll showed Beshear beating Bevin 48 percent to 40 percent, while Adkins narrowly edged out the governor 42 percent to 41 percent in head-to-head match-ups.Governor Bevin is deeply unpopular, to the point that a sizable portion of Republicans view him unfavorably, David Turner, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association, told Fox News.His self-serving ways are going to come back to bite him in November and we feel confident in our chances of flipping this seat from red to blue.Bevin isnt escaping the primary heat either.State Rep. Robert Goforth has played up being a native Kentuckian and taken aim at the New Hampshire-born Bevin, stating, Our commonwealth needs a chief executive who is a conservative molded not by New England and Wall Street, but by Kentucky and Main Street.Bevin buttressed the New Englander image in January, when school districts were closing because of sub-zero temperatures, and he joked: Cmon now, Theres no ice going with it or any snow.I mean, what happened to America?Were getting soft.In another national controversy, Bevin said in March he intentionally exposed his children to chickenpox.On a policy level, Bevin has tried to rein in the debt-strapped state pension system with $43 billion in unfunded liabilities and clashed with the Kentucky Education Association.This prompted the union to lead mass sick outs.Teachers called in sick to protest at the state Capitol and numerous school districts across the state had to shut down for days.Bevin chided some Republican lawmakers for lacking the intestinal fortitude to push his pension reform.Republicans in the legislature do not always get along with Bevin, but prefer him to a Democratic governor and they passed several bills that the governor can take credit for, said Cross, of the University of Kentucky.Despite the incumbents troubles, the state leans Republican this year, said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabatos Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics, which scores political races across the country.You have to acknowledge Matt Bevins approval rating is really weak, but Bevin won the first time by a bigger than expected margin, and he was an underdog, Kondik told Fox News regarding 2015, when Bevin carried 106 out of 120 counties.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He also suggested the election could be an indicator for whether Democrats can mount a challenge against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., next year: If they cant win this race, they likely wont have much of a chance against the Senate majority leader.
Anthony Scaramucci: Dems' push to the left 'almost ensures' Trump's re-election:::::Anthony Scaramucci believes the Democrats' recent push to the left almost ensures Presidents Trump re-election, because the country is not ready for it.Scaramucci, who served as the White House Director of Communications for an eventful 11 days, told Fox & Friends that the recent emergence of socialism as a dominant theme in the run-up to 2020 could seal the deal for his old boss re-election.I Love the message [of the Democrats], because it almost ensures the presidents re-election, he said.The further they push to the left, the country is not ready for that.This is by and large a center-right country, on things like business, free enterprise and self-reliance.When they're pushing that and that's obviously a false promise thats never worked anywhere throughout history and it is certainly not going to work in the United States where this is by and large a group of risk takers.2020 CANDIDATE ANDREW YANG DEFENDS $1,000 A MONTH PROGRAM, SLAMS DEMS FOR WANTING TO ABOLISH ELECTORAL COLLEGE Scaramucci continued that President Trump has done such a number on these guys and hes got inside their melons.Its fun to watch.I have got to tell you, Im glad I am on his team.He added that the Democrats' complete refusal to work with President Trump in Congress, namely a deal on border security, could end up helping him in the long-term.Again, I think it sets him up very well for the 2020 narrative.Say, listen, I tried to do all these different things for the American people.Here is the resistance.'Scaramucci was also asked about Bill Barrs testimony earlier this week when the Attorney General said spying did occur on the Trump campaign ahead of the 2016 election.But the normally combative Scaramucci urged caution.DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: DEMS MAY YET 'FIND A WAY TO NOT WIN' 2020 Well, listen, the Attorney General said it so, I mean, you just have to step back and look at it, remember the distinction between surveillance and spying.Spying means that things happen without the right protocol and right process.And, remember this, the president said this almost two years ago.He added: Remember the distinction, when you say the word spying, that means it was happening, you know, surveillance is OK.Here is the warrant, here is the reason we are doing the surveillance.Spying is a more renegade word if you will.It's a combination of Comey, clapper, Brennan.I think they are all caught in a box now.And someone is going to have to explain what happened.Scaramucci also said he believes that the fallout of the Mueller report has only led to an increase in both sides going after one another.What I don't love about the entire thing though is we are going to be going after each other now and we are politicizing a lot.CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP We are weaponizing and criminalizing a lot of the political differences between the two parties.So, for me, I would love to see these people focus on policy, and focus on fixing the border crisis.Focus on rightsizing the issues that we have with healthcare and things like this.
Comey scoffs at Barr testimony, claims ‘surveillance’ is not ‘spying’:::::Former FBI Director James Comey joined the chorus of Democratic critics complaining about Attorney General Bill Barrs testimony this week that spying did occur against the 2016 Trump campaign, claiming he has no idea what the Justice Department leader is talking about -- and saying he never thought of electronic surveillance as spying.Comey sought to draw a distinction between surveillance -- which was authorized against a Trump adviser -- and spying during a cybersecurity conference in California on Thursday, echoing Democratic lawmakers who have accused Barr of going too far in his Senate testimony this week.BARR HAMMERED FOR STATING 'SPYING DID OCCUR,' DESPITE CONFIRMATION OF TRUMP TEAM SURVEILLANCE I have no idea what hes talking about so its hard for me to comment, Comey said.When I hear that kind of language used, its concerning because the FBI and the Department of Justice conduct court-ordered electronic surveillance, he continued.I have never thought of that as spying.He added: If the attorney general has come to the belief that that should be called spying, wow.Thats going to require a whole lot of conversations inside the Department of Justice.But I dont know what he meant, Comey said.Before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Wednesday, Barr testified that he believes spying did occur on the Trump campaign, adding, the question is whether it was adequately predicated.Barr said he believed it was his obligation to review where there was any misconduct in the intelligence gathering during the origins of the Russia investigation.But despite the backlash from Democrats over his use of the term, Barr's testimony appeared to refer to intelligence collection that already has been widely reported and confirmed.Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrants against former Trump campaign aide Carter Page are currently the subject of a Justice Department inspector general investigation looking at potential misconduct in the issuance of those warrants.That review also reportedly is scrutinizing the role of an FBI informant who had contacts with Trump advisers in the early stages of the Russia investigation.TRUMP DEFENDS BARR, SAYS THERE 'ABSOLUTELY' WAS SPYING AGAINST HIS CAMPAIGN When asked about the controversy surrounding Barrs remarks, a person familiar with his thinking denied that he was trying to fuel conspiracy theories or play to the conservative base.When he used the word spying, he means intelligence collecting, the source told Fox News, also noting Barrs history as a CIA analyst in the 1970s.He wasnt using it in a pejorative sense, he was using it in the classic sense.The Oxford Dictionary defines spying as: to collect information about something to use in deciding how to act, or to observe furtively.The use of the term as it applies to the FBI's surveillance in 2016 has been fiercely disputed.The New York Times, even as it reported last year on how the FBI sent an informant to speak to campaign advisers amid concerns about suspicious Russia contacts, stated that this was to "investigate" Russia ties and "not to spy."But Barr's testimony suggests he makes no distinction between the two.He also stressed that the question for him is whether that "spying" was justified.I want to make sure there was no unauthorized surveillance, Barr said.President Trump defended the attorney general Thursday, saying that his statement was absolutely true.There was absolutely spying into my campaign, Trump said Thursday in the Oval Office.Ill go a step further and say it was illegal spying.Unprecedented spying.Meanwhile, Comey touted Barrs experience at the Justice Department.I think his career has earned him a presumption that he will be one of the rare Trump Cabinet members who will stand up for truth, Comey said.Language like this makes it harder, but I still think hes entitled to that presumption and because I dont understand what the heck hes talking about, thats all I can say.Whether proper or improper, the issue of surveillance of the Trump campaign has been widely documented.The FISA warrants, for example, were the subject of a GOP House Intelligence Committee memo last year.That memo alleged the unverified anti-Trump dossier provided much of the basis for law enforcement officials to repeatedly secure FISA warrants against Page, though Democrats have pushed back on parts of the GOP report.House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Devin Nunes, R-Calif., on Thursday notified Barr of criminal referrals related to the case alleging several "potential violations" of the law.In late 2015, early 2016, spying began on the Trump campaign, Nunes said on Hannity on Thursday.That information leaked, that led to what they considered to be legal spying that began, that they acknowledge they started doing at the end of July.He added, referring to Comey's memo-taking from high-level meetings: You have the culmination of the ultimate spying where you have the FBI director spying on the president, taking notes, illegally leaking those notes of classified information.Why?So they can appoint a special counsel to spy on an acting president again.So theres a lot of spying and a lot of leaking.Meanwhile, as part of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitzs investigation, he is reportedly probing the involvement of FBI informant Stefan Halperwhose role first emerged last year.During the 2016 campaign, Halper reportedly contacted several members of the Trump campaign, including former foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos and Page.Halper also reportedly contacted former campaign aide Sam Clovis.BARR REVEALS HE IS REVIEWING 'CONDUCT' OF FBI'S ORIGINAL RUSSIA PROBE Barr also testified this week that he is conducting a Justice Department review of the conduct of the original Russia investigation.[Im] trying to get my arms around all of the aspects of the counterintelligence investigation that was conducted in the summer of 2016, Barr said before the House Appropriations Committee Tuesday.Fox News' Jake Gibson and Gregg Re contributed to this report.

Pete Buttigieg: Mike Pence could end 'feuding' by opposing discrimination:::::Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, continuing his war-of-words with fellow Hoosier Mike Pence, said the vice president could "clear this up" by taking a broad stance against discrimination."I'm not interested in feuding with the vice president," Buttigieg said Thursday during a taping of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show.""But if he wanted to clear this up, he could come out today and say he's changed his mind, that it shouldn't be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are.That's all."Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, worked closely with Pence while Pence was governor.Since formally announcing his exploratory committee in late January, Buttigieg has rocketed to the upper tier of the Democratic presidential race.If successful, he would be the first openly gay nominee of a major party.The spat with the vice president began last weekend when Buttigieg critiqued Pence's record on LGBT equality during an event hosted by an activist group, and escalated on Wednesday when the vice president accused Buttigieg of attacking his Christian faith during an interview on CNBC."I'm not critical of his faith.I'm critical of bad policies," Buttigieg said Thursday."I don't have a problem with religion.I'm religious, too.I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people and especially in the LGBTQ community."In an interview that aired Friday with CNBC's John Harwood, Buttigieg described himself as "the only Maltese-American Episcopalian gay veteran that I know."Pence, in a CNN interview that also Friday, Pence said he considered Buttigieg a friend, and didn't "believe in discrimination against anybody.I treat everybody the way I want to be treated.""Pete has his convictions, I have mine," Pence said.Pence has long faced criticism from LGBT activists for his opposition to gay marriage and his support for legislation that his critics said targeted gays and lesbians.Pence has noted that as governor, he worked to implement the Supreme Court decision that made gay marriage the law of the land.
White House considered dumping migrants in 'sanctuary cities':::::Trump administration officials sought to bus detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities as a way to retaliate against the president's adversaries, two sources with knowledge of the discussions confirmed to NBC News on Friday.A former Department of Homeland Security official said the plan, first reported by The Washington Post, was ultimately scrapped when it was determined to be "so illegal."A White House official who also confirmed the broad outlines of the proposal pushed back on the idea that it was meant as retaliation for toward political rivals, however, calling that "absolutely ridiculous."DHS on Thursday night told NBC News the proposal had been "a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion."A White House official who confirmed the broad outlines of the proposal on Friday morning insisted the White House had never pressured Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop it, but simply floated the plan to officials at the agency.The official confirmed the idea came up twice initially as a query to ICE about the possibility, and later to inquire why it wouldn't be legally doable.Matthew Albence, who starts Friday as acting head of ICE, was involved in the assessment of the plan and the ultimate conclusion that it would not be feasible.The Post quoted DHS officials as saying the administration sought to release detainees in the San Francisco-based district of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and in other strongly Democratic districts.It said the White House told ICE that the plan was partly meant to conserve jail space but also partly to "send a message to Democrats."A source familiar with the plan told NBC News it was designed to "somehow hurt Pelosi."Another source, a former DHS official, told NBC News of the Trump administration's thinking: "Why release [migrants] into Yuma or Phoenix when you can release them in San Francisco where they want them?"That same official also said the plan was ultimately dropped when it was determined it was "so illegal.""The extent of this administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated," a spokeswoman for Pelosi told NBC News."Using human beings including little children as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable."The Post reported that two DHS whistleblowers independently reported the busing plan to Congress and that several DHS officials confirmed their accounts.Two DHS officials said Stephen Miller, a senior policy adviser who is widely reported to have assumed control of U.S. border policy, discussed the proposal with ICE, according to The Post."Sanctuary cities" is a term used to describe jurisdictions that limit or ban cooperation with federal immigration authorities.Trump has accused Democrats of trying to "turn America into one giant sanctuary city for violent criminals and MS-13 and other gang killers."
2020 candidate Pete Buttigieg on taxing the rich and the future of American capitalism:::::Pete Buttigieg: Yeah.It's pretty typical human behavior for people to try to make sure the rules work to their benefit.That's why the U.S. is based on the idea of a robust legal system and constraints on the excesses of anybody, especially concentrated wealth.And yet we're at this moment where concentrated wealth has begun to turn into concentrated power.More than begun.It's well underway.The thing that makes capitalism capitalism is competition.But as you have more and more corporate agglomerations of power, you're going to see less and less competition.John Harwood: Is that the reason why you think we have expanding income inequality?Pete Buttigieg: I think it's a vicious cycle.This didn't just happen.The economy is not some creature that just lumbers along on its own.It's an interaction between private sector and public sector.And public sector policies, for basically as long as I've been alive, have been skewed in a direction that's increasing inequality.And a lot of this is the consequence of what you might call the Reagan consensus.There was a period where even Democrats seemed to operate in this framework that assumes that the only thing you'd ever do with a tax is cut it.That those tax cuts were assumed to pay for themselves.The empirical collapse of that supply side consensus, I think, is one of the defining moments of this period that we're living through.John Harwood: Why do you ascribe it to the Reagan consensus as opposed to technological change, globalization, movement of capital?Pete Buttigieg: Well, all of these forces interact.But none of these forces automatically have to make our society more unequal.If anything, globalization was supposed to create more equality among nations.John Harwood: Well actually it has created more equality in the world.It's taken millions of people out of poverty.Pete Buttigieg: Sure, it's lifted so many out of poverty.And by the way, there are ways that it can work for us at home, too.But again, we're seeing a concentration of wealth and power that skews things in the opposite direction.The fundamental truth is, it turns out a rising tide does not lift all boats.Not on its own.Especially if some of the boats are sort of tethered to the ocean floor.And that's the kind of pattern that we've been on.John Harwood: So how do you fix what's wrong without slowing down or harming what's right?Pete Buttigieg: Well, first of all, we've got to define what success looks like.Is success just the number, the GDP?Or is success that more Americans are prospering?When you have that definition, it tells you that you have to rate these kind of exchanges between distribution and growth a little more evenly.John Harwood: So there's an efficiency-equity trade off, and you're willing to make it?Pete Buttigieg: There may be, yeah.I mean, look, it's great to say that it's all win/wins, and to some extent it is.I actually think an economy that's more equitable also tends to grow better.But if there's a win/lose equation, we shouldn't shy away from that.We shouldn't pretend that all of this stuff can be done that you can make everybody better off while making nobody worse off.The reality is there are some people who are not paying their share.There are some corporations that are not contributing the way that they should.Until we recalibrate that, until we invest in things like education and infrastructure and health, investments that do in fact pay for themselves overall, some people may have to pay more than others.Because some people frankly are getting a bit of a free ride on the productive energy of this country and this economy.John Harwood: Now, one thing that surprised me that you said in an interview the other day was that first of all, political change comes first.That is the set of issues, Supreme Court, filibuster, electoral college, because that is necessary to achieve policy changes that you need.But when you identified the most important policy change, it was climate, not the economy.Explain why that's the priority.Pete Buttigieg: Because I think climate is the biggest economic issue of our time, too.What kind of economy are we going to have if cities are becoming less and less inhabitable, if we're experiencing crop failures and heightening natural disasters?The problem with climate is it wrecks our chance at economic security as well as physical security.So, of course, we want to continue building an equitable and a growing economy.It's just that we can't do that if we're totally ignoring the biggest threat our economy has seen since the Great Depression.One reason you see traditionally conservative sectors like the military and like the business community way ahead of, for example, conservative politicians in this country on the issue of climate, is that the market, too, is beginning to recognize the stakes of failing to act and simply accepting what will eventually will be trillions of dollars in damage.It's not the planet as an abstraction that's going to be harmed.It's people.It's us.It's our economies, it's our societies, it's our communities.That's why this is such an urgent issue.John Harwood: You think we need to raise a lot more money for the government.What are the things that strike you as the most achievable and desirable?Pete Buttigieg: I think we certainly need to consider a higher marginal tax rate for top income earners.Maybe it doesn't have to be as high as it was historically, but we should at least admit that when it was higher, the American economy was growing pretty well.We should consider a wealth tax.I think it makes sense.I think one of the things that's appealing about it is it's not very distortionary compared to an income tax, and that's important.The least distortionary tax probably is the estate tax, because you're dead.We should think about turning to a more equitable use of the estate tax, especially for the biggest and wealthiest estates.I'm interested also if we could find the right way to implement it and the devil's in the details in a financial transactions tax.Because you see preposterous levels of wealth sometimes being created around these millisecond differences in financial transactions that nobody can explain to us whether it adds any actual real value to the economy.John Harwood: Even McKinsey can't explain whether that adds real value?Pete Buttigieg: Even McKinsey, as far as I know.Look, the downside of any tax is it can disincentivize economic activity.So let's start by taxing by the economic activity whose value is hardest to prove.John Harwood: Warren's wealth tax would raise something on the order of $2.7 trillion over 10 years.Is that the order of magnitude you're talking about?Pete Buttigieg: Probably.I mean, look, we had something on the order of a trillion dollars robbed from the Treasury through the Trump tax cuts on the wealthiest.So even just getting us closer to being able to cover the deficit, with the services Americans count on today, is going to take us filling in a gap of that size.If we want to do more if we want to have better infrastructure, which we absolutely need; if we want to deal with climate change, which is no longer optional; if we want to actually deliver on health care; if we want to continue to grow as the kind of country that can actually lead the world then you don't get something for nothing.John Harwood: Can you do everything that you think needs to be done while hitting only the wealthy?Or is there no rational plan for dealing with our fiscal challenges, as well as our economic challenges, that doesn't also hit the middle class?Pete Buttigieg: If we're going to collect revenue from the middle class, then we have to be certain that it is going to be reinvested and returned to the middle class in a way that makes us and the middle class better off.So as a middle class taxpayer, I don't mind paying a certain amount in if it's going to come back to me in the form of health care, if it's going to come back to me in the form of education for my kids, if it's going to come back to me in the form of a better road to get me to my job.John Harwood: How powerful is a racial consideration when you think about the scale of things that need to be done for the entire country?Pete Buttigieg: We know that if we target inequality in this country, much of which arose not by accident but by deliberate racist policies, and they can perhaps be reversed with intentional anti-racist policies, that we're benefiting the entire society.We all do better when we all do better, as Senator [Paul] Wellstone said.We need to consider, first of all, that it's the right thing to do.Secondly, that this is not a favor to somebody, this is a restoration of a theft.And third, that if we get it right, you don't have to be somebody who is on the wrong side of a racial inequity to be better off for living in a country that did something about it.John Harwood: Jamie Dimon recently put out a letter to J.P. Morgan that said, "The social needs of too many citizens have not been met."But he also says that tax cut that was enacted late 2017 was the irreducible minimum of what we needed to turn our economy around.What would you say to him?Pete Buttigieg: The big problem in this country was not that it was too difficult to be wealthy.It just isn't the big problem in our country right now.It's not what led to the political instability we're seeing.It's not what's leading to diminished life expectancy, or the prospect of my generation is going to be the first in history to be worse off economically than our parents.What we could've done, especially if we were going to create a trillion-dollar deficit, is make the kinds of investments in infrastructure and education and health that would have made this whole country better off.I also think that, no matter how educated or intelligent some of the people working in these industries are, they can quickly get out of touch with the reality on the ground.If you don't understand just how much anger there is in, for example, my part of the industrial Midwest where it can be used in a very cynical political way to direct it against immigrants, or trade writ large, or against your fellow American, or even against Democrats, just because folks are mad and it's got to go somewhere you're going to continue to see these destabilizing political outcomes like what we're living through right now.John Harwood: Others say that the kinds of things you're talking about would be destructive of capitalism, that it's a war on the wealthy, that it would bring socialism to the United States.How how do you respond to arguments like that?Pete Buttigieg: The crazy thing about arguments like that is how uncoupled they are from evidence.We don't have to speculate on what happens in a Western society that delivers health care to everybody, or that has more social mobility or that invests at a higher rate in infrastructure or education.We know exactly what happens.What happens is you're better off.The American dream is slipping away.You're much more likely to experience that if you're a kid in Denmark right now than if you're in America.And while people can think up all kinds of excuses why something that worked in other societies hasn't worked here, the reality is, when we've tried it here in our history, it's also served us pretty well.John Harwood: When it comes to cultural conservatives, you have said that progressives need to be mindful of the distance they have to travel, be sensitive to that.Do you think progressives also need to be mindful of the distance that some in business have to travel, when they think 'hey, they're coming after me?'Pete Buttigieg: I think a lot of this is tonal.Look, the one thing I learned in the business community, and even more as a mayor engaging the business community, is that while we'd like to think of businesses as the most numbers-driven kind of discipline in America, in my experience it's one of the most emotional.So what's really important is that people not feel that they're being attacked or at least they understand that if we're attacking a certain way of doing things, or a certain system, that this is not motivated by just angsty hatred.It's being motivated by serious and legitimate concerns about where we're headed.John Harwood: We have seen in the last 10 to 15 years astonishing change in terms of cultural attitudes on issues like same sex marriage.Do you have any degree of expectation that we're going to see very fast changes of opinion on economic issues?Pete Buttigieg: I think there is a tectonic change in economic policy.You can see it by the fact that the Republican Party experienced a hostile takeover on the part of, basically, economic populists.This is not just another four-year cycle.This is not just another election, and I don't just mean because of the character, or personality of the president.I believe we're living through one of those moments just as when the New Deal consensus gave way to the Reagan consensus.We're living through the end of a 30- or 40-year era that defined American politics and helped to explain how Democrats as well as Republicans behaved in office.We're at the dawn of a new one.We've got to make sure we have an account of economic change, as well as social, and political structures to handle that change, especially in the new machine age with automation transforming our relationship to the workforce.We've got to have answers that go a lot further than just saying "the current guy's rotten and we ought to throw him out."
Fourth GOP senator opposes Herman Cain for Fed board:::::Opposition from Cramer could also leave a Cain nomination deadlocked in the Senate Banking Committee, before it even reached the floor of the Senate for a vote.The news of Cramer's opposition came as White House support for Cain also seemed to weaken on Thursday."Yes, we are, at the moment," National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow replied when asked during an event in Washington about whether the White House still stood behind Cain, a former pizza executive and 2012 Republican presidential candidate.Kudlow is a former CNBC contributor."He's in the vetting process, we will see how that turns out," Kudlow added."I don't want to prejudge it one way or the other."A former 2012 GOP presidential candidate, Cain suspended his primary campaign in December 2011 after it emerged that three women had accused him of workplace sexual harassment, a fourth woman accused him of sexual assault, and a fifth woman came forward to allege that she and Cain had carried out a 13-year-long extramarital affair.Cain has denied all the allegations.Still, the prospect of revisiting the allegations during a heated Senate confirmation hearing, and having to publicly defend Cain, likely holds little appeal for the White House or for Republican senators in swing states.WATCH: Senate should look at Fed nominees' prior statements
Obama White House counsel Greg Craig charged with lying to prosecutors about foreign lobbying:::::Anticipating the DOJ's announcement, Craig's attorneys said in a statement to news outlets that their client's case had already been referred to federal authorities in the Southern District of New York who did not bring charges.After the indictment was announced, Craig's lawyers said "it is itself unfair and misleading" and "ignores uncontroverted evidence to the contrary.""Mr. Craig had no interest in misleading the FARA Unit because he had not done anything that required his registration.That is what this trial will be all about," his representatives said.Craig is charged with lying during an Oct. 19, 2017, interview with the special counsel's office about the nature of work he did for the Ukrainian government in 2012 and 2013, while he was a senior partner at the law firm Skadden Arps.Craig left the firm in April of 2018.Skadden was originally hired in 2012 by the government of then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich, a Kremlin ally, to prepare a formal report effectively justifying Yanukovich's decision to prosecute and imprison his political rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, a former prime minister.The prosecution of Tymoshenko caused international outrage at the time, and the Yanukovich government was eager for a Western law firm with a sterling reputation like Skadden to produce a report which it could share internationally, in an attempt to relieve some of the pressure it had come under from human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations.In 2012 and 2013, while Skadden was working for the Yanukovich government, the Justice Department approached the firm to inquire whether the work constituted foreign lobbying, which would require that Skadden register as an agent of the Ukrainian government under FARA.According to the indictment, in February 2012 Craig emailed a law firm partner and said, "I don't want to register as a foreign agent under FARA.I think we don't have to with this assignment, yes?"
3 big tax planning takeaways from Sen. Elizabeth Warren's 2018 return:::::Say what you will about presidential hopeful Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., but it looks like she's getting some good tax advice.Warren released her 2018 tax return Wednesday.She filed jointly with her husband Bruce H. Mann, a professor at Harvard Law School.The two reported total income of $905,742 and paid total taxes of $230,965, according to the return.The couple didn't get a refund.Rather, they owed the IRS $24,477 in taxes.They weren't on the hook for underpayment penalties."I don't think there's anything wrong with her owing," said Tim Steffen, CPA and director of advanced planning at Robert W. Baird & Co. "She makes estimated tax payments throughout the year, and we tell people that this makes the most sense there are no penalties there."Here are a few tax planning takeaways from the senator's 2018 return.
The Assange indictment shows how hard it is to protect classified information in the modern era:::::The indictment describes a relationship that ran from January to May 2010.During that time, Chelsea Manning, an Army intelligence analyst then known as Bradley Manning, sent "nearly complete" databases from U.S. government agencies to Wikileaks at Assange's request.The data included 90,000 Afghan war reports, 400,000 Iraq war reports, 800 assessment briefs of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and 250,000 diplomatic cables.Assange also allegedly provided support to Manning, and encouraged her to keep leaking terabytes of information even after she said she couldn't access any more.Assange is alleged to have helped Manning break a password associated with the U.S. government's Secret Internet Protocol Network, encouraged Manning to provide various records and information from several different departments and helped Manning conceal her identity while doing it.The indictment also outlines an alleged "password cracking agreement," in which Assange helped Manning find sensitive passwords and attempt to crack them, in order to give her greater access to classified information.For this, Manning used a Linux-based software tool, the Justice Department alleges, though it's unclear where Manning obtained the software.These are the basis of charges that Assange conspired to hack government computers and steal classified information.Assange also allegedly pushed Manning for more information."After this upload, that's all I really have got left," Manning allegedly said in early 2010 after the initial leaks."Curious eyes never run dry in my experience," Assange replied, according to the indictment.The army arrested Manning for the leaks in July 2010.Wikileaks publicly released the data starting later that year.Assange used the diplomatic cables to take U.S. government officials and media outlets on a months-long ride, involving promises of massive file dumps, allegedly damaging data held as "insurance," and various other teases throughout 2010.The data dumps provided Wikileaks with significant media attention and caused diplomatic headaches and long-lasting repercussions in the relationships between the U.S. and its European allies.Manning has said she leaked the information to Wikileaks because of grave concerns that media and government portrayals of success in Iraq and Afghanistan were a stark contrast to the starker, uglier reality she had been observing in her Army role.At her sentencing in August 2013, she said, "When I made these decisions I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people.At the time of my decisions I was dealing with a lot of issues."She was sentenced to 35 years in prison.Throughout her court martial, Manning was often described by her attorneys as "emotionally fragile," and she said she became involved with Wikileaks staffers because they sympathized with her personally and made her feel like she could "be myself."Manning has so far fought a subpoena to testify in the case against Assange.
Trump is standing behind controversial Fed board pick Herman Cain 'at the moment,' Larry Kudlow says:::::WASHINGTON White House support for Herman Cain, one of President Donald Trump's controversial Federal Reserve Board picks, seemed to weaken Thursday, when Trump's top economic advisor Thursday pointedly declined to give Cain a full-throated endorsement."Yes, we are, at the moment," National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow replied when asked during an event in Washington about whether the White House still stood behind Cain, a former pizza executive and 2012 Republican presidential candidate."He's in the vetting process, we will see how that turns out," Kudlow added."I don't want to prejudge it one way or the other."Kudlow's hands-off attitude about the nomination is a stark departure from the traditional role played by White House officials after the president announces his intent to nominate someone to a post like the Fed board, which requires Senate confirmation.Kudlow is a former CNBC contributor.In most cases, White House officials are expected to act as front-line cheerleaders for the president's picks, making the case to both the Senate and the public that the president's choice was a good pick.But Cain does not fit the mold of a traditional nominee to the Federal Reserve Board.Although Trump has yet to submit formal nomination papers for him, Cain's chances of winning Senate confirmation have grown slimmer by the day since Trump announced his selection last Thursday.At least three Republican senators confirmed this week that they would not vote to confirm him to the post: Sens.Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Cory Gardner of Colorado, and newly minted Utah Sen. Mitt Romney.There are also concerns among lawmakers and on Wall Street about Trump's other contentious pick for the Fed board, conservative political activist and economics writer Stephen Moore.It is unclear whether Republican senators will vote against Moore, who has had to contend with claims that he is unqualified for the Fed role as well as revelations about his messy divorce.Moore advised Trump during his 2016 campaign and co-authored a 2018 book called "Trumponomics: Inside the America First Plan to Revive Our Economy."
Mike Pence says the American dream was 'dying' before Trump became president:::::Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday that the American dream was "dying until President Donald Trump was inaugurated" in 2017."Was the American dream in trouble?You bet," Pence said in an interview with CNBC's Joe Kernan on "Squawk Box" Thursday morning."I really do believe that's why the American people chose a president whose family lived the American dream and was willing to go in and fight to make the American dream available for every American."Pence told Kernan that before Trump became president, trade deals pushed car manufacturers out of the country, something he saw while serving as Indiana's governor, but Trump fought "for trade deals that put American jobs and American workers first."Some manufacturers have expanded in the U.S. since Trump began his term in the Oval Office.In February, Ford announced plans to invest $1 billion and add jobs at its Chicago factories as it makes cuts overseas.A Toyota and Mazda joint venture in 2018 broke ground on a $1.6 billion assembly plant in Alabama that is expected to open in 2021 and employ 4,000 people.However, others aren't faring as well.General Motors shut down a decades-old factory in Lordstown, Ohio, in March, leaving thousands of workers in search of new jobs.Though the Trump administration had success in boosting manufacturing jobs, many feel the American dream still faces challenges, according to a February poll by RealClearPolitics.Some 37% of the poll's voters said the American dream is alive, but under threat; 28% said it's under serious threat, but that there's still hope; 7% said it is dead; and 27% said it is alive and well.But Pence said the American dream is recovering.Trump's policies are generating jobs and raising wages "at the fastest pace of all," he said, which "gives evidence of the fact that the American dream is coming back.People are seeing opportunity open up.Small business confidence at record highs, according to the NFIB."Indeed, the small business association's optimism survey hit a 45-year high in August and has remained strong, the group said in recent press releases.Pence's comments come as a number of U.S. billionaires and business leaders call for fixes to America's system of capitalism.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, J.P. Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio and Microsoft founder Bill Gates who are some of the wealthiest people in the country have said the current economic system contributes to income inequality.In a letter to shareholders last week, Dimon wrote he was exasperated by the growing inequality in the U.S.He recommended higher taxes on America's wealthiest citizens."If that happens, the wealthy should remember that if we improve our society and our economy, then they, in effect, are among the main winners," Dimon said.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.
'The worst, ill-suited appointments': Pelosi slams Trump's Fed picks Herman Cain and Stephen Moore:::::House Democratic leadership slammed President Donald Trump's nominees for the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, calling them unqualified and dangerous.Speaking to reporters at a private lawmakers' retreat, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called conservative commentator Stephen Moore and businessman Herman Cain "the worst, ill-suited appointments that the president could come up with.""The Fed should be determining the rates, not any politicians," Pelosi said."That is a dangerous thing for an economy, when a central bank of the country has political influence.It's wrong."In an interview with CNBC, Vice President Mike Pence said Cain and Moore share Trump's philosophy for the economy and the direction of interest rates.Pelosi questioned whether that could mean the administration would meddle in the Fed's decisions.Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries predicted that the White House would eventually withdraw the nominations.Trump has said he wants to appoint Cain and Moore to the Board of Governors but has not yet submitted official paperwork.Cain abandoned his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 amid allegations of sexual harassment.Moore who has argued for an immediate cut to the Fed's benchmark interest rate is in a dispute with the IRS over $75,000 in unpaid taxes."It's not clear to me whether that's reality or a 'Saturday Night Live' skit," Jeffries told reporters at the retreat."It's an embarrassment."Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will speak Thursday night at the retreat.Democrats invited him to attend, and Pelosi said that his appearance would not further politicize the central bank.A few weeks ago, Powell spoke with about 50 House Republicans at the request of Minority Whip Steve Scalise."He's not a political person in any way," Pelosi said.She also expressed faith in his ability to maintain the Fed's independence."Thank God Chairman Powell is there," she said."But for him to have to deal with a politically motivated Fed there are so many bridges too far.But this is a really dangerous one."
Michael Avenatti is expected to be indicted by federal grand jury in LA:::::Celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti was slammed Thursday with a 36-count indictment by a federal grand jury in California that accuses him of ripping off clients including a mentally ill paraplegic for millions of dollars, shorting the IRS of millions more, swiping millions of dollars in employment taxes from his coffee company, and perjury.The indictment comes more than two weeks after federal prosecutors in Los Angeles and New York hit the 48-year-old Avenatti with separate criminal complaints.And it comes more than a year after the hyper-aggressive litigator first gained widespread notoriety for his representation of porn star Stormy Daniels in her legal tussles with President Donald Trump and his former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen.U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna of Los Angeles said that Avenatti's allegedly criminal conduct spanned four distinct areas, which "are all linked to one another because money generated from one set of crimes appears in other sets typically in the form of payments to lull victims and to prevent Mr. Avenatti's financial house of cards from collapsing."Ryan Korner, head of IRS criminal tax probes in Los Angeles, said that the money stolen by Avenatti through "a tangled financial web of lies" was "used to fund a lavish lifestyle which had no limits."Korner said that IRS investigators started investigating Avenatti more than a year ago, but also said that Avenatti "began to run afoul of the IRS almost a decade ago" by failing to file income tax returns.In the case in New York, Avenatti is accused of trying to extort up to $25 million from athletic shoe giant Nike by threatening to expose alleged bribery of amateur basketball players and their families unless the company coughed up cash to Avenatti and a client.If convicted in the new California case, Avenatti faces a maximum possible sentence of 333 years in prison.Reached for comment, Avenatti told CNBC in a text message, "For 20 years I have represented Davids vs. Goliaths and relied on due process and our system of justice.""Along the way, I have made many powerful enemies.I am entitled to a FULL presumption of innocence and am confident that justice will be done once ALL of the facts are known," Avenatti added.In a subsequent tweet, Avenatti said, "I intend to fully fight all charges and plead NOT GUILTY.I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me."In another tweet, he wrote, "Any claim that any monies due clients were mishandled is bogus nonsense."The new, 61-page indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California in Santa Ana alleges that Avenatti for years hid and then completely spent a $4 million legal settlement obtained in January 2015 in favor of a mentally ill paraplegic client, and hid a $2.75 million settlement for another client that Aventatti allegedly used to help pay for his share of the purchase of a private jet valued at up to $5 million.That jet was seized by federal authorities on Wednesday.Most of the money for the paraplegic client, Geoffrey Ernest Johnson, allegedly was funnelled to a company that managed Avenatti's race-car team, and to his coffee company, Global Baristas, which operated the Tully's chain.The indictment says that because Avenatti failed to respond to the U.S. Social Security Administration's request for information about his client, Johnson had his Supplemental Security Income benefits discontinued in February.In all, five clients were allegedly ripped off for millions of dollars by Avenatti, who also is accused of using shell companies and other means to hide the purported thefts.The grand jury said Avenatti "would misrepresent, conceal, and falsely describe to the clients the true terms of" the more than $12 million in settlements that he had obtained for them in their civil cases.And he would also allegedly lie to the clients by saying the settlements had not yet been paid, or that they were delayed for legitimate reasons.The indictment said that in some cases, such as with Johnson, Avenatti would give a client funds which he claimed were "advances" on the "the purportedly yet-to-be received settlement proceeds."Avenatti also is accused in the indictment of taking almost $2.4 million in employment taxes withheld from the paychecks of workers at Global Baristas.And the indictment says that the last time he filed his federal income tax return was in 2011 for the 2010 filing year, and that he has also failed to file tax returns for his law firm.Prosecutors said Avenatti failed to pay millions of dollars of taxes due the IRS.In all, Avenatti is charged with 10 counts of wire fraud, 19 tax-related offenses, two counts of bank fraud, and four counts of bankruptcy fraud.The bankruptcy counts relate to allegedly false statements that Avenatti filed in connection with the bankruptcy of his law firm Eagan Avenatti.Federal prosecutors in L.A. accused him in their prior complaint of defrauding a legal client by looting a $1.6 million civil settlement for that man to pay for Avenatti's personal and business expenses.He was also accused in that case of defrauding a Mississippi bank by using bogus federal income tax returns to apply for and receive $4 million in loans.The allegations in that complaint are restated in the indictment unsealed Thursday.Josh Robbins, a lawyer for Avenatti's client Johnson, said in a statement: "Mr. Johnson is the victim of an appalling fraud perpetrated by the one person who owed him loyalty and honesty most of all: his own lawyer.""Mr. Avenatti stole millions of dollars that were meant to compensate Mr. Johnson for a devastating injury, spent it on his own lavish lifestyle, then lied about it to Mr. Johnson for years to cover his tracks," Robbins said."His actions have left Mr. Johnson destitute.Mr. Johnson is cooperating fully with the government's investigation, and hopes that justice will be done in this case."Robbins, who previously was a prosecutor in the same office that has charged Avenatti, told CNBC that the case against him is "pretty damning.""It's going to be a pretty difficult case for him to defend," Robbins said.
US charges WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange with conspiracy to commit computer hacking:::::The Justice Department announced a criminal charge Thursday against WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange, accusing him of conspiring with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to hack into a classified U.S. government computer."The charge relates to Assange's alleged role in one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States," the Justice Department said in a press release.The announcement followed an extradition request by the U.S. for Assange, 47, who on Thursday morning was arrested and removed from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has lived for nearly seven years.A British judge said Thursday that the U.S. must share its case justifying Assange's extradition by June 12, multiple outlets reported.If convicted, Assange could face five years in prison, though his actual sentence would likely fall below the legal maximum.CNN reported, however, that Justice Department officials expect to bring additional charges against Assange."This is a dark day for journalism," a representative for Assange said outside British court."We don't want this to go forward.This has to be averted.""It's called conspiracy.It's conspiracy to commit journalism," the representative continued, adding: "There is no assurance that there will not be additional charges when he is on U.S.soil."
Elizabeth Warren targets corporate profits with new 7% surtax proposal:::::Elizabeth Warren, the economic policy pacesetter in the Democratic presidential primary field, wants to raise $1 trillion in government revenue from a new 7% surtax on profits of the largest corporations.What the Massachusetts senator dubs the "Real Corporate Profits Tax" would apply to worldwide profits exceeding $100 million.The purpose, she says, is to bolster government coffers by preventing corporate giants from exploiting loopholes to avoid federal taxation following the large tax cut enacted by President Donald Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress in December 2017."It will make our biggest and most profitable corporations pay more and ensure that none of them can ever make billions and pay zero taxes again," Warren wrote in a Medium post published Thursday morning."To raise the revenue we need and ensure every corporation pays their fair share we need a new kind of tax that big companies can't get around."The Trump tax cut, following entreaties from corporations for a more globally competitive U.S. system, reduced the top corporate rate to 21% from 35%.But deductions remaining in the IRS code allow some large corporations to reduce their effective rates far below that in some cases all the way to zero.Read more: Elizabeth Warren's 2020 campaign raises $6 million in the first quarter Watch: How Amazon paid $0 federal income tax in 2018
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to meet Democrats amid Trump pressure:::::Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will meet with Democratic lawmakers at their annual policy retreat Thursday night as the central bank faces renewed political pressure from the Trump White House.Democrats invited Powell to the meeting as part of an effort to focus their agenda on kitchen table issues such as the economy and health care, rather than investigations and court battles.But top lawmakers also said they are growing increasingly worried about the politicization of the Fed, from President Donald Trump's criticism of the chairman to his intended nominees for the central bank's board of governors."I personally am very concerned about the independence of the Federal Reserve generally and the independence of its members specifically," said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.In interviews, several Democratic lawmakers said they are looking to Powell for guidance on the strength of the job market and the direction of the economy.Other topics they hope to cover include income inequality, trade tensions and the impact of the GOP tax cuts."I know the economy is working well for lots of people, but for many people in my district, it is not working well," said Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala. "I just want to hear from him as to why we see that variation."But Democrats also pointed to Trump's plans to nominate conservative commentator Stephen Moore and former Republican presidential candidate and businessman Hermain Cain to the Fed's board as signs of potential cracks in the central bank's independence.Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York said he is seeking reassurance that Powell can withstand the onslaught of criticism coming from the Oval Office."I want to know from him whether he's really feeling the pressure from the administration in regards to the interest rates," he said."Is he free to do what he thinks is an appropriate thing in an independent manner?"Trump has lashed out at the Fed for raising its benchmark interest rate last year and has repeatedly cast the central bank as a potential impediment to economic growth.His nominees have also questioned the need for rate hikes, and Moore has even called for an immediate rate cut of half of a percentage point.The Fed declined to comment for this story.But previous Fed chairmen have met privately with the Democratic and Republican caucuses, though none has attended the parties' policy retreats.Most recently, Powell spoke to about 50 GOP lawmakers at the invitation of House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.. Because Congress created the central bank more than a century ago, the Fed's independence ultimately depends on lawmakers' confidence in its leaders, said David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center for Fiscal and Monetary Policy."Any Fed chair would avoid the appearance of partisanship and should accept invitations from both Democrats and Republicans, as I believe Mr. Powell has done," Wessel said."These days, it seems to be hard for Democrats and Republicans to have civil conversations in the same room, so the Fed may need to see them separately."Powell has worked assiduously to cultivate relationships on Capitol HIll on both sides of the aisle, packing in as many as six meetings in one day.He was spotted in the basement of the Senate one evening, shortly after Trump announced he planned to nominate Moore as a Fed governor.His cameo at the retreat is not considered an official appearance: It is not on the Fed's schedule of public events, and no text or video of his comments will be released.Instead, it is being treated as an informal discussion with lawmakers.Other high-profile speakers at the retreat include celebrity couple John Legend and Chrissy Teigen and Kaiser Permanente Chief Executive Bernard Tyson."I'm a supporter of Powell and the independence of the Fed," said Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee."I think he's been a mainstream Fed chairman, and I think the idea there ought to be a Democratic Fed or a Republican Fed is bad policy."WATCH: Mnuchin on Fed chair Powell: I don't feel like I picked the wrong person
EU leaders, UK agree to extend Brexit deadline until the end of October:::::European Union leaders and the U.K. government have agreed to a "flexible extension" of the Brexit deadline until Oct. 31.Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said this development provides an "additional six months for the UK to find the best possible solution."The emergency summit was convened after Prime Minister Theresa May requested a further delay to the U.K.'s departure from the bloc.She was forced to ask for more time after U.K. lawmakers rejected the Brexit deal she struck with the EU last year in three parliamentary votes on the agreement.Members of Parliament (MPs) have also failed to reach a majority in support of alternative options, however.May has been holding talks with opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the hope that a compromise or alternative plan can be found, but this has so far proved elusive.After two years of Brexit negotiations, the U.K. was meant to leave the EU on March 29.With Parliament not backing the deal on offer, the government asked for a short delay to April 12 in order to get backing for an alternative Brexit strategy.As that has failed to materialize, May was forced last week to ask for a longer delay to June 30 in order to prevent the U.K. leaving the bloc without a deal.The EU had already warned that a longer delay would mean that it has to take part in European Parliament elections in late May.The U.K. would have to take part in those elections and vote on representatives to the European Parliament.Those members would stop working for the EU on the day the U.K. leaves the bloc.A source familiar with the negotiations told CNBC that France was the toughest to convince.Diplomatic sources told Reuters that French President Emmanuel Macron said a delay beyond June 30 would undermine the bloc.Some diplomats expressed frustration with his stance, suggesting that Paris was adding more uncertainty to the summit.WATCH: Niall Ferguson: Brexit has turned into a student asking for a paper extension
Mike Pence says Pete Buttigieg 'knows better' after criticism:::::Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday that Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg "knows better" days after the South Bend, Indiana, mayor made waves by critiquing Pence's record on LGBT equality."He said some things that are critical of my Christian faith and about me personally.And he knows better.He knows me," said Pence, who served as governor of Indiana when Buttigieg came out as gay during his reelection campaign for mayor.The vice president's comments came during an interview with Joe Kernen on CNBC's "Squawk Box" that will air at 6 a.m.ET on Thursday morning."But I get it.You know, it's look, again, 19 people running for president on that side in a party that's sliding off to the left.And they're all competing with one another for how much more liberal they are," Pence said.Pence was responding to comments that Buttigieg, who is expected to officially launch his campaign for president Sunday, made over the weekend during an event hosted by the LGBTQ Victory Fund."I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand, that if you have a problem with who I am, your quarrel is not with me," Buttigieg said."Your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."Buttigieg has skyrocketed to the front of the Democratic pack since announcing the formation of an exploratory committee in late January.Buttigieg, an Afghanistan war veteran, has said that his marriage to his husband has brought him closer to God.Pence has faced scrutiny from LGBT activist groups over his opposition to gay marriage and his support, while governor, for a "religious freedom" bill that opponents said targeted gays and lesbians.Business groups including the Indiana Chamber of Commerce had opposed the measure.Pence signed the bill shortly before Buttigieg came out.The former governor, who President Donald Trump once reportedly joked "wants to hang them all," referring to gay people, said Wednesday that he stood by his view of marriage."But that doesn't mean that we're critical of anyone else who has a different point of view," he said.Pence said that as governor, he "worked very closely with Mayor Pete" and that they "had a great working relationship."He noted that, as governor of Indiana, he implemented the Supreme Court's decision that made gay marriage the law of the land.When reached for comment on Pence's remarks, a representative for Buttigieg's campaign referred CNBC to the candidate's previous statements.Buttigieg, apparently responding to similar comments that Pence made in 2015, wrote in a post on Twitter this week that people "will often be polite to you in person, while advancing policies that harm you and your family.""You will be polite to them in turn, but you need not stand for such harms.Instead, you push back, honestly and emphatically.So it goes, in the public square," Buttigieg wrote.Read the full exchange:
Vice President Mike Pence backs Trump's call to lower interest rates, citing low consumer inflation:::::Vice President Mike Pence said that despite his bullish view of the state of the economy, he backs the president's calls for further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.The comments came in response to a question from CNBC's Joe Kernen and will air 6 a.m.ET Thursday on "Squawk Box.""If things are so great, I don't understand ... At this point, people say we don't have dry powder for the next slowdown.Why would we cut rates again?"Kernen asked."Well, you saw the consumer numbers that came out yesterday, though, Joe.I mean, there's no evidence of inflation in this economy," Pence responded.In the 12-month period through March, consumer prices rose just under the Fed's inflation target of 2%, according to government figures released Wednesday.The Fed tracks a different benchmark, which also remains under 2%.President Donald Trump and top economic advisor Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, have also called on the Fed to cut rates, though the central bank's decisions are generally made independently of political demands.The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, held in March, show that most Fed officials expect the benchmark rate to be left unchanged this year, though some noted that it "could shift in either direction" depending on economic conditions.Pence said Wednesday that "this is a president that really does believe that this economy's only starting to grow.""You look at nations around the world, nations that we compete with every day.And the president really does believe that 3% is a starting point in this economy," he said.
Nancy Pelosi: 'I don't trust Barr; I trust Mueller':::::House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday she doesn't trust Attorney General William Barr and suggested his statements alleging President Donald Trump's campaign was spied on undermine Barr's independence as the nation's top law enforcement officer.The California Democrat also said in an interview with The Associated Press she was "very concerned" about Barr's handling of special counsel Robert Mueller's Trump-Russia report and accused Barr doing Trump's political bidding."He is not the attorney general of Donald Trump.He is the attorney general of the United States," Pelosi told AP."I don't trust Barr, I trust Mueller."Barr testified Wednesday before a Senate panel that he believes "spying did occur" on Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, aligning himself more closely with the president's views on the origins of the Russia investigation.Critics of the Russia probe note that it was launched during the Obama administration, though Mueller was appointed special counsel by Trump's Justice Department.Pelosi said Barr's comments undermine the Constitution and his role in the Justice Department.Barr said Wednesday he expects to release a redacted version of the Mueller report next week, but Pelosi said it's only a "matter of time" before the full report is made public."We will see it," she said.As House Democrats pursue oversight of the Trump administration beyond the Mueller probe, Trump has complained that Democrats will never be satisfied.He and his allies call it presidential harassment.Asked what would satisfy Democrats, Pelosi said: "I'll be satisfied when we have a new president of the United States who is a Democrat."While some Democrats support pursuing impeachment proceedings against the president, however, Pelosi has kept them at a distance.She recently brushed off impeachment calls, saying Trump's just not "worth it."But that was before Barr released his four-page analysis of Mueller's report, which said the president was not exonerated by the special counsel.Mueller left open the question of whether Trump obstructed justice during the two-year probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.Barr and his team at the Justice Department made their own decision to clear the president of criminal wrongdoing.Asked if she still thought Trump was not worth impeachment, Pelosi said to wait and see the full report."My view is that impeachment is very divisive in the country, and when we see what we need to see it may be imperative that he be impeached.But up until then, he's not worth it," Pelosi said.She said again, "Let us see the report."As the new Congress rounds out its first 100 days, the speaker said Democrats are doing far more than conducting oversight of the White House, even though she said that's their constitutional responsibility as an equal branch of government.She said she prefers to keep the House focused on pocketbook issues for everyday Americans -- lowering health care costs and investing in infrastructure and new ethics rules."We are not just focusing on him," she said."We're focused on what we said we would do."
Trump says he will have to send more troops to the US-Mexico border:::::President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will have to direct more American troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, after his supporters shared graphic stories about illegal immigration during a meeting in San Antonio."I'm going to have to call up more military," said Trump, who was flanked at the roundtable event by a small group of local officials and ranchers.Trump has sent thousands of troops to the border before.In early February, the Pentagon announced a deployment of about 3,750 active-duty troops less than two weeks before the president declared that the situation at the southern border constituted a national emergency.Trump also lashed out at media outlets who have refused to count the construction of replacement barrier along the border as "new" sections of his long-promised wall."I ripped down a wall" that was "useless, and we built a new one," Trump said."Some of them said we didn't build a wall ... what they don't say is that we ripped it down" because "it was garbage."Trump told the reporters, "You're dishonest people, many of you."The roundtable was part of two scheduled fundraising events in Texas one in San Antonio and the other in Houston.Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told reporters earlier Wednesday that she expected Trump's reelection campaign would raise at least $6 million from the two events alone.Trump did not elaborate on when he would send more military personnel to the border, or how many he planned to deploy.The White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's questions about the president's remarks.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Trump relayed to the media some of the anecdotes he had been told about the danger on the border."We start talking and the first person gets up and says, 'Sir, we have many people dying.Coming across the border,'" Trump said."'They'll be dropped off and they start walking and they'll say Houston's right down the road.But it's actually 300 miles away.And we find dead people from Guatemala, from Honduras, from El Salvador, From Mexico.All over.'"The president also said that the troops sent to the border have to use more restraint than they otherwise would."Our military, don't forget, can't act like a military would act.Because if they got a little rough, everybody would go crazy," Trump said."They have all these horrible laws that the Democrats won't change, they will not change them.And I think they will pay a very big price in 2020 for all of the things, whether it is the fake witch hunt they start out, or whether it is a situation like this.I think the border is going to be an incredible issue," Trump said.CNBC's Amanda Macias contributed to this report.
Herman Cain's Fed board bid is in danger as three GOP senators plan to vote against Trump's pick:::::Herman Cain's path to the Federal Reserve Board could get blocked before President Donald Trump even nominates him.At least three GOP senators plan to vote against the former Godfather's Pizza CEO and Kansas City Fed chairman if Trump formally chooses him for the central bank seat, according to multiple reports.If Cain loses one more Republican and all Democrats oppose him as expected, his path to the Fed board would be blocked.Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, expects to oppose Cain's nomination if it comes before the Senate, a spokeswoman for the Romney confirmed.Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, has said she will not support Cain for the Fed seat, according to a spokeswoman for Murkowski.Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., also reportedly plans to vote against Cain, who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2012.A spokesman for Gardner did not immediately respond to CNBC's request to comment.
Elizabeth Warren says her campaign raised $6 million in first quarter:::::Sen. Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign said on Wednesday that it raised $6 million from 135,000 donors in the first quarter, a haul that falls behind those of her major rivals.The announcement comes amid reports that the progressive Massachusetts Democrat is struggling to raise money after shunning traditional sources of big dollar donations.The average donation was $28, Warren's campaign said.In total, the candidate received 213,000 donations.The campaign said that 99% of donations were $200 or less.The $6 million, raised between her launch at the start of the year and April, puts Warren behind at least four of her fellow Democrats, despite being the first major candidate to enter into the race.That said, Warren does have an advantage over some in the race in that she transferred $10 million from her campaign for the Senate that she can use for her presidential campaign.The campaign said that it had $11.2 million in cash on hand, and raised $1.4 million in the final week of the period, including 50,000 new donations."I won't sugarcoat it," Roger Lau, Warren's campaign manager, wrote in an email to supporters."We were outraised by some other candidates in the presidential primary this first quarter.""Because Elizabeth's been able to count on grassroots donations, she's been able to spend her time visiting as many states as possible, meeting voters, and calling grassroots donors to personally thank them for giving," Lau wrote.Read: Here's what the 2020 Democratic candidates say they've raised in the first quarter In comparison to Warren, both Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent, and former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke said they raised about $6 million in the first day of their campaigns.Sanders' average donation for the first quarter was $20, while O'Rourke's was $43.Official tallies from all the campaigns are due Monday.The New York Times reported last month that Warren's finance director, Michael Pratt, left the campaign after pleading unsuccessfully in February with the candidate to pursue wealthy donors and not to rule out high-priced fundraisers.But Warren disagreed.Warren announced later in February that she would not host any events that were limited to those who could write "big checks."Warren also released her 2018 tax returns on Wednesday.Those showed a family income of slightly more than $900,000.Other candidates said they raised the following amount in the first quarter: Sanders raised $18.2 million Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., raised $12 million O'Rourke raised $9.4 million South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg raised $7 million Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., raised $5.2 million Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., raised $5 million Andrew Yang, a businessman, raised $1.7 million -- CNBC's Kevin Breuninger contributed to this report
Bernie Sanders unveils Medicare for All bill amid 2020 Democratic primary:::::Sen. Bernie Sanders unveiled a universal health-care plan on Wednesday as he tries to set the tone on a pivotal issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.The Vermont independent introduced a new "Medicare for All" bill that would create a government-run system to provide health insurance for all Americans.While Sanders has proposed legislation to create a single-payer system before, the measure unveiled Wednesday would go further in covering long-term care for people with disabilities, bringing it in line with a bill introduced in the House earlier this year.Sanders, who helped to vault Medicare for All into the political mainstream, hopes embracing sweeping change will help separate him from a crowded primary field.While four of Sanders' Democratic rivals Sens.Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts co-sponsored his legislation, none have as fully embraced the dismantling of the private insurance system as Sanders has."The current debate over Medicare for All really has nothing to do with health care," the senator said at a news conference unveiling the legislation."It has everything to do with greed and profiteering.It is about whether we continue a dysfunctional system."Sanders' bill, which has 14 Senate co-sponsors, would: Cover primary and preventive care, prescription drugs, dental and vision care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, as well as maternity, newborn and long-term care through a government-run plan Let Americans see any doctor they want to with no deductibles or copays Effectively end the private health insurance market On Wednesday, Sanders' office outlined potential methods to finance the system.Those include income-based premiums paid by employees and employers, hiking the marginal tax rate to up to 70 percent on people making $10 million or more, raising the estate tax and putting a "fee on large financial institutions."Sanders has argued a single-payer system would reduce costs for consumers.While the government would have to hike taxes to cover a potential price tag in the tens of trillions of dollars, the senator says Americans would see fewer out-of-pocket costs.His office pointed in part to studies that it says show U.S. overall health spending would drop under a Medicare for All plan though government health-care outlays would spike dramatically.
AG Barr says Justice Department will look at origins of Russia probe:::::Mueller report: Why Trump's legal woes appear far from over 4:37 PM ET Thu, 4 April 2019 | 03:25 Many Republicans on Capitol Hill, especially those closely allied with Trump, have called for an investigation into the beginnings of the government's Russia probes throughout Mueller's 22-month probe into Kremlin interference in the 2016 election, potential Russian collusion with Trump's campaign and possible obstruction of justice by Trump.Their calls have grown louder in the wake of Barr's summary of the principal conclusions from Mueller's yet-to-be-released report, in which Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that the special counsel did not find sufficient evidence to merit an obstruction charge.Bar told a House subcommittee Tuesday that he expected that a version of the Mueller report with redactions would be out "within a week."On Wednesday, however, Barr told the Senate panel that "the report's gonna be out next week."Barr acknowledged that much investigation on this topic has already taken place, and that the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General is still investigating the matter.He explained that his probe would take a holistic look at the investigations, both from government agencies and congressional committees."One of the things I want to do is pull together all the information from the various investigations that have gone on, including on the Hill and in the department, and see if there are any remaining questions to be addressed," Barr said.Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the subcommittee's ranking member, asked Barr to explain why he was taking this action."I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal.It's a big deal," he said, adding that the Vietnam War generation in which he grew up was very concerned about spying on antiwar Americans by the government.Shaheen asked Barr to clarify that "you're not suggesting, though, that spying occurred" within the Trump campaign.Barr responded: "I think spying did occur."The most important question, he added, is "whether it was ... adequately predicated.I'm not saying it wasn't adequately predicated, but I need to explore that."Trump, speaking to reporters Wednesday morning before Barr's testimony began, blasted Mueller's probe, referring to it as an "attempted takedown of a president.""What they did was treason," Trump added.Barr swapped out the term "spying" for "unauthorized surveillance" when Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, asked the attorney general if he wanted to use more precise language."I think the word 'spying' could cause everybody in the cable news ecosystem to freak out," Schatz said.Other Democratic lawmakers offered more direct criticism of Barr's testimony."The top law enforcement officer of the country should not casually suggest that those under his purview engaged in 'spying' on a political campaign," House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said in a statement."This type of partisan talking point may please Donald Trump, who rails against a 'deep state coup,' but it also strikes another destructive blow to our democratic institutions," Schiff added."The hardworking men and women at the DOJ and FBI deserve better."Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., called Barr's language "irresponsible" in a tweet.At the tail end of the hearing, Barr clarified: "I am not saying that improper surveillance occurred.I'm saying that I am concerned about it and looking into it.That's all."
Elizabeth Warren releases 2018 tax returns showing $900,000 income:::::Presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., released her 2018 tax returns on Wednesday, revealing an income of nearly $1 million last year between her and her husband, Bruce.Warren, a consumer advocate who has made combating corruption one of her signature policy priorities, used the release of her returns to champion a sweeping anti-corruption bill she introduced in the Senate that requires the IRS to release eight years of returns filed by candidates for president and vice president."I've put out eleven years of my tax returns because no one should ever have to guess who their elected officials are working for," Warren said."Doing this should be law."Warren and her husband, a professor at Harvard, paid more than $200,000 in taxes on about $900,000 in income last year, the returns show.Here's what else the returns showed: Warren made about $325,000 from book sales in addition to her $175,000 salary from the Senate.Bruce was paid about $400,000 from Harvard.The couple paid about $46,000 last year for a solar energy installation on their home in Massachusetts, and received about $15,000 in tax credits.The couple donated more than $50,000 to charity.Read more: Trump says 'people don't care' about his tax returns, but polls show otherwise Her disclosure comes as President Donald Trump fights congressional efforts brought by House Democrats to force the release of his returns.Trump has gone back and forth on whether he will release his returns, though his acting chief of staff recently said they will never be made public.Trump has said that their release would impact an ongoing audit, though the IRS has said that audits do not prevent individuals from releasing their tax information.The move also put more pressure on rivals who have not yet released their own, as other top Democratic 2020 contenders are still holding out.Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, has said that his returns will be public by April 15.Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg are among other top contenders who have yet to make their latest returns public, although those returns are not due to the government until Monday.Sen.

Trump says 'people don't care' about his tax returns, but polls show otherwise:::::President Donald Trump thinks Americans don't care about seeing his tax returns.But most voters want the president to release his tax information or support Democratic efforts to get the documents if Trump refuses to share them, according to polls.Speaking to reporters Wednesday before traveling to Texas, Trump claimed he would "love" to release his tax returns but will not do so "while [he is] under audit."The president is locked in a legal battle with House Democrats, who asked for six years of tax returns last week as they seek information about Trump's financial holdings and potential conflicts of interest.The president refused to release his tax returns during his 2016 campaign, breaking with decades of precedent."Remember, I got elected last time," Trump told reporters on the White House lawn."The same exact issue, with the same intensity, which wasn't very much.Because frankly, the people don't care."Voters care more than Trump would like to admit.A majority, or 51%, of registered voters support Democrats' efforts to obtain the president's tax returns, versus 36% who oppose the push, according to a Morning Consult/Politico poll released Wednesday.Among independent voters, 46% back the Democratic lawmakers' effort, while 34% do not.The Morning Consult/Politico poll of 1,992 registered voters has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.
Trump congratulates Netanyahu on his apparent reelection:::::President Donald Trump on Wednesday congratulated incumbent Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on his apparent win in the country's elections."I'd like to congratulate Bibi Netanyahu, it looks like that race has been won by him," Trump told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House."It may be a little early, but it looks like he's won it in good fashion.""He's been a great ally and he's a friend," Trump said."That was a well thought out race."Trump later called Netanyahu on the phone to congratulate him, the prime minister's office said in a statement.As of Wednesday morning, vote counts appeared to give Netanyahu a historic fifth term in office.His Likud party was deadlocked with the new Blue and White party led by former military chief Benny Gantz with 35 seats each in the 120-member parliament.But Likud and its traditional political allies were in command of a 65-55 majority, according to The Associated Press.Israel's president, Reuven Rivlin, will consult with party representatives next week before picking the candidate with the best chance of assembling a parliamentary majority, according to AP.Trump said a government led by Netanyahu would improve the odds of reaching a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians."The fact that Bibi won, I think we'll see some pretty good action in terms of peace.Everybody said, and I never made it a promise, 'you can't have peace in the Middle East with Israel and the Palestinians.'But I think we have a chance, and I think now we have a better chance with Bibi having won," Trump said.Trump is one of the staunchest allies Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition have had, even surpassing the traditionally close alliance that Israeli leaders and American presidents have maintained for 70 years.Early on in his first term, Trump named his son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner, to lead an effort to come up with a Middle East peace plan.Now, two years later, the White House has yet to unveil any firm proposals on the subject.Asked on Wednesday about the status of the efforts, National Security Adviser John Bolton said, "We've been in the preparatory stages to getting it ready.And I think we're going to see that coming out in the very near future."In the absence of a road map for peace, however, the Trump administration has instituted several U.S. policies in the Middle East that experts interpret as having helped boost Netanyahu's domestic political fortunes.Among them: Trump's 2017 decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, breaking decades of official U.S. policy.At the time, Trump called the move "a long-overdue step to advance the peace process and to work towards a lasting agreement."But few experts in the region believed the embassy move would, in fact, advance the peace process."It's not just that it's provoked violence or that it's made the United States look like the biased broker instead of the honest broker," former U.S.Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk said of the embassy move in 2018."It also has set the process back in a way that all this loose talk about how it's going to advance peace is ludicrous."In the run-up to the election, Trump last month recognized Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria during Six-Day War in 1967 and subsequently annexed.On the eve of the election, the Trump administration announced Monday that it would designate an entire branch of the Iranian military as a terrorist organization.The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has about 125,000 active duty troops in Iran, and its members are engaged in nearly all aspects of Iranian society.Like the embassy move before it, the decision to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization was unilateral and was not done in concert with U.S. allies in Europe or Asia.It remained unclear Tuesday exactly how the designation would affect individuals and businesses operating outside the United States.During a call with reporters Monday, a senior administration official dodged the issue of whether the United States had a plan to win European support for the designation.The official also declined to say whether the announcement was deliberately timed to give Netanyahu a boost in the polls.Over in Israel, the prime minister took credit for the IRGC announcement, thanking Trump in Hebrew on Twitter for "responding to another of my important requests, which serves the interests of our countries and countries of the region."Netanyahu's English-language version of the tweet also thanked Trump, however, it made no mention of any request that Trump had acted upon.
Senate Democrats propose bigger tax credits for children, poor families:::::Senate Democrats unveiled a proposal Wednesday to significantly expand tax credits for children and low-income households and provide fresh ammunition for attacking President Donald Trump's tax cuts.The effort is led by Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who had toyed with launching a 2020 presidential campaign but decided to focus on working-class issues as a lawmaker.The new bill would roughly quadruple the earned income tax credit for childless workers, increase the credit for households with children and create a new benefit for children under age 6.The proposal has the backing of Dick Durbin of Illinois, the second-ranked Democrat in the Senate; Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee; and Michael Bennet of Colorado, who is planning to run for president.Under the plan, known as the Working Families Tax Relief: The tax credit for low-income households without children would jump from a maximum of $530 to $2,070.It would also expand the eligible ages to 19 to 67 from the current 25 to 64.That credit would rise by roughly 25% for families with children.Households could receive a one-time, interest-free advance on those credits worth up to $500.Families with young children could also claim a new tax credit of up to $3,000.The senators argue that the plan would have broad ramifications, especially for poor families.They estimate it would lift 7 million people out of poverty, including 3 million children, and increase incomes for 46 million households."As Americans are filing their taxes, more and more people are seeing the Trump tax scam for what it was a handout to millionaires and billionaires at the expense of working people and families," the lawmakers said in a statement.The plan does not include corresponding tax increases on the wealthy or for raising the corporate tax rate measures that have gained traction among progressives and have been embraced by several Democratic presidential candidates.The senators also did not provide an estimate of how much the proposal would cost.Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage in the Senate, making it unlikely that Democrats will pass the measure any time soon.The bill has 44 co-sponsors in the Democratic caucus.The three holdouts are Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Dianne Feinstein of California and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona.Still, the bill gives Democrats a fresh political tool to hammer the GOP and Trump with the 2020 elections on the horizon.The measure is intended to be a counterpoint to the sweeping overhaul of the tax code that Trump signed at the end of 2017.Democrats have criticized the law as primarily benefiting corporations and the wealthy and appear to be winning the messaging battle.According to the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, only 17% of voters believe they will receive a tax cut as a result of those changes.More than a quarter said their taxes would go up.Democrats have pressed their advantage with a slew of proposals targeted at reducing taxes for working families and expanding the social safety net.Brown has long pushed to expand the low-income tax credit and give workers early access to their refunds, but this latest bill goes further.It also echoes a proposal from Sen. Kamala Harris of California, a Democratic presidential hopeful.Her bill, the Lift Act, would provide a refundable tax credit worth up to $6,000 for households with or without children and allow them to receive payments in an annual lump sum or monthly installments.An aide to Brown said the price tag and how to to pay for it would be part of the debate over the bill.Democrats also intend to highlight that the Republicans' tax cuts will cost $1.5 trillion over a decade and has contributed to higher deficits over the past year.
Brexit summit: EU expected to grant UK extension with strings attached:::::European leaders will decide on Wednesday whether to grant the U.K. another extension to its departure from the bloc, due to take place on Friday April 12.The EU's 28 leaders, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, are heading to Brussels for an emergency summit dedicated to Brexit.This after May asked the bloc for a second delay to the U.K.'s departure.The summit begins at 17:00 London time and May will formally present her case for requesting a short delay to Brexit until June 30, asking for the option to leave if a deal is agreed by the U.K. Parliament before then.It's widely expected that the U.K. will be granted a longer, flexible extension with conditions attached, however, according to an invitation letter sent to EU leaders by European Council President Donald Tusk on Tuesday."I believe we should also discuss an alternative, longer extension.One possibility would be a flexible extension, which would last only as long as necessary and no longer than one year," Tusk said in his letter.He called for a longer delay to avoid "the risk of a rolling series of short extensions and emergency summits, creating new cliff-edge dates."Conditions that the U.K. could have to abide by, Tusk noted, would include no re-opening of negotiations over the withdrawal agreement (the Brexit deal) on offer.The U.K. could leave earlier than a newly agreed departure date if a deal is in place and Tusk reiterated that the U.K. could revoke Article 50 (the departure process) at any time.A draft EU document circulated to diplomats ahead of the emergency meeting of EU leaders proposes an extension but leaves the date blank.It also notes that an extension cannot be used to undermine the EU or to start trade talks.
Texas Tech med school agrees to no longer consider race in admissions:::::1 in 4 Americans do not have access to basic banking services.Here's what activists are doing to fix it 5:40 PM ET Wed, 13 Feb 2019 | 03:28 The move appears to be the first time the Trump administration has secured a commitment from a school to no longer consider race in admissions.The agreement requires that the school revise all of its admissions and recruitment materials by September.The pact's existence was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.The Trump administration has been hostile to affirmative action policies, which were encouraged under President Barack Obama.In July, the Departments of Justice and Education announced that they had scrapped Obama-era policy guidelines that called on schools to factor in the race of their applicants in order to achieve diversity."The Supreme Court has issued clear guidance on the appropriate consideration of race in college admissions," Liz Hill, press secretary for the Education Department, said in a statement.The Supreme Court has long upheld affirmative action under certain conditions and did so again recently in a 2016 case involving the University of Texas.A representative for the medical school did not immediately provide comment.
Israel's election results: Benjamin Netanyahu versus Benny Gantz:::::Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu secured a clear path to reelection on Wednesday, with religious-rightist parties set to hand him a parliamentary majority despite a close contest against his main centrist challenger, a vote tally showed.With more than 97 percent of votes counted, Netanyahu's conservative Likud party looked likely to muster enough support to control 65 of the Knesset's 120 seats and be named to head the next coalition government - a record fifth term as premier.The close and often vitriolic contest was widely seen in Israel as a referendum on Netanyahu's character and record in the face of corruption allegations.He faces possible indictment in three graft cases, and has denied wrongdoing in all of them.Despite that, Netanyahu gained four seats compared to his outgoing coalition government, according to a spreadsheet published by the Central Elections Committee of parties that won enough votes to enter the next parliament."It is a night of colossal victory," the 69-year-old Netanyahu told cheering supporters in a late-night speech at Likud headquarters after Tuesday's vote."He's a magician," the crowd chanted as fireworks flared and Netanyahu kissed his wife Sara.
White House proposed releasing immigrant detainees in sanctuary cities, targeting political foes:::::President Trump on Dec. 7, 2018, criticized local officials who have refused to work with federal immigration authorities.(The Washington Post) White House officials have tried to pressure U.S. immigration authorities to release detainees onto the streets of sanctuary cities to retaliate against President Trumps political adversaries, according to Department of Homeland Security officials and email messages reviewed by The Washington Post.Trump administration officials have proposed transporting detained immigrants to sanctuary cities at least twice in the past six months once in November, as a migrant caravan approached the U.S. southern border, and again in February, amid a standoff with Democrats over funding for Trumps border wall.House Speaker Nancy Pelosis district in San Francisco was among those the White House wanted to target, according to DHS officials.The administration also considered releasing detainees in other Democratic strongholds.White House officials first broached the plan in a Nov. 16 email, asking officials at several agencies whether members of the caravan could be arrested at the border and then bused to small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities, places where local authorities have refused to hand over illegal immigrants for deportation.[Trump administration considers revised version of family separation tactic] The White House told U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that the plan was intended to alleviate a shortage of detention space but also served to send a message to Democrats.The attempt at political retribution raised alarm within ICE, with a top official responding that it was rife with budgetary and liability concerns, and noting that there are PR risks as well.After the White House pressed again in February, ICEs legal department rejected the idea as inappropriate and rebuffed the administration.A White House official and a spokesman for DHS sent nearly identical statements to The Post on Thursday, indicating that the proposal is no longer under consideration.This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion, the White House statement said.Protesters hold up signs outside a courthouse in San Francisco in April 2017, arguing against tough immigration enforcement efforts.(Haven Daley/AP) Pelosis office blasted the plan.The extent of this administrations cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated, said Pelosi spokeswoman Ashley Etienne.Using human beings including little children as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.President Trump has made immigration a central aspect of his administration, and he has grown increasingly frustrated at the influx of migrants from Central America.He often casts them as killers and criminals who threaten U.S. security, pointing to cases in which immigrants have killed U.S. citizens including a notable case on a San Francisco pier in 2015.And he has railed against liberal sanctuary-city policies, saying they endanger Americans.These outrageous sanctuary cities are grave threats to public safety and national security, Trump said in a speech to the Safe Neighborhoods Conference in Kansas City, Mo., on Dec. 7, less than a month after the White House asked ICE about moving detainees to such cities.Each year, sanctuary cities release thousands of known criminal aliens from their custody and right back into the community.So they put them in, and they have them, and they let them go, and it drives you people a little bit crazy, doesnt it, huh?Anti-sanctuary law protesters rally outside of the Los Alamitos City Hall, before a vote on whether to comply with the sanctuary state law in Los Alamitos, Calif., in April 2018.(Philip Cheung for The Washington Post) The White House believed it could punish Democrats including Pelosi by busing ICE detainees into their districts before their release, according to two DHS whistleblowers who independently reported the busing plan to Congress.One of the whistleblowers spoke with The Washington Post, and several DHS officials confirmed the accounts.They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.Senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller discussed the proposal with ICE, according to two DHS officials.Matthew Albence, who is ICEs acting deputy director, immediately questioned the proposal in November.Albence declined to comment but issued a statement through a spokesman acknowledging there was a discussion about the proposal.As the Acting Deputy I was not pressured by anyone at the White House on this issue.I was asked my opinion and provided it and my advice was heeded, the statement said.DHS officials said the proposal resurfaced during the shutdown talks three months later, when Albence brought ICE attorneys into the discussion, seeking the legal review that ultimately doomed the proposal.Miller declined to comment.His name did not appear on any of the documents reviewed by The Post.But as he is White House senior adviser on immigration policy, officials at ICE understood that he was pressing the plan.Presidential adviser Stephen Miller attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House on Aug. 16.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Trump has been demanding aggressive action to deal with the surge of migrants, and many of his administrations proposals have been blocked in federal court or, like the family separation policy last year, have backfired as public relations disasters.Homeland Security officials said the sanctuary city request was unnerving, and it underscores the political pressure Trump and Miller have put on ICE and other DHS agencies at a time when the president is furious about the biggest border surge in more than a decade.It was basically an idea that Miller wanted that nobody else wanted to carry out, said one congressional investigator who has spoken to one of the whistleblowers.What happened here is that Stephen Miller called people at ICE, said if theyre going to cut funding, youve got to make sure youre releasing people in Pelosis district and other congressional districts.The investigator spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect the whistleblower.The idea of releasing immigrants into sanctuary cities was not presented to Ronald Vitiello, the agencys acting director, according to one DHS official familiar with the plan.Last week, the White House rescinded Vitiellos nomination to lead ICE, giving no explanation, and Vitiello submitted his resignation Wednesday, ending his 30-year-career.President Trump said on March 8 that the Justice Department is doing a "fantastic job" to get rid of sanctuary city policies, and criticized the mayor of Oakland, Calif. (The Washington Post) The day after Vitiellos nomination was rescinded, President Trump told reporters he wanted to put someone tougher at ICE.DHS officials said they do not know whether ICEs refusal to adopt the White Houses plan contributed to Vitiellos removal.His departure puts Albence in charge of the agency as of Friday.The White House proposal reached ICE first in November as a highly publicized migrant caravan was approaching the United States.May Davis, deputy assistant to the president and deputy White House policy coordinator, wrote to officials with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the Department of Homeland Security with the subject line: Sanctuary City Proposal.The idea has been raised by 1-2 principals that, if we are unable to build sufficient temporary housing, that caravan members be bussed to small- and mid-sized sanctuary cities, Davis wrote, seeking responses to the ideas operational and legal viability.There is NOT a White House decision on this.Albence replied that such a plan would create an unnecessary operational burden on an already strained organization and raised concerns about its appropriateness, writing: Not sure how paying to transport aliens to another location to release them when they can be released on the spot is a justified expenditure.Not to mention the liability should there be an accident along the way.Matthew Albence, ICE acting deputy director, testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee in July 2018.(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) The White House pushed the issue a second time in the midst of the budget standoff in mid-February, according to DHS officials, and on the heels of a bitterly partisan 35-day government shutdown over Trumps border wall plan.The White House discussed the immigrant release idea as a way to punish Democrats standing in the way of funding additional detention beds.ICE detainees with violent criminal records are not typically released on bond or other alternatives to detention while they await a hearing with an immigration judge, but there have been instances of such detainees being released.The White House urged ICE to channel releases to sanctuary districts, regardless of whether immigrants had any ties to those places.It was retaliation, to show them, Your lack of cooperation has impacts, said one of the DHS officials, summarizing the rationale.I think they thought it would put pressure on those communities to understand, I guess, a different perspective on why you need more immigration money for detention beds.Senior officials at ICE did not take the proposal seriously at first, but as the White House exerted pressure, ICEs legal advisers were asked to weigh in, DHS officials said.A formal legal review was never completed, according to two DHS officials familiar with the events, but senior ICE attorneys told Albence and others that the plan was inappropriate and lacked a legal basis.If we would have done that, we would have had to expend transportation resources, and make a decision that were going to use buses, planes, etc., to send these aliens to a place for whatever reason, a senior DHS official said.We had to come up with a reason, and we did not have one.The proposal faded when House Democrats ultimately relented on their demand for a decrease in the number of detention beds, a final sticking point in budget talks between the White House and House Democrats.An immigration detainee stands near a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement grievance box in the high-security unit at the Theo Lacy Facility, a county jail that also houses immigration detainees in Orange, Calif. (Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images) The number of immigrant detainees in ICE custody has approached 50,000 in recent months, an all-time high that has further strained the agencys budget.Those include immigrants arrested in the U.S. interior, as well as recent border-crossers transferred from U.S. Border Patrol.With unauthorized migration at a 12-year high, the vast majority of recent migrants and especially those with children are quickly processed and released with a notice to appear in court, a system that Trump has derided as catch and release.The process has left Trump seething, convinced that immigration officials and DHS more broadly should adopt a harsher approach.Vitiellos removal from ICE last week was followed Sunday by the ouster of DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who lost favor with Trump and Miller by repeatedly warning the White House that the administrations policy ideas were unworkable and likely to be blocked by federal courts.The sanctuary city proposal ran contrary to ICE policy guidelines, as well as legal counsel.ICE officials balked at the notion of moving migrants to detention facilities in different areas, insisting that Congress only authorizes the agency to deport immigrants, not relocate them internally, according to DHS officials.The plan to retaliate against sanctuary cities came just after Trump agreed to reopen the government in late January, following a five-week shutdown over wall funding.The president gave lawmakers three weeks to come up with a plan to secure the border before a second fiscal deadline in mid-February.During the talks, Republicans and Democrats sparred over the number of detention beds, with House Democrats pressing for a lower number amid pressure from their left flank.It was during that mid-February standoff that one whistleblower went to Congress alleging that the White House was considering a plan to punish Democrats if they did not relent on ICE funding for beds.A second official independently came forward after that.According to both, there were at least two versions of the plan being considered.One was to move migrants who were already in ICE detention to the districts of Democratic opponents.The second option was to bus migrants apprehended at the border to sanctuary cities, such as New York, Chicago and San Francisco.An Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer monitors a demonstration outside of the San Francisco ICE office on June 19, 2018.(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Josh Dawsey contributed to this report.
Pence says he considered Buttigieg ‘a friend’ who now is making ‘attacks on my Christian faith’:::::The week-long back and forth between Vice President Pence and 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg over their past working relationship in Indiana and their differing views of religion in politics continued into Friday.In separate interviews, Pence said as governor of Indiana he worked closely with Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., and considered him a friend.Buttigieg said hes not interested in feuding with Pence and is just pointing out the vice presidents discriminatory policies against the LGBTQ community.Buttigieg, who has seen a meteoric rise in popularity, has mentioned Pence several times in speeches that have received a lot of attention.He accused Pence of abandoning his morals by supporting a porn star presidency and that he wished Pence and others on the religious right understood that their quarrel over his being gay is with my creator.[He knows better: Pete Buttigieg has made Mike Pence his target, and the vice president isnt pleased] Pence, speaking to CNN Thursday, demurred when asked whether he agreed with Buttigieg that God made him gay.All of us have our own religious convictions.Pete has his convictions, I have mine, Pence said.I hope that Pete will offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith or attacks on the president as he seeks the highest office in the land.Pence, asked again about Buttigiegs comments and whether he considers being gay a sin, said, Im a Bible-believing Christian.I draw my truth from Gods word.Meanwhile, Buttigieg, in an interview Thursday with Ellen DeGeneres on her talk show, which will air Friday afternoon, said hes not critical of Pences religion but rather how he uses his religion as a justification to harm people and especially in the LGBTQ community.If he wanted to clear this up, he could come out today and say hes changed his mind, that it shouldnt be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are, Buttigieg said.As governor, Pence backed legislation in 2015 that allowed businesses to refuse customers for religious reasons.Shortly thereafter, a pizza restaurant in the state said it would use the law as justification to never cater a gay wedding.Buttigieg, who will officially announce his candidacy for president in South Bend on Sunday, is polling at 9 percent in Iowa, according to a recent Monmouth University poll.That puts him behind former vice president Joe Biden, who has 27 percent of Iowa Democrats support, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has 16 percent, but ahead of everyone else in the crowded field.Similarly, a poll by the New Hampshire Institute of Politics found that in that state, Biden had 23 percent, Sanders 16 percent and Buttigieg 11 percent.Buttigieg often speaks of his faith in speeches, but distinguishes his Christianity from the religious right by pointing out that it is his faith that guides his progressive policy beliefs.That doesnt have to be anybody elses understanding of religion, but its where Christianity takes me, Buttigieg told DeGeneres.And that does have implications for how I behave in the political space.
The Technology 202: Disinformation spread by Americans is 'the hardest challenge that we have,' DHS official says:::::Ctrl + N The Homeland Security Department headquarters is seen in northwest Washington.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File) SAUSALITO, CALIF.The government's biggest challenge isn't combating disinformation spread by Russia or other foreign actors ahead of the 2020 elections.It's the fake news and information generated and spread by Americans.That's the view from a senior cybersecurity adviser at the Department of Homeland Security, who says domestic disinformation is the hardest challenge that we have.Amplification of domestic activity is something thats very hard, if not impossible, for the federal government to respond to, given all of the appropriate First Amendment protections that lie around it, Matt Masterson said at a conference hosted by the Hewlett Foundation.The dilemma is especially top of mind after the 2018 midterms, when law enforcement, tech companies and researchers saw that Americans were taking a page out of Russias playbook and spreading lies and stoking divisions on social media.The government wields broader authorities when foreign adversaries are trying to sow discord on social media it investigated and indicted a Russian group of Internet trolls for information warfare, and even launched an offensive cyberoperation to take down the St. Petersburg troll farm during the midterm elections.But when Americans are manufacturing the falsehoods, the government has to tread more cautiously.It has to be mindful about how it even flags it to the tech industry.The government has to be very careful as it responds to disinformation that Americans share, former FBI chief James B. Comey said at the same conference.By contrast, Comey said, if youre focused on a troll farm in St. Petersburg, there are authorities that can be used there where youre not worried about infringing on free speech.At home, the FBI can share communications that seem suspicious in a responsible way with the technology companies, who he called a ready partner to ensure widely-used platforms do not foster disinformation or other harmful content.But even when sharing information you have to do in a thoughtful way, Comey said.Because if youre wrong or you overshare, you might step on speech you shouldnt be going anywhere near.DHS also has shared information with the technology companies, Masterson said.When we would get information from state and local officials, we push it to the platforms with no comment on anything other than this was given to us and then allow them to take the appropriate action, Masterson said.That puts the onus on Silicon Valley companies to determine how to crack down on fake news, at a time when theyre already wrestling with pressure to improve their content moderation efforts.Though the tech giants say they are committed to keeping their platforms safe and preserving democratic institutions, they also are struggling to make tough calls that could impact speech online.Facebook recently called for regulations that would set a baseline for what content should be prohibited.Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power over speech, and frankly I agree, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a recent op-ed.Ive come to believe that we shouldnt make so many important decisions about speech on our own.Despite its limitations, the U.S. government is also trying to get creative as it tries to prevent a repeat of the 2016 presidential election.Masterson tells me DHS is expanding its efforts to educate the American public on ways to spot the tactics and techniques of disinformation, whether it's domestic or foreign in origin.From a federal government perspective, as we look at disinformation and responding, our approach at DHS is going to be to push out and educate the American public about what disinformation tactics look like, he said.DHS already engaged in education and awareness efforts ahead of the 2018 midterms.The agency worked with state and local election officials to ensure that voters knew where they could obtain trusted information about their polling places or whether theyre registered to vote.But ahead of 2020, the agency is hoping to work with a broader set of partners to help Americans be vigilant for fake news online.Already, DHS is working with the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School on this issue.Masterson told me the efforts are still in early stages, but he would like to do outreach with local libraries and groups representing Americans who are disproportionately targeted with disinformation, like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People or AARP.You are reading The Technology 202, our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.Not a regular subscriber?BITS, NIBBLES AND BYTES Uber is providing a

ride-hailing service since its inception a decade ago.(AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) BITS: Uber filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public -- a watershed moment for the company that has been trying to dominate the global ride-sharing business, my colleague Faiz Siddiqui reports.The company, which operates in 63 countries, is significantly larger than its rival Lyft, operates only domestically the United States.It also has a broader range of additional businesses, including a food delivery service called Uber Eats and a freight unit."Uber has struggled to stem billions of dollars in losses and has been forced to exit some markets, caving to competition from local rivals," Faiz wrote."In documents released Thursday, Uber said its revenue last year rose 42 percent to reach $11.3 billion, with $1 billion in profit, derived from selling some of its overseas businesses.Its operating losses last year totaled $1.8 billion."Doubts are growing about the ride-hailing business model as Uber takes this critical step toward its public offering.Lyfts shares have declined sharply since opening at $72 last month, closing at just over $61 Wednesday."In contrast to Lyft, which highlighted self-driving cars as its direct path to profitability -- through the elimination of drivers -- Uber cited the 'long hybrid period of co-existence of Drivers and autonomous vehicles'

Mueller III, in a case filed last year against 13 Russians accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential campaign, said workers at a St. Petersburg facility called the Internet Research Agency were instructed to write social media posts in opposition to Clinton but 'to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.'At the request of the Washington Post, a pair of Clemson University researchers conducted an analysis of Twitter data that revealed the broad scope of the Russian campaign.They studied English-language tweets, coming from Russia, which were designed to influence the election."It is impossible to say how many were targeted at Sanders supporters because many dont include his name," Michael writes."Some 9,000 of the Russian tweets used the word 'Bernie,' which were liked 59,281 times and retweeted 61,804 times."The researchers also found there were many other tweets, with no direct reference to Sanders, that aimed to prevent his supporters from turning out for Hillary Clinton on Election Day.I think there is no question that Sanders was central to their strategy.He was clearly used as a mechanism to decrease voter turnout for Hillary Clinton, one of the Clemson researchers, Darren Linvill, associate professor of communications, told Michael.The tweets studied they analyzed give us a much clearer understanding of the tactics they were using.It was certainly a higher volume than people thought.Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO, speaks at The Economic Club in Washington.(AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File) BYTES: Amazon chief executive and Washington Post owner Jeffrey P.

Trump’s approval is back at the upper end of a very narrow window:::::President Trump gives a thumbs-up during and event in Las Vegas earlier this month.(Eilon Paz/Bloomberg) If your only source of information about President Trumps approval rating is President Trumps Twitter feed, youre likely under the impression that its skyrocketing.After all, on March 28 he tweeted an image showing his approval at 50 percent in Rasmussen Reports (consistently Trump-friendly) polling.On Tuesday, Rasmussen had Trump at 53 percent.And then, on Thursday, a stunning 55 percent in a poll reported by Fox Businesss Lou Dobbs.Unfortunately for supporters whose information about Trumps popularity comes from his tweets, that last number was actually Trumps unfavorable rating in the cited poll.His approval was a more modest 43 percent.But even 43 percent isnt bad for Trump.On Friday morning, Gallup reported that Trumps approval had jumped to 45 percent in its polling, only the third time its been that high.The other two moments were at his inauguration and in mid-June 2018, at about the time of his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.(Philip Bump/The Washington Post) Its worth noting, though, how little Trumps approval rating has actually ranged since hes been in office.That 45 percent approval is one of three times its been that high, at the upper end of a range that only extends over 11 percentage points.Four times in Gallups polling hes been at 35 percent, the opposite end of the spectrum.Just up and down, from 35 to 45.(Philip Bump/The Washington Post) The reason for this isnt a secret: Trumps consistent support from Republicans and consistent opposition from Democrats has largely anchored the poles of his support.Independents move around a little, making up much of the change.The jump to 45 percent in the recent poll, for example, is in part a function of his gaining six percentage points in his approval from independents.But, in the exception that proves the rule (or something), its also in part a function of his doing better with Democrats.The narrowness of the range of Trumps approval ratings stands out when compared to past presidents with one exception.(Philip Bump/The Washington Post) George W. Bushs approval, for example, ranged over 70 points, a function of his post-9/11 popularity and ensuing post-Iraq unpopularity.Barack Obamas approval, like Bill Clintons, ranged over 28 points but only because he had a brief honeymoon period at the beginning of his presidency.After that, Republican opposition to Obama hardened, and he, too, saw approval ratings that stayed only within a narrow range.Its not solely a function of Trumps not having yet served a full term.John Kennedy, who served about seven months more than Trump has to this point, saw his approval rating range over 28 points.In a world where partisanship was more fluid, approval ratings could move more.Thats why Trumps insistences that hes at 50 percent approval or higher a level of support hes never seen in most non-Rasmussen polls should inspire skepticism.Unless hes winning over a lot of Democrats (seemingly unlikely) or a ton of independents, hes not going to see a big boost in his approval numbers.Weve scaled our expectations down to the point that his, again, reaching 45 percent seems ...not bad.Hes tied with his highest approval rating on record!Its just that 45 percent is lower than the average approval rating in Gallups polling of every other president since Franklin Roosevelt.At the upper end of Trumps approval, in other words, it still isnt very good.And its not clear how it might go much higher.
Rod Rosenstein stuck his neck out for Trump. Now he’s doing it again for William Barr.:::::Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein is a short-timer at the Justice Department.And in one of his final acts along with seeing the Mueller report through to its conclusion hes vouching for a superior on controversial decisions in the Russia investigation.What could go wrong?Rosenstein on Thursday granted a rare interview to the Wall Street Journal, the purpose of which was clearly to express confidence in embattled Attorney General William P. Barr, who has been criticized for his letter summarizing key parts of the Mueller report and more recently for saying at a Senate hearing Wednesday that the FBI spied on the Trump campaign in 2016.Special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs team has suggested Barrs letter was misleading and left out key information, while spying is a talking point that is favored by President Trump but decidedly not by Barrs law enforcement colleagues.The narrative is building that Barr might be in the tank for Trump.Rosenstein professed to be dumbfounded by that narrative.Hes being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that hes trying to mislead people I think is just completely bizarre, Rosenstein said.He added: It would be one thing if you put out a letter and said, Im not going to give you the report.'What he said is, Look, its going to take a while to process the report.In the meantime, people really want to know whats in it.Im going to give you the top-line conclusions.Thats all he was trying to do.Rosensteins comments are notable because hes one of the few figures involved in the Russia investigation with some bipartisan credibility.He is a Trump appointee as the Justice Departments No.2, but he also has drawn Trumps ire as the overseer of the Mueller probe, which Trump has long argued is a hoax and a witch hunt.Rosenstein, in his few public comments, has taken on critics of the investigation and generally given Mueller broad berth.To some degree, Rosenstein was already invested in Barrs stewardship of the closing stages of the Mueller probe.He praised Barrs nomination, despite Barrs known history of criticizing the Mueller probe, and in that letter he joined with Barr in their controversial decision to exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice even as Mueller declined to either charge or exonerate him.But those things might have been expected of Rosenstein, given his role in the Justice Department and the Mueller probe.Granting the interview, on the other hand, is an especially strong statement that he didnt necessarily have to make at such a crucial juncture.And Rosenstein hasnt always had the best luck with such decisions.At the other bookend of the special counsels investigation was Rosensteins decision to author a letter criticizing then-FBI Director James B. Comey that Trump used to justify his firing.Shortly after this, Trump admitted he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosensteins thoughts and that he did so with the Russia probe on his mind.Reporting indicates Rosenstein felt used by Trump and that the episode had damaged his reputation.Via the New York Times: In public, Mr. Rosenstein has shown no hint that he had second thoughts about his role writing a memo about Mr. Comeys performance that the White House used to justify firing him.I wrote it.I believe it.I stand by it, Mr. Rosenstein said to Congress last year.But in meetings with law enforcement officials in the chaotic days immediately after Mr. Comeys dismissal, and in subsequent conversations with colleagues and friends, Mr. Rosenstein appeared conflicted, according to the four people.He alternately defended his involvement, expressed remorse at the tumult it unleashed, said the White House had manipulated him, fumed how the news media had portrayed the events and said the full story would vindicate him, said the people, who in recent weeks described the previously undisclosed episodes.In his Wall Street Journal interview, Rosenstein reiterated that he believed in the content of the memo and had few overall regrets about his time as a public official, as it nears an end.If you put something in writing, put your name on it and be prepared to stand behind it, he said.Thats been a theme of my career.Standing by your words, though, is only part of the equation.Vouching for the good faith of an individual who is embarking on a very fraught set of circumstances and whose actions are under fire is quite another.Rosenstein has now thrown in his lot with Barr, and hell find out whether that loyalty will be rewarded or wont ... again.
Chelsea Manning’s lawyer says the DOJ ‘bent over backwards’ to accommodate her medical needs:::::Former U.S. Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning speaks to reporters outside a U.S. federal courthouse.(Andrew Fischer/Reuters/Ford Fischer/News2Share) The Trump administration has often opposed transgender rights.In 2017 tweets, President Trump attacked transgender service members.Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory, he wrote, and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.Thank you.LGBTQ activists have said the tweets exemplify the Trump administrations much broader opposition to transgender rights.According to GLAAD, an LGBTQ rights organization, the Trump administration has attacked LGBTQ Americans in policy and rhetoric more than 100 times since 2017.Soon, his administration will take things a step further.On Friday, the U.S. armed forces will ban transgender people from serving, according to a Pentagon memo.The memo stipulates that a history of gender dysphoria would disqualify applicants to the military unless they have been stable in their biological sex for 36 months, are willing to abide by the rules for that sex, and have not transitioned and do not need to in the view of medical providers, my colleagues reported.That decision has been criticized on both sides of the aisle.It is indefensible that Trumps ban on Transgender troops is being implemented on Friday, conservative political analyst Meghan McCain tweeted.This discriminatory policy will lead Transgender service members, patriots who have decided to serve their nation, to live in the shadows.Its an unfair, un-American, and dangerous policy.Charlotte Clymer, an army veteran and LGBT activist, tweeted: "I carried caskets in Arlington Cemetery.I folded American flags for loved ones..I never knew their religion or education or birthplace...No one asked if those we buried were secretly trans.It didn't matter then, and it certainly doesnt matter now."-@cmclymer #TransMilitaryBan pic.twitter.com/Oni4YId12Y Human Rights Campaign (@HRC) April 10, 2019 Its unclear what will happen to transgender people currently serving in the armed forces.But lawyers for one of the most famous transgender veterans have offered some narrow praise for the administration on this issue.A lawyer for Chelsea Manning, a former army intelligence officer who came out as transgender in 2013, has praised the Justice Department for its treatment of her.In 2010, Manning leaked classified military and diplomatic documents to Julian Assange, who published them on WikiLeaks.Manning was convicted of conspiracy and served seven years of a 35-year prison term before President Barack Obama commuted her sentence.Manning was jailed again last month after she refused to testify before a grand jury investigating Assange.(British authorities arrested Assange on Thursday in response to a U.S. extradition request.A U.S. federal court unsealed an indictment in which he was charged with a single count of conspiracy to disclose classified information capable of being used to harm the United States.)Last month, Mannings attorney, Moira Meltzer-Cohen, told a judge it would be an act of tremendous cruelty to send the transgender ex-private to jail because of her medical and safety concerns.But she went on to praise prosecutors for working in good faith and stating that they bent over backwards to accommodate the medical needs connected to Mannings gender transition.The Justice Departments treatment of Manning doesnt change Trumps broader policy.But it does provide a real-life example of what the treatment of transgender veterans may look like in practice.
Why Trump’s non-answer on Julian Assange is so inexplicable:::::The Justice Department has revealed that it has charged Julian Assange, who is behind bars in Britain awaiting possible extradition to the United States.This has rendered unhelpful a whole lot of past commentary by President Trump.Trumps response: deflect, deflect, deflect.I know nothing about WikiLeaks, Trump told reporters Thursday.Its not my thing.I know nothing about WikiLeaks is patently false.While my thing is a subjective phrase open to interpretation, its pretty difficult to argue that WikiLeaks hasnt been Trumps thing.In fact, Trump mentioned WikiLeaks more than 100 times in just the final month of the 2016 campaign, according to Factba.se.Many of those times, he expressed admiration for the anti-secrecy groups work.This WikiLeaks stuff is unbelievable, he said once.Boy, I love reading those WikiLeaks, he said another time.Yet another time: Oh, we love WikiLeaks.Boy, they have really WikiLeaks!They have revealed a lot.[Trump disavows past enthusiasm for WikiLeaks after Assanges arrest] Trumps decision to play down his past embrace of WikiLeaks is no surprise.In fact, its his M.O.Whenever anyone around him gets in trouble be it Paul Manafort, George Papadopoulos or Michael Cohen he and his White House tend to minimize their proximity to him, no matter how implausibly.Foreign policy advisers become coffee boys.Campaign chairmen who ran the heart of his 2016 campaign become people who played a very limited role for a very limited amount of time.But Trump unquestionably made WikiLeaks a prominent feature of his stump speech in the closing days of the 2016 campaign, bear-hugging its disclosures and arguing it was performing an important service.The media trafficked in these disclosures, too, but Trump went a step further in actually praising WikiLeaks.As with Russia, he adopted an enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend approach.Even after he became president and his own intelligence community essentially accused WikiLeaks of being a front for the Russian government, Trump declined to harshly judge either one.Whats most jarring about all of this, though, is that he once actually suggested the death penalty for those involved with WikiLeaks.He did this just six years before 2016, after WikiLeaks and Chelsea Mannings Iraq and Afghanistan war disclosures.I think its disgraceful, Trump said at the time.I think it should be like death penalty or something.TRUMP in December 2010 on WikiLeaks: I think its disgraceful....I think it should be like death penalty or something.pic.twitter.com/1ogtD2Z7j8 JM Rieger (@RiegerReport) April 11, 2019 And, importantly, those are the events that are actually at the heart of the new charge against Assange not the 2016-Russia stuff.So even if Trump thinks the Russia stuff was okay and not a big deal, what about the leaks that he once said were worthy of the death penalty?That would seem to warrant a much stronger response than I know nothing about it.He knew enough about it in 2010 to recommend that the people involved be put to death, after all.To the extent that Trump doesnt condemn WikiLeaks for its 2010 actions like he did back then even now that Assange has been charged the more hypocritical and politically expedient it will look.The president who seems to have taken Russian leader Vladimir Putins word over his own intelligence communitys will effectively be giving a pass to a man who Trumps own government says conspired to release documents in a way that Trump once said warranted capital punishment.The president will continue to be asked about this.But the answers wont get any easier.
Divided Supreme Court says execution can proceed — but the death warrant had already expired:::::Conservative justices on the Supreme Court overruled lower courts in a middle-of-the-night order and said an Alabama execution could proceed, over the objections of their liberal colleagues who wanted to discuss the case Friday morning.The order came too late for the state to carry out the execution of Christopher Lee Price, and Alabama will have to ask a state court to set another execution date.But the 5-to-4 ruling at the Supreme Court indicated that the courts new conservative majority is far less likely to agree to last-minute stay requests from those facing execution.It also emphasized the stark divide between conservative and liberal justices on capital punishment and the most humane way to carry it out.[Divided Supreme Court rules against inmate with rare condition] What is at stake in this case is the right of a condemned inmate not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment, wrote Justice Stephen G. Breyer, objecting to the majoritys decision.He added: To proceed in this matter in the middle of the night without giving all members of the court the opportunity for discussion tomorrow morning is, I believe, unfortunate.An undated file photo of Christopher Lee Price.(Alabama Department of Corrections/AP) He was joined by his fellow liberal colleagues Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.Price, sentenced to death for his role in murdering an Alabama minister in 1991 with a sword and a dagger, was asking to be executed by inhaling nitrogen gas, a process called nitrogen hypoxia, rather than risk a botched execution by injection.Alabama allows nitrogen hypoxia but has never used it in an execution.But the Supreme Court majority said Price had missed his chance to elect that manner of death.In a brief, unsigned order, the courts conservatives said that death-row inmates in Alabama in June 2018 were given 30 days to elect nitrogen hypoxia.While 48 inmates did so, Price did not.He then waited until February 2019 to file this action and submitted additional evidence today, a few hours before his scheduled execution time, said the order from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh.That majority earlier this year allowed the execution of a Muslim inmate in Alabama who had complained that he was not allowed an imam by his side at his death, while Christian inmates could have a chaplain with them.The five justices suggested the legal action had come too late.[Supreme Courts execution decision animates critics on left and right] The conservatives also recently rejected an appeal from a Missouri inmate who said that lethal injection in his case could cause excruciating pain such that perhaps he would choke on his own blood during the process.The court ruled 5 to 4 that Russell Bucklew had not proven that lethal injection would choke him or that another manner of execution would alleviate the problem.Breyers dissent revealed the behind-the-scenes maneuvering that accompanies execution stay requests.Should anyone doubt that death sentences in the United States can be carried out in an arbitrary way, let that person review the following circumstances as they have been presented to our court this evening, Breyer wrote.After Price obtained stays from a district judge and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, the state of Alabama asked the Supreme Court to intervene after 9 p.m. Thursday.Breyer wrote that he requested the court take no action until Friday, when the justices were scheduled to meet in private conference to discuss other matters.I recognized that my request would delay resolution of the application and that the state would have to obtain a new execution warrant, thus delaying the execution by 30 days, Breyer wrote.But in my judgment, that delay was warranted, at least on the facts as we have them now.But he said the majority would not agree to that, thus preventing full discussion among the courts members.In doing so, it overrides the discretionary judgment of not one, but two lower courts.Why?The courts ruling was emailed to reporters at 2:51 a.m. Friday.While the deliberations proceeded in Washington, Alabama officials decided to halt Prices execution just before the death warrant expired at midnight.That left them angry as well.This evening, the state of Alabama witnessed a miscarriage of justice, Gov.Kay Ivey (R) said in a statement.
Poll shows rebound in Trump’s job approval after release of Mueller report summary:::::President Trump stops to talk to members of the media as he walks to Marine One to depart from the South Lawn at the White House last month.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) President Trumps job approval rating has rebounded since the release of a summary of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs findings related to Russian interference in the 2016 election, according to a new poll.A Gallup survey released Friday finds that 45 percent of Americans approve of Trumps job performance, up from 39 percent in March.While more Americans 51 percent continue to disapprove of the presidents performance than approve of it, the latest approval figure matches two previous highs in Gallup polling.Trumps earlier 45 percent readings came during his first week in office in January 2017 and in June 2018 after his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.[Trumps approval is back at the upper end of a very narrow window] According to a four-page summary of top-line findings of Muellers report provided to Congress on March 24 by Attorney General William P. Barr, Trump and his campaign did not illegally coordinate with Russia, but Mueller left open the question of whether Trump obstructed justice.Barr announced that he had concluded that Trump did not commit obstruction.The attorney generals brief account also quoted the Mueller report as saying, While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.Since then, Trump nevertheless has repeatedly claimed total exoneration, while Democrats are increasingly accusing Barr of providing political cover for the president.Barr has pledged to release a redacted version of the Mueller report in coming days.[Trump shares an inaccurate graphic on Twitter that overstates his job approval by 12 points] Gallup found that Trumps job approval remained unchanged from last month among Republicans, with about 9 in 10 approving of his performance.The increase in Trumps overall rating is the result of single-digit increases in approval among independents and Democrats, of 6 percentage points and 4 percentage points respectively, Gallup said.Another poll conducted after the release of Barrs summary, for the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service, found Trumps job approval to be 43 percent, largely unchanged from 42 percent in March 2018.On Thursday, Trump shared an inaccurate graphic on Twitter that said his overall approval rating was 55 percent.The graphic was produced by the Fox Business Network and broadcast the night before on Lou Dobbs Tonight.After Trumps tweet, the network offered multiple on-air corrections, including one from Dobbs, who said he wanted to repair something I got wrong.The graphic with the incorrect number remained in Trumps Twitter feed as of Friday morning.An Economist-YouGov poll released this week also found Trumps job approval to be 43 percent, down slightly from an average of 45 percent in March polling.Emily Guskin contributed to this report.
The Energy 202: Here's how Republicans want to address a water law that's choking new pipelines:::::THE LIGHTBULB President Trump displays an executive order he signed Wednesday in Crosby, Texas.(Reuters/Carlos Barria) One of President Trump's biggest energy-related goals is to build more pipelines before he leaves office.But Republicans are concerned the way a piece of half-century-old water pollution law is being used is thwarting those efforts.So the GOP is launching a double-barreled effort from both the White House and Congress to address a key provision in the Clean Water Act, the nations bedrock environmental statute for preventing water pollution.At issue is the law's Section 401, which gives states the power to disapprove interstate infrastructure projects that they deem potentially harmful to their waterways.Republicans allege that some states mostly left-leaning ones led by Democrats opposed to increasing the use of coal, oil and natural gas have abused the provision in recent years to stop the construction of pipelines and other energy infrastructure within their borders.The tension was on display Wednesday, when Trump flew to oil- and gas-rich Texas to sign an executive order directing the Environmental Protection Agency to review federal rules around states ability to issue water permits.Too often, badly needed energy infrastructure is being held back by special-interest groups, entrenched bureaucracies and radical activists, Trump said during a speech this week outside Houston, The Post's Toluse Olorunnipa and Steven Mufson report.But here's the fine print: Outdated Federal guidance and regulations regarding section 401 of the Clean Water Act, however, are causing confusion and uncertainty and are hindering the development of energy infrastructure, Trumps executive order states.Trump tasked the agency with tightening the amount of time states have to review water-permit applications as well the types of conditions that may be appropriate to include in a certification.Section 401 says that states must approve or reject projects within a reasonable period of time (which shall not exceed one year)."In practice, though, projects can last for years in permitting limbo as state-level environmental agencies go back and forth with companies to grapple with technical details.These projects that are subject to approval are massive, said Kimberly Ong, a senior attorney for the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, which opposes Trump's executive orders.They require extremely technical review.At the same time this week, the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), introduced legislation that goes a step further by etching into law some of those limits.The idea is to use the Clean Water Act for something to do with water, Barrasso said in an interview.Barrasso praised Trumps executive order, but wanted to make sure future administrations could not undo it.You're trying to codify this stuff to make it into law.His bill, for example, would limit states to considering only potential pollution from discharges into waterways when reviewing permit applications and not from other sources.That would mean the state of New York would not have been able to reject a proposed 124-mile gas pipeline on the grounds that construction would disturb creeks and streams, as the administration of Gov.Andrew M. Cuomo (D-N.Y.) has done.The state of Washington, similarly, rejected a water permit for export terminals for coal bound for use outside the state.Democratic Gov.Jay Inslee, who is running for president on a plank focused on climate change, denounced Trumps order as a dangerous attack on the environment.But Trump singled out the pipeline delays in his home state when announcing his administrative action.We need help with New York, Trump said.New York is hurting the country because they are not allowing us to get these pipelines through.That pipeline would have helped deliver fracked gas from Pennsylvanias Marcellus Shale to New England, which often must import liquefied natural gas from abroad during cold winter months.Yet Trump's executive order may yet still concern some red-state leaders.In a letter before Trumps announcement, the nonpartisan Western Governors Association, which represents 22 governors from 19 Western states and three U.S. territories, warned that overriding state agencies would inflict serious harm to the division of state and federal authorities established by Congress.But it is already earning praise from those in the oil and gas industry, who have pressed for years for New York to stop standing in the way of gas pipelines.If the systems are used, if you will, to obstruct the development of much-needed infrastructure, then we will push, as I know others will, to make sure theres certainty and predictability in the process, said then American Petroleum Industry president Jack Gerard last year, singling out New York.Some hydroelectric dam proposals have ended up waited for a decade or more for state water permits.Those developers are happy about the new push, too.Linda Church Ciocci, head of the National Hydropower Association, cheered the order for sending a clear message today that it is no longer acceptable for our nations vital hydropower projects to linger in uncertainty for years at times, a decade or more without resolution.The water is reversing the usual roles of the two parties, as Democrats find themselves defending states right to halt development within their borders and Republicans calling for federal regulators to play a bigger role in dictating state decision-making.We will all need to stand by a commitment to this federal-state partnership, Thomas R. Carper (Del.), the top Democrat on Barrasso's committee, which oversees the EPA, said in a speech earlier this week to state regulators.I and Im sure you see many other instances where cooperative federalism and respect for states rights doesnt mean the same thing to this administration as it does to those of you who are actually doing the work of environmental protection.Like with other Trump-era environmental rules, some legal experts expect whatever new rules the EPA issues to face significant courtroom challenges on administrative-law grounds.There are a number of ways it can be attacked, said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond.What Trump wants to do is cut the states out because theyre a pain in the neck.For now, though, environmental groups appear to be holding their legal fire until the EPA rolls out actual regulations.Trump ordered the rules to be finalized within the next 13 months.POWER PLAYS The Senate on Thursday confirmed David Bernhard to the Interior secretary post.(Chris Kleponis/Pool via Bloomberg) No longer acting: The Senate confirmed former lobbyist David Bernhardt to permanently lead the Interior Department, The Posts Darryl Fears reports.In a 56-to-41 vote, the Senate promoted Bernhardt who has been leading the agency in an acting capacity since Ryan Zinke resigned in the midst of several ethics investigations.Republicans lauded his long record of pulic service for the Trump and George W. Bush administrations, while Democrats focused on concerns about conflicts of interest due to his previous work as a lobbyist for the oil and gas industry and for large water districts.As The Post has reported, his potential conflicts are so extensive that he carries an index card listing the companies or people he should avoid.Four members of the Democratic caucus joined every Republican to vote for Trump nominee.One of those Democrats, Martin Heinrich (N.M.), explained his support like this: I need to be able to pick up the phone and talk to the secretary of interior on a regular, regular basis because these things have direct impacts on New Mexico, Heinrich said Wednesday.We didnt win the election in 2016, so Im not going to get my choice for secretary of interior.In the meantime, I have to be able to work with these folks.Bill Wehrum, the Environmental Protection Agency's top air policy official.(Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) House panel launches probe of EPA air chief: The House Energy and Commerce Committee is looking into whether the Environmental Protection Agencys air policy chief and his deputy have improperly helped former clients since they joined the Trump administration.Both Bill Wehrum, the assistant administrator for the EPAs Office of Air and Radiation, and his offices senior counsel, David Harlow previously worked at law firm Hunton & Williams, now called Hunton Andrew Kurth.On Thursday, committee chairman Frank Pallone Jr (D-N.J.), Dianna DeGette (D-Color.)and Paul Tonko (D-N.Y.) sent nine letters to businesses affiliated with the pair.In letters to the firm as well as eight power companies that belong to the Utility Air Regulatory Group, the lawmakers say that the agenda of Wehrums office appears remarkably similar to the substantive agenda advanced by the organization that the EPA assistant administrator used to represent in private practice, The Posts Juliet Eilperin reports.Sen.

Pence says Trump ‘welcomes information’ but didn’t endorse WikiLeaks in 2016:::::Vice President Pence holds a news briefing after addressing the United Nations Security Council on April 10, 2019, at U.N. headquarters.(Bebeto Matthews/AP) Vice President Pence asserted in an interview broadcast Friday that President Trumps enthusiastic reaction to WikiLeaks releases of damaging material on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential race did not amount to an endorsement of the organization.I think the president always, as you and the media do, always welcomes information, Pence said in an interview with CNN.But that was in no way an endorsement of an organization that we now understand was involved in disseminating classified information by the United States of America.His comments followed the arrest Thursday of the organizations founder, Julian Assange, by British authorities in response to a U.S. extradition request.In an indictment unsealed Thursday, Assange was accused of conspiring in 2010 with Chelsea Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst then known as Bradley Manning, and others to hack a Defense Department computer to illegally obtain secret U.S. military information.During the closing stretch of the 2016 campaign, Trump repeatedly extolled WikiLeaks at his rallies for sharing hacked emails from Clintons campaign chairman, John Podesta.[Trump disavows past enthusiasm for WikiLeaks after Assanges arrest] WikiLeaks I love WikiLeaks, Trump said at one such event.This WikiLeaks is like a treasure trove, he said at another.I love reading those WikiLeaks, he said at yet another event, relating that he had been delayed in arriving because he had been reading the latest batch of emails that WikiLeaks had released.NBC News tallied that Trump cited WikiLeaks 141 times at 56 events in the last month of the campaign.WikiLeaks began releasing hacked emails from Podesta on the same day in October 2016 that The Washington Post reported the existence of an Access Hollywood tape in which Trump bragged about inappropriately grabbing women.Trump sought Thursday to disavow his past enthusiasm about WikiLeaks, telling reporters in the Oval Office: I know nothing about WikiLeaks.Its not my thing.In the CNN interview broadcast Friday, Pence said the Justice Department is seeking to bring Julian Assange to justice.The Australian WikiLeaks founder was involved in one of the greatest compromises of classified information in American history, Pence said.
The Cybersecurity 202: Security experts irked U.S. prosecutors used anti-hacking law to nab Julian Assange:::::Want more cybersecurity news and analysis in your inbox?Sign up for The Cybersecurity 202.THE KEY WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is seen as he leaves a police station in London on April 11.(Peter Nicholls/Reuters) A faction of lawyers and cybersecurity experts are irked by the way prosecutors used the country's main anti-hacking law to bring charges against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.They say it's a stretch to use the 35-year-old Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to nab Assange for the alleged crime offering to help Chelsea Manning decipher a password so she could get greater access to a military database and pass more secrets to WikiLeaks.And even that alleged crime, they say, is the mark of some crafty legal maneuvering since prosecutors couldnt bring charges against Assange for what actually riled them that WikiLeaks published secret information that threw U.S. diplomatic relations into chaos in 2010 and upended the presidential election in 2016 without undermining First Amendment free speech protections.In other words, its a little like getting Al Capone for tax evasion if the evidence of tax evasion was pretty tenuous.It's clear that this prosecution isn't substantially driven by any CFAA violation that may or may not have occurred, David Segal, co-founder of the liberal advocacy group Demand Progress, told me.Rather, an alleged such violation is being used to de facto prosecute for the publication of leaked materials.Indeed, its highly unlikely the government would have bothered to indict and seek to extradite from England someone who wasnt Julian Assange for trying, but evidently failing, to assist in a computer hack, as Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow focused on technology and privacy at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed out on Twitter.Also, of course, it seems inconceivable DOJ would put the effort they have into extraditing someone who had merely agreed to run a password hash against some rainbow tables for another intruder.Julian Sanchez (@normative) April 11, 2019 Experts' criticism isn't so much about sympathy for Assange as it is irritation that the CFAA's broad language which predates the modern Internet can be bent and twisted to fit a lot of things involving computers that seem pretty innocuous.The creative use of it to grab Assange only highlights for them the cloud of legal menace often faced by legitimate security researchers who use hacking to point out cybersecurity vulnerabilities.And it's a reminder that prosecutors have used the law before to aggressively prosecute activists.CFAA is a ridiculously broad statute or, at least it has been interpreted that way by many courts, Jeffrey Vagle, an affiliate scholar at Stanford Universitys Center for Internet and Society, told me.It was written in a completely different era with respect to how we use computers.It was not a well-thought-out law, and thats come back to haunt us.A provision that bars exceed[ing] authorized access on a computer, for example, can be read to apply to simply violating a website's terms of service such as by lying about your age in an online form.That provision was what the Justice Department relied on to prosecute Aaron Swartz, an Internet activist who violated JSTORs terms of service by using an automated program to download troves of public-access academic journals from the online database.Swartz, an advocate for broad public access to information, wanted to demonstrate that the online database limited access to academic articles to institutions that could pay high fees.Swartz faced up to 50 years behind bars and a fine of $1 million but committed suicide in 2013 before his case went to trial.That was just one of numerous prosecutions that activists deemed questionable under the law, as my colleague Brian Fung detailed.Another example: In 2016, journalist Matthew Keys ...was sentenced to two years behind bars under the law.Keys, who formerly worked for Tribune Media, was convicted under the CFAA for passing computer login information to the digital activist group Anonymous, which then used the login to alter an online Los Angeles Times article, Brian reported.Companies have also used civil portions of the law to threaten ethical hackers who try to find and publicize bugs in their software that can violate customers privacy.In Assanges case the charges deal with a specific CFAA provision focused on classified government materials, as University of Southern California Law Professor Orin Kerr outlined on Twitter: Second, it's based on a relatively aggressive (and somewhat controversial) view of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act -- that accessing files in violation of an order on classified materials is an unauthorized access.Orin Kerr (@OrinKerr) April 11, 2019 The same interpretation of the same provision was used to convict Manning in a military tribunal, Kerr pointed out, but prosecutors will have a tougher time making the case in a civilian courtroom.Prosecutors are also tacking on a separate charge related to terrorism in order to extend the statue of limitations for the hacking crime -- which is normally five years -- to the eight years Assange has been holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London as CFAA-focused attorney Tor Ekeland pointed out on Twitter.So, basically, they're saying that the SOL is 8 years because the 18 U.S.C.1030(a)(1) CFAA charge is listed as an act of terrorism under 18 U.S.C.2332bg(5)(b)(i).Got that?https://t.co/25NaYSToVf If true, they filed the indictment in the nick of time (3/6/18) #Assange Tor Ekeland (@TorEkelandPLLC) April 11, 2019 There have been efforts to update CFAA, most notably by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) who introduced a bill after Swartzs death to narrow the laws scope.The bill, which would have removed exceeding authorized access as an offense, was colloquially known as Aarons Law.It did not pass, Brian reported.PINGED, PATCHED, PWNED Russian President Vladimir Putin.(Dmitri Lovetsky/AP) PINGED: Russias disinformation efforts during the 2016 presidential campaign targeted Bernie Sanders supporters more than was previously known, my colleague Michael Kranish reported Friday.At the Posts request, Clemson University researchers examined a trove of Russian-originated tweets that appeared designed to urge Sanders supporters to fall in line behind President Trump rather than Hillary Clinton after the Vermont senator dropped out of the race.It is impossible to say how many [tweets] were targeted at Sanders supporters because many dont include his name, Michael reported.Some 9,000 of the Russian tweets used the word Bernie, which were liked 59,281 times and retweeted 61,804 times.But that was only one element of the Russian effort to target Sanders supporters, the researchers said.Many thousands of other tweets, with no direct reference to Sanders, were also designed to appeal to his backers, urging them to do anything but vote for Clinton in the general election.Heres a take from one of the Clemson researchers, Darren Linvill, associate professor of communications: I think there is no question that Sanders was central to their strategy.He was clearly used as a mechanism to decrease voter turnout for Hillary Clinton, The tweets examined in the new analysis give us a much clearer understanding of the tactics they were using.It was certainly a higher volume than people thought.U.S. Deputy Assistant secretary for Cyber and International Communications and Information Policy Robert Strayer, right, and Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission.(Manu Fernandez/AP) PATCHED: A United Nations agency has sent formal invitations to representatives from 25 nations including the United States, Russia and China to participate in a dialogue about rules of the road in cyberspace that will launch later this year.Timo S.

Early fundraising by 2020 Democrats shows they are in for a long, drawn-out fight:::::Sen. Kamala Harris, a candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, addresses labor leaders at the California Labor Federal and State Building and Construction Trades Council Legislative Conference Dinner on April 1.(Rich Pedroncelli/AP) The limited early fundraising hauls announced by Democratic presidential hopefuls show that no clear front-runner has yet emerged in the race, and portend a drawn-out and divisive primary slog before the party unifies against President Trump.The overall sum raised by nearly 20 Democratic presidential candidates so far is on par with the amount raised by a much smaller field at this point in 2007, a sign that candidates are struggling to break through in a crowded contest that remains wildly unpredictable.The first-quarter fundraising reports that will be made public next week are typically seen as a key early measure of viability for primary candidates.But the figures trickling out from the campaigns show Democratic voters dont yet know where to channel their anti-Trump energy and money.Democratic campaigns have raised at least $64.5 million in the first quarter, according to figures released by eight of the 16 campaigns reporting this period, which is less than the amount raised by candidates in the 2007 field.Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) reported the biggest haul, at $18.2 million, followed by $12 million by Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and $9.4 million by former congressman Beto ORourke (Tex.).Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., reportedly raised $7 million a large haul for a newcomer to national politics.Three senators raised less than Buttigieg: Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts ($6 million), Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota ($5.2 million) and Cory Booker ($5 million).Among those who have not released their early numbers are Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julin Castro.One reason for the relatively modest totals is that many wealthy donors and fundraisers are sitting on the sidelines waiting for former vice president Joe Biden to join the field, or simply watching to see who rises and who flames out.Also, many of the candidates have focused on wooing donors who give in small increments online.Some Democratic strategists expressed concern about the early figures, which they described as lackluster.Rufus Gifford, finance director for Barack Obamas 2012 reelection campaign, said campaigns are hindering themselves by failing to maximize all sources of money, which includes courting wealthier donors willing to give up to the limit of $2,800.Their support, he said, will be crucial once the nominee is selected.I dont think that we can find these numbers acceptable, considering where the energy of the country is, and the stakes in 2020, Gifford said.I want the strongest candidate with the best chance to beat Trump, and I dont want [a lack of] money to be a factor there.Jim Messina, Obamas 2012 campaign manager, called some of the numbers worrying particularly from Warren, who put herself at a fundraising disadvantage when she pledged not to hold fundraisers with donors who write bigger checks.He said it will be particularly important for candidates to raise a lot of money early in the campaign this year because the Democratic primary calendar has changed, moving up two of the biggest and most expensive primaries: California and Texas.The eventual nominee will go up against a foe who has been aggressively fundraising for two years, with no primary to spend on so far.By the end of last year, Trumps campaign had raised more than $129 million for his reelection an enormous sum that gives him a formidable head start that has likely widened in the first quarter of this year.[Trump enters the 2020 election cycle with a massive fundraising lead over Democrats] Trumps record-breaking reelection cash haul has allowed the Republican Party to finesse its data program to better engage voters.Still, in the age of social media and viral content, it is unclear whether a candidate needs to break fundraising records to gain traction.For instance, in 2016, Trump emerged from a crowded Republican primary where he was outspent by others but gained attention through viral tweets and headline-grabbing debate moments.And some longtime Democratic fundraisers say they have no doubt the money spigot will open as soon as the field settles.It just may take several more months for candidates to gain traction.People shouldnt overreact to the totality of the numbers.What it does say is that there are a lot of high-quality people running for president this time, said Tom Nides, former deputy secretary of state under Obama and a longtime Democratic fundraiser.The Democrats whoever is the nominee will ultimately have plenty of money to raise and win against Trump.That Im sure of.That means the stakes are higher for candidates to deliver a stellar performance at the first Democratic National Committee debate in June, their first high-profile chance at distinguishing themselves to voters.There are signs the money is out there.Some freshman House Democrats raised significant amounts this quarter, according to early figures from their campaigns.For instance, Rep. Josh Harder (D-Calif.), who took office in January, said he has already raised $800,000 toward his reelection in 2020.The first-quarter fundraising reports come at time of vigorous debate in the party over which donors should have the biggest say in the primaries.[Its the metric, 100 percent.Democratic presidential hopefuls increasingly see small-dollar donations as a sign of viability.]In the past, candidates who drew the most money from wealthy donors early in the campaign were seen as the most competitive.This year, candidates are eschewing rich donors writing $2,800 checks and emphasizing online donors who give less than $200 at a time.At this point in previous presidential cycles, bundlers who collect big checks on behalf of presidential candidates would pay to attend cocktail hours and lunches hosted by campaigns, and commit to raising millions of dollars for a primary candidate.But now, several bundlers said, they are attending more free informational events to learn about the candidates.One longtime Hillary Clinton fundraiser, who requested anonymity because he is still weighing whom to support, said he is receiving pitches from various campaigns and is attending events to meet candidates.He said he is looking for candidates who have passion, authenticity and policy chops, but is not in a rush to commit to helping one candidate.I helped Kamala [Harris], I sent emails about Cory [Booker], Im helping a friend blast out her email for [John] Hickenlooper, he said.Were just so catatonic with the daily horror of the Trump administration.We just want to win, but we cant move yet until we know how were going to win.The vast majority of the partys largest bundlers and fundraisers are in the same boat.At a donor gathering last month in Miami, Messina asked 107 of the Democratic Partys biggest bundlers whether they had committed to a presidential candidate.Just four raised their hand, he said.Everyone kind of started laughing, and I think its an assessment from the party that some people believe they moved too fast to anoint a candidate in 2016, Messina said.There are so many good candidates that people are going to wait to see who performs and who some of the breakout stars are.Longtime party bundlers who spent years raising money from the vast Clinton donor network, or were drawn to the star power of Obama, said they are not yet enthusiastic enough about any of the declared candidates.Its really hard when you found the guy who you thought was terrific and was terrific, had two outstanding elections to find somebody else like that, said one longtime Obama bundler who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private fundraising conversations.The most likely choice for many Obama and Clinton fundraisers and donors is Biden.He has told some donors and fundraisers that he intends to announce his run by the end of the month.But even then, they question whether Biden would be able to survive a primary contest, noting that his four-decade political career poses both an asset and a liability and citing recent allegations by women that he touched them inappropriately.Three to four weeks ago, all of us were thinking Biden was a safe bet.But then he had this Creepy Joe Biden, sniffing-hair-and-kissing-heads thing.Thats a cautionary tale for big Democratic fundraisers, the Clinton bundler said.The Biden issue shows the dangers of jumping on board with a candidate early.

The Health 202: Republicans want to look like pioneers on preexisting conditions protections:::::THE PROGNOSIS Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina (Al Drago/Bloomberg Republicans who say they hate Obamacare are scrambling to introduce legislation protecting Americans with preexisting conditions.But its precisely because of the health-care law that they embraced such protections in the first place.Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), one of the Senates most vulnerable Republicans in 2020, reintroduced a bill this week banning health insurers from refusing coverage to such patients, charging them more or denying coverage for their specific treatment protections already extended in the Affordable Care Act.Tillis and his bills 17 GOP co-sponsors want badly to look like pioneers on the issue, after Democrats effectively attacked them over preexisting conditions in last years elections.But that's a hard image to craft as Democrats already blazed that trail back in 2010 when they passed the health-care law.Now everyone Republicans and Democrats say they support a framework where everyone with a preexisting health condition would be protected, Kathleen Sebelius, who was Health and Human Services secretary at the time, told me yesterday.That was not the case prior to the ACA.President Obama signs the Affordable Health Care in 2010.(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) People talk about that as if that has always been the situation, Sebelius added.It couldnt be further from the truth.Before the ACA, Americans buying insurance on their own without the help of an employer were often rejected by health insurers if they were deemed too risky or expensive to cover.This included people with conditions like diabetes, cancer, heart disease or anything that would make them a less-than-ideal customer.I have watched people be turned down, said Sebelius, who served as Kansass insurance commissioner from 1995 to 2003.Today, that is almost a given, the thought that health-care is more a right than a privilege and should be accessible to everyone in the United States.Case in point: The countrys four largest for-profit health insurers Aetna, Humana, UnitedHealth Group and WellPoint denied coverage to more than 651,000 people over a three-year period due to preexisting conditions, according to a congressional investigation released in October 2010 by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.Democrats writing the ACA insisted that guaranteeing coverage to everyone must be a core component of health reform.Republicans held mixed opinions on the topic but an alternative bill offered by House Republicans at the time did not explicitly prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people because of preexisting conditions, instead setting up high-risk pools for such patients.An alternative bill from Senate Republicans did include the protection.Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testifies before a House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing in 2013.REUTERS/Jim Bourg Nine years after the health-care law was passed, its inconceivable that any politician would publicly admit they dont support preexisting condition protections.The ACA has ensconced these protections in the countrys health insurance system, forcing Republicans to jump on board after the fact.The issue has been a top political topic over the past year because of the Trump administrations refusal to defend the health-care law in a lawsuit aiming to knock down the entire health-care law including its preexisting condition protections.That has put Republicans in a precarious position, walking a fine line between supporting the president while insisting they support that popular part of the ACA.President Trump, despite directing his Justice Department to oppose the ACA and its consumer protections, tweeted this last year: Republicans will protect people with pre-existing conditions far better than the Dems!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2018 Some Republicans in last years races even cast themselves as the originators of preexisting conditions protections, neglecting to mention those protections are already guaranteed via the ACA.An ad run by Sen.

Sun and Gabrielle Paluch report.[T]he refusal of some parents to vaccinate their children a decision not based on any religious proscription and a resulting measles outbreak have brought public health authorities to their doorsteps in a collision of cultures that could turn messy, they write.This week, the city sent more than a dozen disease detectives into the community to conduct interviews with people who may have been exposed to measles and to check immunization records of those they had contact with.Health Department spokeswoman Marcy Miranda said there are 1,800 unvaccinated Orthodox Jewish students with religious exemptions in the four Zip codes the city has targeted.In Williamsburg, the attention is becoming a sore spot for some in a community that would rather be left alone, our colleagues write.David Oberlander, principal of a yeshiva where measles was discovered in the outbreak, insisted ninety-seven percent of our students and family are vaccinated.But John Marshall, chairman of emergency medicine at Maimonides Medical Center in the area said it certainly cant be 98 or 99 percent.If there were 90 percent of people immunized in the community, it wouldnt be spreading.OxyContin pills arranged for a photo at a pharmacy, in Montpelier, Vt. (AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File) OUCH: At the peak of the opioid crisis, sales representatives from Purdue Pharma swarmed the state of New York, making half a million visits to doctors and pharmacies between 2006 and 2017 to promote the companys painkillers, including OxyContin, the New York Timess William K. Rashbaum, Roni Caryn Rabin and Danny Hakim report.The details of such sales tactics were disclosed in court documents filed yesterday by the states Attorney General Letitia James in a lawsuit against opioid makers, distributors and several members of the family that owns Purdue.The disclosures also revealed Purdue employees were aware as early as 1999 just how much patients were abusing OxyContin, and also knew and shared internal emails about the methods used to abuse the drug.In a statement, Purdue Pharma said the new court filing contains factual errors and gross distortions and misrepresentations based on highly selective excerpting of language from tens of millions of documents.The complaint is designed to publicly vilify Purdue and its former directors, William, Roni and Danny write, adding the new court filing also reveals Purdue wasnt the only drugmaker with a similar sales strategy.A supervisor at another company, Ireland-based Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals that manufactures branded and generic opioids, called on his sales staff to ATTACK, the filing finds, and told them big bonus dollars were available to representatives who waited at the doors of health care providers.(AP Photo/Jim Mone, file) A UnitedHealthcare executives remarks at an employee town hall sheds light on how the health insurer has been working to weaken support for Medicare-for-all.One of the things you said: Were really quiet or It seems like were quiet.Um, weve done a lot more than you would think, chief executive Steve Nelson said in response to a question about the companys efforts in the Medicare-for-all debate, according to a video of his remarks obtained by our Post colleague Jeff Stein.You want to be kind of thoughtful about how you show up and have these kind of conversations, because the last thing you want to do is become the poster child during the presidential campaign."As we've written frequently in Health 202, there's a larger push from the health care industry to block Medicare-for-all proposals that could put private insurance companies out of business and reduce payments to providers.Wary of bringing unwanted political controversy to their companies, some private health-care firms have in part relied on advocacy groups and lobbyists in their fight against Medicare-for-all joining the push without leaving too many company-specific fingerprints, Jeff writes.HEALTH ON THE HILL Sen.

Congress scorns Trump plan to cut, weaponize foreign aid:::::Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, right, greets Faustin-Archange Touadera, president of the Central African Republic, at the State Department on Thursday.(Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images) Columnist Mark Green did his best to put a winning face on a losing proposition.The administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) told Congress about a proposed increase in his budget and funding for a program that will allow us to maintain the highest level ever of U.S. humanitarian assistance programming.But Democrats and Republicans at Tuesdays House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing saw right through Greens masquerade.They can read budgets and theyre aware of the Trump administrations plans to significantly cut foreign assistance.Congress has ignored larger proposed cuts twice before, a fate that surely awaits the current plan.More than numbers, the budget represents a steady American retreat from global leadership and an attempt to weaponize foreign assistance.(Trump last month announced the end of foreign aid to countries in Central America, accusing those governments of purposely sending migrant caravans to the United States.)Greens attempt to disguise the Trump administrations planned 24 percent cut in the international affairs budget was clear from the second sentence of his statement.He touted a $19.2 billion budget plan for his agency as an increase of $2.4 billion, or 14 percent, over last years request.But that comparison is misleading.The proposal floated Tuesday actually represents a decrease from the $24.5 billion Congress approved for the agencys budget.Greens talk of the highest level ever of humanitarian assistance contrasts with the reality of Trumps plan to collapse several programs into one and drop overall funding by a third, according to an analysis by the U.S.Global Leadership Coalition, which advocates for strong international funding.Now is not the time to slash effective, lifesaving programs that help create a safer and more secure world, said InterAction, an alliance of international organizations.Committee Chairman Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.) didnt buy Greens line.Engel listed the damage that would result from Trumps foreign assistance budget: Core humanitarian accounts and democracy and governance programs slashed by 40 percent.Maternal and child health programs cut by a quarter.Food security, nutrition assistance, basic education all chopped by roughly half.Food for Peace zeroed out completely.What an ugly picture this budget paints of America, he said at the hearing.It was a bipartisan rejection of Trumps plan.The top Republican on the committee, Rep. Michael McCaul (Tex.), told Green that development and humanitarian assistance cuts can cost us more in the medium and long term.When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared in March before the House Appropriations subcommittee on state, foreign operations, and related programs, he got an earful from Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.).She was upset not just about the budget proposal, but about Trumps insolence toward black nations, an attitude reflected in his budget.Complaining about his planned cuts to African aid, Lee said they follow a well-documented track record from the president identifying certain countries as s-hole countries.Like Trumps insistence that NATO members increase contributions to the defense alliance, Green urged others to do their part in humanitarian assistance.Thats ironic, because Uncle Sam falls far short of doing his part.Under Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. rate of development assistance has been well below the United Nations target of 0.7 percent of gross national income.The U.S. contribution is a paltry 0.17 percent, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Lees legislation would boost U.S. assistance to 1 percent of gross domestic product, a similar economic measure of the nations wealth.The $34 billion in development assistance the United States contributed in 2018 is much more than any other nation.But it should be.The United States is the richest nation.Furthermore, most of those billions flow through U.S. outfits.Approximately 70 percent of all U.S. foreign assistance is implemented through U.S. organizations, according to the State Department.As important as that assistance is, as much good as it does, it represents Uncle Sams pocket change less than 1 percent of his budget.One example of the good it does is in the fight against HIV/AIDS.The Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), launched by President George W. Bush in 2003, helped save 17 million lives and ensured 2.4 million babies have been born HIV-free, according to a Global Leadership Coalition fact sheet.Trump, however, considers foreign aid a transactional exercise.President Trump has made it clear that U.S. foreign assistance should serve Americas interests, Pompeo told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Wednesday.The administration narrowly defines those interests and does not fully appreciate the role foreign assistance plays in boosting national security.Development assistance is a national security issue also, Lee said during an interview.We have three pillars of our national security development assistance, diplomacy and defense.That sentiment was echoed by 141 retired generals and admirals.Challenges cannot be solved by military force alone, they wrote in a letter to Congress last month opposing cuts to the international affairs budget.They will require strategic investments in development and diplomacy to tackle the root causes of conflict in order to succeed for the long term.Trumps transactional approach also can lead to shortsighted, counterproductive decisions, such as the one to cut assistance to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, the Central American countries the administration claims are not doing enough to stop migration.This weaponizes assistance by threatening to withhold it despite the humanitarian need.We deal in reality, Pompeo said.Its not enough to take taxpayer money and spend it there.You need to get something for that, and thats what we are engaged in now.This is the most generous nation in the history of civilization.Too generous, in Trumps view.Read more: With so many acting officials, we need a president who acts like one Domestic terrorism story renews fears over Trumps coddling of white nationalists State of the nation: Alleged white-supremacist killer finds inspiration in Trump Inspection finds ICE jails conditions endanger detainees health, safety Did ICE ignore health and safety standards for jailed immigrants?
Who will be angry when the Star Wars episode IX trailer drops today?:::::Star Wars enthusiasts huddle with their lightsabers at Taguig City, Philippines, on March 30.(Eloisa Lopez/Reuters) Star Wars episode IX is coming.On Friday, director J.J. Abrams addresses Star Wars Celebration, a fan convention, and is expected to reveal the full title and teaser footage for episode IX.Although no one yet knows what will be in it, we do know that fans and culture commentators will be heatedly and sometimes abusively discussing its politics for months.Since 2017, Ive repeatedly sampled Star Wars-related Twitter, gathering and analyzing about 250,000 tweets with language classification algorithms.Heres what the data reveals about who is going to be mad online about episode IX on the political right and left and why.Where are the white men?In right-wing media, the first questions about the teaser will be about white male and legacy characters from the original Star Wars trilogy.The right-wing critique of the newer films is that they are contemptuous of white, male and baby-boomer-era fans and that Lucasfilm has abbreviated legacy characters story lines and overemphasized diverse casting.As a result, my research finds, younger, female and nonwhite Star Wars characters are discussed in more abusive terms on social media than are older, white and male characters.Of the Star Wars tweets Ive collected, a Google algorithm ranks 6.5 percent as toxic.The least likely to include abusive language are tweets that do not mention major characters, with only 6 percent reaching toxic status.Tweets about the newer, female and nonwhite protagonists of the sequel trilogy are more likely to reach toxic status.Consider posts mentioning Poe Dameron, played by a Hispanic actor; Finn, a lead character whos black; Rey, a female lead; and/or Rose Tico, a major supporting character whos female and Asian.Of those, 13 percent are abusive.By contrast, tweets mentioning their older, white counterparts Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and/or Leia Organa (a legacy character, albeit a woman) use abusive language less, in 8 percent of cases.Those two categories can overlap: Some tweets mention an older and a younger protagonist.Over 20 percent of posts with that overlap use abusive language.Intergenerational anxiety runs through fights about Star Wars.If the episode IX teasers indicate legacy characters will have ample screen time, expect satisfaction from right-wing fandom.The right would be gratified if its bte noire Rose Tico is not in the footage.[Who hates Star Wars for its newfound diversity?Here are the numbers.]YouTube stress test YouTube is the main forum for right-wing Star Wars commentary videos.Fridays teaser will be a stress test for the Google-owned site.Thats because observers believe YouTubes recommendation algorithm promotes videos with extreme and misleading content, predicting that this content will keep people engaged.Last month, right-wing Internet activists called for boycotts of Captain Marvel because of conspiracy theories about insults to male fans and because a woman played a superhero who had been a man in the comic books.YouTube made modifications to prevent the boycott calls from spreading.Using tags, YouTube ensured searches for Marvel-related videos pointed to national news outlets channels instead of to user-provided content.If you see the episode IX teaser on YouTube, check what the site is recommending you watch next.If it is not user-generated content, YouTube may be repeating its Captain Marvel strategy.[Captain Marvel's smash success shows us that conservatives are ignoring the alt-right] Left-wing fans and the politics of romance While the right-wing Internet worries about white male representation in Star Wars, hints about romantic relationships are important to many left-wing fans.In fan culture, shipping means predicting or cheering for an amorous relationship (a ship) between two characters.For example, if someone ships Reylo, they are interested in a romantic relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren, her main antagonist.Shippers do not always expect to see their pairings in the source material.But the episode IX footage will be scrutinized for clues about which romances might make it on to the screen.Shippers are disproportionately women, teenagers and/or LGBTQ.For Star Wars and other franchises, the highest-profile fan communities cater to men.Shipping is usually derided or ignored there.Shippers political discussions lean left.Debates over the merits of specific pairings frequently concern progressive ideals.Ships may be denounced for being heteronormative; fetishizing homosexuality; excluding nonwhite characters; being anti-feminist; romanticizing violence or abuse; or modeling dysfunctional relationships.On Star Wars shipping Twitter, those conversations can become vicious.Star Wars tweets that mention a romantic ship are twice as likely to be toxic as tweets that dont 9 percent vs. 4 percent.Abusive tweets come both from people arguing against and in favor of various pairings.Among the widely discussed pairings, Reylo Twitter sees the highest rate of toxic posts, with a rate of 10 percent.Shipping Twitter highlights two biases in social media.First, abuse directed toward people of color, women, teenage girls and LGBTQ posters comes from people in those categories as well as from white, heterosexual men.Second, criticisms of shipping reflect an assumption that women and minorities bear primary responsibility for policing political and moral standards in popular culture.All the critiques above could apply to nonromantic parts of the Star Wars movies and fandom: sexism, ignoring people of color, rhapsodizing about villains and so on.But these criticisms are leveled more often and in more abusive terms when fans discuss romantic storylines.The last Skywalker The most closely guarded plot point of episode IX is whether Kylo Ren, the last Skywalker and the leader of the evil First Order, will redeem himself.Kylos redemption chafes on all sides of the debate about the place of young, white men in contemporary society.Right and left commentators alike compare Kylo to a millennial living in his parents basement.They disagree about what his story implies about gender politics.To the left, Kylo is an avatar of toxic masculinity.His redemption arc could be interpreted as an apologia for overprivileged mens anger and an example of the sympathy our culture reserves for white male extremists.Ironically, in right-leaning discussions, Kylo is considered effeminate: pampered, indecisive, easily defeated.His redemption would be a capitulation to his female rival (Rey) and his mom (Leia).These fans want Kylo defeated by a more heroically masculine character.The takes awaken Starting today, and lasting until episode IX premieres in December, well see sometimes belligerent political discussions of Star Wars its legacy characters, romantic pairings and disappointing adult sons.Heres the common thread: Anxiety over who has a place in our stories from the galaxy far, far away and closer to home.[Dystopian fiction makes people more willing to justify political violence.Should you worry?]Bethany Lacina (@bethany_lacina) is an associate professor of political science at the University of Rochester.
‘She’s very good with numbers’: Trump says he considered his daughter Ivanka to lead the World Bank:::::Ivanka Trump is recognized by President Trump at a White House event earlier this month.(Susan Walsh/AP) President Trump considered nominating his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, to be president of the World Bank in part because shes very good with numbers, according to a new interview published Friday.Speaking to the Atlantic, Trump lavished praise on his daughter, a 37-year-old White House adviser, and suggested she would be suitable for other administration positions, including U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.Shes a natural diplomat, Trump said.She wouldve been great at the United Nations, as an example.Asked why he didnt nominate her, Trump replied: If I did, theyd say nepotism, when it wouldve had nothing to do with nepotism.But she wouldve been incredible.Trump added: I even thought of Ivanka for the World Bank....She wouldve been great at that because shes very good with numbers.[There really is no equivalency: Ivanka Trump dismisses comparisons between her and Hillary Clintons email practices] Trump wound up nominating David Malpass, the Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, to be president of the World Bank in February.Malpass was unanimously approved by its executive board last week.In the Atlantic interview, the president also praised Ivanka Trump for possessing a great calmness.Ive seen her under tremendous stress and pressure, he said.She reacts very well thats usually a genetic thing, but its one of those things, nevertheless.If she ever wanted to run for president, I think shed be very, very hard to beat, Trump added.According to the Atlantic, Trump made clear he was also proud of his other children.Barron is young, but hes got wonderful potential, Trump said.And Tiffanys doing extremely well.Don is, uh, hes enjoying politics; actually, its very good.And Eric is running the business along with Don, and also very much into politics.I mean, the children the children have been very, very good.
Power Up: This is Elizabeth Warren’s Catch-22:::::We made it -- again!Happy Friday!Tips, comments, a recipe for the worlds best chocolate cake?Email me, sign up, and forward this to your friends.Have a great weekend Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)speaks at an event in Las Vegas on Feb. 17.(John Locher, File/AP Photo) The People A CATCH 22: Elizabeth Warren is a popular Massachusetts senator, an energetic campaigner, and armed with more fresh and ambitious proposals than any other 2020 presidential candidate.But two data points from this week show illustrate how Warren may be facing an uphill battle in the crowded field of Democrats.To the extent polling matters this far out ...: Polls released in last 48 hours from Iowa and New Hampshire show Warren trails behind Joe Biden , who hasnt formally entered the race; Bernie Sanders, who has the largest donor list network of the group; and South Bend, Ind.Mayor Pete Buttigieg , a relative unknown who has received a wave of positive press over the past month.Polls released in last 48 hours from Iowa and New Hampshire show Warren trails behind , who hasnt formally entered the race; who has the largest donor list network of the group; and South Bend,

Hampshire poll.Warren didn't break double digits in either poll; even Buttigieg did with his 11 percent in the New Hampshire poll.And there's the underwhelming first quarter fundraising haul: Warren brought in only $6 million, trailing well behind Sanders, Harris, Pete and Beto O'Rourke and Buttigieg.Warren brought in only $6 million, trailing well behind Sanders, Harris, Pete and Beto O'Rourke and Buttigieg.On the problem: We dont have to match other candidates dollar for dollar, but we do need a strong enough grass roots base to be able to keep Elizabeths voice front and center in this race, Roger Lau, Warrens campaign manager, said in an email to supporters.We spoke with academics, strategists and veteran operatives who suggest there's more going on here than a bad week.There are two dueling issues plaguing Warren's appeal, they say: There's a cloud of sexism in this race and voters just don't care so much about policy.At least, not as much as perhaps Warren would like.Warren is now facing a Catch-22: She is embracing policy over identity, as she's simultaneously penalized for her identity.I do think that there is an element of sexism, Lily Mason, an assistant professor of politics at the University of Maryland and the author of 'Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity,' told Power Up.Lily Mason, an assistant professor of politics at the University of Maryland and the author of 'Uncivil Agreement: How Politics Became Our Identity,' told Power Up.But also: The people who will talk about policy in a thoughtful and coherent way are at a disadvantage."Warren is by far the most policy savvy candidate with the smartest and best policy people working for her.In a rational world, she would be winning.But ...it's not a rational world and we tend to make political choices based on identity rather than policy.She's telling people who she is.But she's not making people think about who they are.In a rational world, she would be winning.She's telling people who she is.But she's not making people think about who they are.Policy talk: It's just not that exciting, Mason points out, because the language doesn't involve conflict, fighting, winning and losing."Lose-lose: A Democratic operative tells us that the voters that are paying the most attention this early in the race, and likely to vote in the primaries, tend to have the strongest focus on identity politics.This is where the last presidential race could have a boomerang effect on Warren.Women were less supportive of female candidates, and men less supportive of liberal candidates, after being told that Hillary Clinton lost because of her focus on identity politics, per a study by Seth Masket, the chairman of the political science department at the University of Denver on concerns about the role of women in American politics.That theory of Clinton's loss, of course, is a narrative that's been percolating since her unexpected loss in 2016. per a study by Seth Masket, the chairman of the political science department at the University of Denver on concerns about the role of women in American politics.That theory of Clinton's loss, of course, is a narrative that's been percolating since her unexpected loss in 2016.My impression is that the identity politics cue makes respondents less comfortable with the idea of Democrats nominating someone other than a white male in 2020, Masket wrote.Media coverage may play a role in enforcing this narrative: Female candidates running for president are consistently being described in the media more negatively than their male counterparts," per an analysis of 130 articles from mainstream news outlets released in late March by Northeastern University's School of Journalism.Not just Warren: It's possible that Warren, and Sens.Amy.Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) have been dealing with scandals at a higher rate than their male counterparts ...but another possibility is that women are simply facing more scrutiny than the men," per Northeastern.It's possible that Warren, and Sens.Amy.Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), and Kirsten

Northeastern.Uphill climb: The coverage of Warren has not been as positive and positive horserace coverage tends to produce better numbers for the horserace, Matt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State University, tells Power Up.The coverage of Warren has not been as positive and positive horserace coverage tends to produce better numbers for the horserace, Matt Grossmann, a political

Grossman said.And Warren hasn't had that kind of coverage its been disappointing.The hilarious instance is where Mayor Pete got like 5 percent in one poll and the headline was that he 'doubles his support," Grossman said.And Warren hasn't had that kind of coverage its been disappointing.A Democratic operative puts it this way: She's been generating big ideas, churning out new policy and leading the field intellectually, so it's hard not to read the media's temporary obsession with Pete Buttigieg the intellectual as sexist, just because he speaks Norwegian or whatever.A Democratic operative outlines another problematic paradox for Warren at this point in the race: You need a ton of money to break out or you need the media to decide that you are the flavor of the month or the day and then the money comes, the operative told us.Warren's problem is that she has two strikes against here: she's already been the flavor of the day and she's not raising enough money.Lots of people running think they can win but then the media judges them by how viable they are a year out and kneecaps them.Back to policy: Warren's time spent in the policy weeds may not be as likely to pay off as Mason and Grossman both argue votes just don't care as much about the difference between her proposals and Sanders's single-payer health plan or O'Rourke's support for Medicaid for America.In fact, both experts pointed to studies that show many voters don't actually even know the difference between a conservative and a liberal policy.This nullifies some of the purity tests that have emerged thus far in the Democratic primary.This is something that Trump took advantage of," said Mason.Why this matters: Our assumption that people will divide based on ideological and policy preferences is unclear," Grossmann told us.When it comes to the current field, he says: They're all Democrats so they are all relatively popular with Democrats."Migrants from Cuba, Venezuela and Central America queue at the

Rod Rosenstein stuck his neck out for Trump. Now he’s doing it again for William Barr.:::::Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein is a short-timer at the Justice Department.And in one of his final acts along with seeing the Mueller report through to its conclusion hes vouching for a superior on controversial decisions in the Russia investigation.What could go wrong?Rosenstein on Thursday granted a rare interview to the Wall Street Journal, the purpose of which was clearly to express confidence in embattled Attorney General William P. Barr, who has been criticized for his letter summarizing key parts of the Mueller report and more recently for saying at a Senate hearing Wednesday that the FBI spied on the Trump campaign in 2016.Special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs team has suggested Barrs letter was misleading and left out key information, while spying is a talking point that is favored by President Trump but decidedly not by Barrs law enforcement colleagues.The narrative is building that Barr might be in the tank for Trump.Rosenstein professed to be dumbfounded by that narrative.Hes being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that hes trying to mislead people I think is just completely bizarre, Rosenstein said.He added: It would be one thing if you put out a letter and said, Im not going to give you the report.'What he said is, Look, its going to take a while to process the report.In the meantime, people really want to know whats in it.Im going to give you the top-line conclusions.Thats all he was trying to do.Rosensteins comments are notable because hes one of the few figures involved in the Russia investigation with some bipartisan credibility.He is a Trump appointee as the Justice Departments No.2, but he also has drawn Trumps ire as the overseer of the Mueller probe, which Trump has long argued is a hoax and a witch hunt.Rosenstein, in his few public comments, has taken on critics of the investigation and generally given Mueller broad berth.To some degree, Rosenstein was already invested in Barrs stewardship of the closing stages of the Mueller probe.He praised Barrs nomination, despite Barrs known history of criticizing the Mueller probe, and in that letter he joined with Barr in their controversial decision to exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice even as Mueller declined to either charge or exonerate him.But those things might have been expected of Rosenstein, given his role in the Justice Department and the Mueller probe.Granting the interview, on the other hand, is an especially strong statement that he didnt necessarily have to make at such a crucial juncture.And Rosenstein hasnt always had the best luck with such decisions.At the other bookend of the special counsels investigation was Rosensteins decision to author a letter criticizing then-FBI Director James B. Comey that Trump used to justify his firing.Shortly after this, Trump admitted he was going to fire Comey regardless of Rosensteins thoughts and that he did so with the Russia probe on his mind.Reporting indicates Rosenstein felt used by Trump and that the episode had damaged his reputation.Via the New York Times: In public, Mr. Rosenstein has shown no hint that he had second thoughts about his role writing a memo about Mr. Comeys performance that the White House used to justify firing him.I wrote it.I believe it.I stand by it, Mr. Rosenstein said to Congress last year.But in meetings with law enforcement officials in the chaotic days immediately after Mr. Comeys dismissal, and in subsequent conversations with colleagues and friends, Mr. Rosenstein appeared conflicted, according to the four people.He alternately defended his involvement, expressed remorse at the tumult it unleashed, said the White House had manipulated him, fumed how the news media had portrayed the events and said the full story would vindicate him, said the people, who in recent weeks described the previously undisclosed episodes.In his Wall Street Journal interview, Rosenstein reiterated that he believed in the content of the memo and had few overall regrets about his time as a public official, as it nears an end.If you put something in writing, put your name on it and be prepared to stand behind it, he said.Thats been a theme of my career.Standing by your words, though, is only part of the equation.Vouching for the good faith of an individual who is embarking on a very fraught set of circumstances and whose actions are under fire is quite another.Rosenstein has now thrown in his lot with Barr, and hell find out whether that loyalty will be rewarded or wont ... again.
Inside the Russian effort to target Sanders supporters — and help elect Trump:::::Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spar in February 2016 during a Democratic presidential primary debate hosted by MSNBC at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, N.H. (David Goldman/AP) After Bernie Sanders lost his primary campaign for president against Hillary Clinton in 2016, a Twitter account called Red Louisiana News reached out to his supporters to help sway the general election.Conscious Bernie Sanders supporters already moving towards the best candidate Trump!#Feel the Bern #Vote Trump 2016, the account tweeted.The tweet was not actually from Louisiana, according to an analysis by Clemson University researchers.Instead, it was one of thousands of accounts identified as based in Russia, part of a cloaked effort to persuade supporters of the Vermont senator to elect Trump.Bernie Sanders says his message resonates with Republicans, said another Russian tweet.While much attention has focused on the question of whether the Trump campaign encouraged or conspired with Russia, the effort to target Sanders supporters has been a lesser-noted part of the story.Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, in a case filed last year against 13 Russians accused of interfering in the U.S. presidential campaign, said workers at a St. Petersburg facility called the Internet Research Agency were instructed to write social media posts in opposition to Clinton but to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.That strategy could receive new attention with the release of Muellers report, expected within days.Sanders told Vermont Public Radio last year that one of his campaign workers figured out what was going on, alerted the Clinton campaign and told them, I think these guys are Russians.But Sanders said he never knew, and he later backed off his suggestion that his staff did.A spokesman referred questions to 2016 campaign manager Jeff Weaver, who said in an interview that Sanders misspoke a little bit and conflated a few of the facts....He did not know, I did not know, none of us knew that Russia was behind the efforts.Only recently, with the latest analysis of Twitter data, has the extent of the Russian disinformation campaign been documented on that social media platform.A pair of Clemson University researchers, at the request of The Washington Post, examined English-language tweets identified as coming from Russia, many of which were designed to influence the election.It is impossible to say how many were targeted at Sanders supporters because many dont include his name.Some 9,000 of the Russian tweets used the word Bernie, which were liked 59,281 times and retweeted 61,804 times.But that was only one element of the Russian effort to target Sanders supporters, the researchers said.Many thousands of other tweets, with no direct reference to Sanders, were also designed to appeal to his backers, urging them to do anything but vote for Clinton in the general election.I think there is no question that Sanders was central to their strategy.He was clearly used as a mechanism to decrease voter turnout for Hillary Clinton, said one of the Clemson researchers, Darren Linvill, associate professor of communications.The tweets examined in the new analysis give us a much clearer understanding of the tactics they were using.It was certainly a higher volume than people thought.[Trump disavows past enthusiasm for WikiLeaks after Assanges arrest] The Russian social-media strategy underscores a challenge that Sanders faces as he once again seeks the Democratic presidential nomination, this time in a crowded field.Many Sanders supporters believe he was treated unfairly by the Democratic Party and Clinton, a point the Russians sought to capitalize on as they worked to undermine Clinton in the November election.Although Sanders later denounced the Kremlins efforts and campaigned for Clinton, some Democrats believe he could have done more to smooth over tensions and encourage his supporters to support his onetime opponent.A former senior Clinton campaign official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to avoid publicly criticizing Sanders ahead of the 2020 primaries, said that there remains bitterness over the way Sanders repeatedly said the system was tilted against him.Sanders said in May 2016 that party rules enabling Clinton to collect superdelegates did not meet the definition of rigged, but he called it a dumb process which certainly has disadvantaged our campaign.The effort to promote Sanders as a way to influence the U.S. election began shortly after he declared his candidacy in spring 2015, according to Muellers indictment of the Russians.Russias aim was to defeat or weaken Clinton, who had angered Russian President Vladimir Putin when she had been secretary of state.One reason that Sanders was on Russias radar has been little noted: he, like Trump, opposed trade deals such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Russian President Vladimir Putin had been critical of the TPP, saying it was secretive and hardly facilitates sustainable development of Asia Pacific.During the primaries, Sanders gave at least three interviews to a Russia-controlled television network, RT, in which his trade stance was highlighted.The network in February 2016 criticized MSNBC for breaking away from Sanders after he said he was helping to lead the opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The network posted a story headlined, Bernie Sanders 'censored' by MSNBC while criticizing trade deal.Around the same time that Sanders was featured on RT, Russian employees at the Internet Research Agency were given a document explaining how to influence the U.S. election.The workers were told to use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump we support them), according to Muellers indictment of the Russians.The Twitter database shows the impact.The tweets sent from Russia, cloaked to look as though they came from Americans, included: Bernie Sanders looks to black voters to boost his underdog campaign; Hillary Clintons summer of drama creates openings for Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden; and Im for Bernie all the way!Then, in July 2016, WikiLeaks released emails from the Democratic National Committee that suggested the party machinery was tilted against Sanders.The DNC computers were later revealed to have been hacked by Russia.The hack prompted Trump to stoke the divide among Democrats.Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders, Trump tweeted July 23, 2016. ...On-line from Wikileakes [sic], really vicious.RIGGED!Russian trolls significantly increased their effort to persuade Sanders supporters to oppose Clinton in the general election.One of their methods was to try to convince African Americans that they couldnt trust her.#BlackMenForBernie Leader Switches to Trump!I will Never Vote for Hillary,Welcome aboard the Trump Train, said a tweet from an account that was said to come from Texas and was identified as Southern.Conservative Pro God.Anti Racism.The account, actually operated by a Russian, had 72,121 followers.The message was liked 260 times and retweeted 295 times, according to the Clemson database.Linvill, the Clemson researcher, said Sanders was seen as just a tool to the Russians.He is a wedge to drive into the Democratic Party, resulting in lower turnout for Clinton, he said.The tweets suggested either voting for Trump or a third-party candidate such as Green Party nominee Jill Stein, or writing in Sanderss name.While it is impossible to show a direct correlation between a Russian-based tweet and someones vote in the United States, a post-election survey conducted for Ohio State University documented how false stories spread on social media may have caused a decline in turnout for Clinton.Only 77 percent of those surveyed who had voted for Barack Obama in 2012 supported Clinton in 2016; 10 percent backed Trump, 4 percent voted for third-party candidates, and 8 percent did not vote, according to the YouGov survey.[Bernie Sanders unveils new Medicare-for-all legislation] In an effort to demonstrate how inaccurate information makes its way into the mainstream, the survey asked respondents about three demonstrably false articles that had been widely distributed.A quarter of respondents believed the false story that Clinton was in very poor health, 10 percent believed that Trump had been endorsed by the Pope, and 35 percent (including 20 percent of Obama supporters) believed that Clinton had approved weapons sales to Islamic jihadists, including ISIS.The Ohio State team concluded in a soon-to-be published final version of its report that belief in these fake news stories is very strongly linked to defection from the Democratic ticket by 2012 Obama voters.Obama voters who recognized all three stories as false voted for Clinton at a rate of 89 percent, while 61 percent who believed one of the stories was false voted for her, and 17 percent of those who believed two of the false stories supported Clinton.Yoel Roth, Twitters head of site integrity, said Twitter had studied what happened during the presidential election and will apply those lessons as the 2020 campaign unfolds.Protecting the integrity of public conversation around elections is core to Twitter's mission, Roth said in a statement to The Post.Since 2016, we've launched new policies, significantly scaled our enforcement against malicious automation, built strong partnerships within the industry and with government entities, and opened the largest public archive of potential information operations online, including thousands of Russian-linked accounts we have removed.Sanders told Vermont Public Radio last year that the Russians were playing a really disgusting role because they dont believe in anything.And all they want to do is sow division in this country, bring people against each other.So what they were saying is in so many words is Bernie Sanders is not going to win, so if you are a Bernie Sanders supporter, let me tell you, Hillary Clinton is a criminal, a murderer, a terrible person ...crazy, all of these disgusting things.Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said the Russians will strike again.As a result, he said, it is imperative for everyone else, especially Democratic candidates, to work together and support each other to defend against these threats.Craig Timberg contributed to this report.
Powell maintains his distance from Trump in speech to House Democrats:::::Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell gently asserted his independence from President Trump in a private meeting with House Democrats on Thursday night, declaring that political identification and pressures have little bearing on his decisions as head of the nations fiscal overseer, according to multiple people in the room.Speaking at the House Democratic Caucus retreat, Powell told Democrats about how he viewed his role as Fed leader as apolitical in overseeing the nations economy.Politics, he said, dont influence his decisions on when to raise interest rates.Were strictly nonpartisan, Powell said.We check our political identification at the door.Powells comments come amid attacks on him by Trump, who nominated him to his current position.Trump has blasted Powell for raising interest rates four times last year, suggesting those moves have jeopardized economic gains that have boomed on his watch.Last year, Trump floated the idea of firing Powell, two people familiar with the exchanges told The Washington Post.While he shied away from policy questions almost the entire evening, Powell said it would be unthinkable that the United States would default on its debt ceiling payments a comment some took as a warning not to play chicken with the nations credit.Powell also noted that no other country has a debt limit they simply appropriate money echoing an argument often made by lawmakers who want to eliminate the U.S. debt ceiling, including many Democrats.Those comments come just months before the Treasury Department is expected to run out of money to pay creditors, a deadline that will require Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to put together a bipartisan agreement to avert a default that could result in downgrading the countrys credit rating.Those negotiations have yet to take off.But Trump in the past has heeded the advice of hard-liners in his partys right flank, including agreeing to shut down the government for 35 days last December.Many of those same hard-liners have championed debt ceiling standoffs before.Democratic leaders applauded Powell on Thursday night for his assertion of independence, even though he dodged their questions about Trump.Powell has made it unambiguously clear that he views his role, rightfully, as nonpartisan, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.)said in his remarks introducing Powell.Since his confirmation on a bipartisan 84-13 vote in January 2018, Chairman Powell has made ensuring the independence of the Federal Reserve a centerpiece of his leadership.That is a view we share.He added: From time to time in its 103 years, the Federal Reserve has stood up to challenges to its independence from political considerations and the influence of either the President or Congress.Thats a good thing, and its a fundamental principle that both the President and Congress ought to uphold for the sake of economic stability.Some Democrats tried to lecture Powell, according to people in the room.Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio), who leads the House Financial Services subcommittee on oversight and investigations and moderated the conversation, cut off lawmakers trying to filibuster.One, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.), complained about the size of the Feds balance sheet, suggesting the institution needed to unload assets it took on during the 2008 financial crisis.Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) asked Powell about the earned income tax credit for low-income earners, as well as minimum wage, a question that comes as House Democrats are trying to pass legislation increasing the minimum wage to $15.Powell responded that the EITC worked to create widely shared economic prosperity, but mostly he didnt comment on fiscal policy, saying in his opening remarks that its really not our job.We are highly transparent in what were doing and why were doing it.We have an obligation to explain that, he said.Powell also would not comment on Trumps decision to nominate failed 2012 presidential hopeful Herman Cain and conservative economist Stephen Moore to join him on the Federal Reserve.Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) asked about the president appointing two spectacularly unqualified candidates and whether they would be controlled by the president.Powell responded, I dont comment on nominees.We wait for the nomination process to work, he said .At the end of the evening, Pelosi thanked Powell for staying independent from Trumps political pressure and even choosing not to answer certain questions by her own members.When she inquired after his own global views of the Federal Reserve and the American economy, he replied that the United States needs to maintain its leadership, a comment some in the room saw as a rebuke of Trumps increasingly isolated approach to foreign policy.American leadership is the gold standard for the postwar period, Powell said.We designed the post-World War II architecture of democracy and must continue in that position.
Four Senate Republicans signal opposition to Trump’s plan to put Herman Cain on Federal Reserve Board, all but sinking nomination:::::President Trumps nomination of former presidential candidate Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve Board has been controversial even among Republican lawmakers.(Molly Riley/AP/2014 photo) A swift defection of at least four Senate Republicans has all but doomed Herman Cains chances of winning a seat on the Federal Reserves board of governors, a striking rebuke to President Trump in his drive to remake the powerful U.S. central bank.A strong ally of the president, Sen. Kevin Cramer (N.D.), on Thursday joined three other Republicans Sens.Mitt Romney (Utah), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Cory Gardner (Colo.) in announcing opposition to Cains appointment to the Fed.Republicans control 53 votes in the 100-seat Senate, and losing the support of four members means Cain would need help from Democrats, which appears unlikely.If I had to vote today, I would vote no, said Cramer, a member of the Senate Banking Committee that would consider any nomination.As word of the Senate backlash moved through the White House late Thursday, the long odds of confirmation became clear, according to two people briefed on the talks.It also became increasingly likely that Cain would not be formally nominated by Trump after all because the Senate support never materialized.The rapid rejection of Cain a 2012 GOP presidential candidate pauses Trumps effort to remold the central bank into a more political body with outspoken individuals who share his views.It also reflects a growing unease among Senate Republicans with the way Trump has tried to bend the institution to his will in the past six months.Trump has jawboned Fed officials and pushed them to slash interest rates and flood the economy with cheap money, even though during his presidential campaign he accused the central bank of creating a big, fat, ugly bubble.And furious with some of the Fed officials his advisers pushed on him last year, Trump has completely taken over the process, seeking to elevate two controversial cable news pundits who have loyally supported much of his agenda.In addition to Cain, Trump has said he wanted to nominate conservative economist Stephen Moore to the Fed.The Fed is the government agency that sets interest rates and regulates financial companies.It plays a major role in setting the direction of the economy, and Trump has blamed Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell for raising interest rates last year in a way that the White House alleges damaged the economy.The economy grew 2.9 percent last year, but Trump has said it would have grown 4 percent if the Fed hadnt acted.Current and former Fed officials have watched the criticism closely, aware that Trump is apt to attack someone he doesnt like and then move on to something else.But the assault against the Fed persisted, and the efforts to install Cain and Moore sparked even more concern.I worry that a perception that somehow politics is gaining a more important role in these decisions will undermine confidence in this nonpartisan institution, said Donald Kohn, a former Fed vice chair who spent more than 30 years at the central bank.I think thats a risk.View Graphic Tracking how many key positions Trump has filled so far Trump has not formally nominated Cain or Moore.The White House had no comment Thursday about the growing opposition to Cain among Senate Republicans, or whether the administration plans to formally submit his nomination to the Senate.Trumps efforts to pressure the Fed come at a time when the central bank is trying to gauge how best to handle a complicated economy.Unemployment is low and economic growth has picked up in the past year, but there are signs that the global economy is slowing down in a way that could affect U.S. businesses and consumers.White House officials in the past 25 years have largely avoided direct attacks against the Fed, worried about eroding its independence.But Trump tossed that precedent aside last year when he launched repeated blasts against the central bank, with Powell in the crosshairs.He even asked advisers whether he had the power to remove Powell.When he realized he didnt, he decided to try to stack the Feds other board seats with outspoken political figures who would challenge the central banks leadership.Republicans were cautiously supportive of Moore at first, but Cains ascent drew alarm.Cain was well known during his presidential campaign for a bumper-sticker tax plan that he called 9-9-9, but he has been forced to deny multiple accusations of sexual misconduct and harassment.Ive recommended Herman Cain.Hes a very terrific man, a terrific person.Hes a friend of mine, Trump said last week.I have recommended him highly for the Fed.Ive told my folks thats the man.National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Thursday morning that the FBI was conducting a background check on Cain and that he was still the White Houses pick at the moment.Moore, in an interview, predicted Cain would have eventually been confirmed by the Senate once lawmakers spent more time getting to know him.I think having someone with business experience on the Fed would be a real breath of fresh air, Moore said.Cain once ran Godfathers Pizza and served as chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in the 1990s.Moore, asked about the criticisms leveled against Cain and himself for being political, said Im a policy guy and hes a businessman, and I think most Americans like the idea of putting non-PhD economists, non-academics into the Fed.I think thats an asset.I think thats going to be part of the [2020] campaign, that Trump thinks outside the box.Still, the swift backlash to Trumps Fed picks has worried some White House officials, concerned that Trump was picking unnecessary fights.Trump was undeterred, though, and has been enamored with Cain for months.Trump recently gathered with generals and other military leaders for a meeting about the Mexican border, according to two people familiar with the chain of events who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely describe the discussions.At the meeting, which was held in the White House Situation Room, an aide passed Trump a note informing him that Cain was in the building.Trump summoned Cain to the meeting, and then told the military brass that they needed to come up with a 9-9-9 plan for the border.The joke fell flat.Senate Republicans have largely been deferential to most of Trumps nominations throughout the government, and on Thursday they even won some support from Democrats when they confirmed David Bernhardt to be interior secretary.But their slim control of the chamber makes it nearly impossible to confirm someone who Republicans cant rally around.I dont think Herman Cain would be confirmed by the Senate, and I think the president would be wise to find someone who is less partisan and more experienced in the world of economics, Romney, whom Cain ran against for the 2012 nomination, said this week.I would anticipate voting no.Murkowski said she had earlier expressed concerns about Cain that had not diminished.Asked to elaborate, Murkowski responded: Im just not a fan.Cain did not return a request for comment Thursday.In remarks Wednesday night in Kansas, Cain called his Senate critics a bunch of yahoos and said he would not be deterred by criticism, according to the Kansas City Star.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has privately encouraged his members to take their concerns about problematic nominees directly to the White House, declined on Thursday to say whether Trump should refrain from nominating Cain altogether.But he stressed that the White House needs to consider two factors in its nominations: the individuals background check, as well as his or her prospects of getting confirmed in the Senate.Several of our members have had strong feelings about people whove been mentioned in newspaper articles, McConnell said in a pen-and-pad briefing with reporters.I think that should be helpful to the administration, actually.When asked whether he was surprised by Trumps consideration of Cain for the Fed, McConnell responded: Surprised?On a daily basis.A number of presidents have appointed campaign advisers or administration officials to the Feds board of governors, but there isnt recent precedent for someone as politically adversarial as Cain.Cain started the political action committee, America Fighting Back, last year to help Trump in the midterm elections, has called for reverting to the gold standard, and wants the central bank to slash interest rates.Recently, America Fighting Back criticized the 12 GOP senators who voted to reject the presidents national emergency declaration to begin border wall construction.The organization recently sent out a fundraising email dubbing those dozen Republicans as traitors, according to the liberal media watchdog group Media Matters.One GOP senator, speaking

Brexit: Philip Hammond defends spending billons on no-deal preparations:::::The chancellor is in Washington DC for meetings at the International Monetary Fund The chancellor has defended spending billions of pounds preparing for a no-deal Brexit.Philip Hammond made his case after Sky News revealed the government was mothballing the team of civil servants responsible for no-deal planning.Over the past two years, the government had moved thousands of civil servants away from their normal jobs to prepare for the possibility that the UK would leave the European Union without a deal.Mr Hammond told Sky News: "It would have been irresponsible not to prepare for no deal, so long as it was a real possible outcome."Making preparations for events that we hope will not happen is an everyday part of government.Advertisement "Just to be clear about this - we spent 4bn so far on preparing for Brexit, but that is not just for a no-deal Brexit - much of that money would need to be spent anyway, putting in place systems to replace EU systems that we've been using up to now."'Do not waste this time' Sky News understands the civil servants will be gradually returned to their home departments after the Easter break but those working on no-deal contingencies were told to leave their work in good order should it need to be resumed.Mr Hammond was speaking in Washington DC where he is attending meetings at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).His words came after the UK was given until 31 October to leave the European Union, a deadline that had previously been tonight.Brexit special: Are voters impatient or indifferent?But Mr Hammond refused to rule out the possibility that the UK will face the same risk of leaving without a deal when the October deadline arrives.He said: "Unfortunately parliament's clarity on that issue has not been matched by clarity about what kind of deal we should have in order to ensure that we don't have no deal."What we've got to do now, through the discussions we are having with the Labour Party, is find a way forward that allows us to find a deal that works for Britain, allows us to deliver Brexit, and allows us to protect the economy and British jobs."Brexit date delayed until Halloween Yesterday the IMF's managing director Christine Lagarde said the the delay to Brexit had helped avoid a "terrible outcome" that would have snowballed across an already fragile global economy.Ms Lagarde told a news conference: "It gives time for continued discussions between the various parties involved in the UK."
Brexit Party: Nigel Farage claims electorate 'betrayed' as he launches new party:::::Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of the newly-created 'Brexit Party' Nigel Farage has said he wants to shake up the British political system as he launched his Brexit Party in time to stand in the European elections.The former UKIP leader announced the first candidates of the newly-formed Brexit Party at a launch event in Coventry, revealing its new chairman was businessman and entrepreneur Richard Tice.In a surprise standing, Annunziata Rees-Mogg, journalist and sister of Conservative backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg announced she would be a candidate for Mr Farage's party.Image: Annunziata Rees-Mogg is a former Conservative candidate herself Mr Farage said: "All over the world, people look on with incredulity because they still think that we are a great country."And the funny thing is that we, the people, still think that we are a great country.Advertisement "But our leaders are happy to continue down the path of managed decline."I genuinely believe right now, this nation, we are lions led by donkeys."Not only are our leaders weak, not only have they wilfully betrayed this result, but they are also pretty much incompetent."They are not actually very good at what they do, they are not very good at anything."Image: Mr Farage said the British people were 'lions led by donkeys' He said there were too many "classic career politicians" who he said would "embrace the European project" because it provided a "safety net for anyone who fails in national politics".Mr Farage has stood in seven UK national elections and lost every time.He has been a member of the European Parliament since 1999.Addressing party finances, Mr Farage said the new website had already brought in 750,000 in 10 days in small donations from members of the public.He said he would welcome big donors, but thought it would be more exciting if hundreds of thousands of small donors funded the "rebirth of democracy".Image: The Brexit Party will 'do things differently', according to Mr Tice The leader announced several candidates, including Ms Rees-Mogg, the sister of the ERG chairman and a former Conservative candidate herself, and Richard Tice, a businessman who will be the party's new chairman.Ms Rees-Mogg said: "I joined the Conservative Party in 1984 and this is not a decision I have made lightly - to leave a party for which I have fought at every election since 1987, from Maggie Thatcher through to Theresa May."I know which one I'd rather have representing us now."She added: "We've got to rescue our democracy."Mr Tice said: "We know this country deserves so much better.That is why the Brexit Party is going to do things differently."If we carry on under this leadership we will be here on Halloween night writing another begging letter.It must stop."There's a huge movement ladies and gentlemen.This is a time to change politics for good."The campaign launch comes on the day the UK had been set to leave the EU without a deal, but for a last minute second extension to the Article 50 date which was granted by leaders this week.Rees-Mogg's sister to stand for Brexit Party It means the UK will have to hold the European Parliament elections, which has sparked outrage among many in the Conservative Party.There is speculation the votes could be split among more parties this year, although estimates of turnout vary from very high to very low.The turnout at the last European Parliament elections was about 36%.Reaction came from Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who tweeted: "You preach fear, hatred and division, Nigel.But the vast majority of the British people are crying out for a politics of hope, respect and community."We will face you down, and we will defeat you.Bring it."The new party has already faced controversy.Its first leader quit after Islamophobic tweets were uncovered, a matter Mr Farage referred to as "teething problems".He also said the party would be "intolerant of intolerance", saying he would make it different in terms of "personnel" to his last party, UKIP.Image: Nigel Farage has been a member of the European Parliament since 1999 In its current form, UKIP has admitted members from the EDL and the BNP, something Mr Farage has been very critical of.The Brexit Party has also already been targeted by anti-Brexit campaigners.Activists Led By Donkeys bought the registration for TheBrexitParty.com and put a message on it reading: "Nigel Farage Doesn't Represent Britain."Nigel Farage wants to register a huge victory in the European elections, but he can't even register his own website."Seven times he's failed to get elected to Westminster.But he did get himself a seat in the European Parliament because at the time hardly any of us cared.Well we do now."Nobody is more responsible than Farage for the diminished state of our nation."Now he's seeking to exploit the turmoil he himself created to get re-elected to Brussels on the 23rd May - Register to vote by May 7th to stop him."
No-deal Brexit planning winds down with 'immediate effect' - Sky sources:::::Around 4bn has been spent on no-deal Brexit planning Operational planning for a no-deal Brexit is being wound down by the government "with immediate effect", according to Sky sources.In an email obtained by Sky News, the permanent secretary of a frontline Brexit department thanked staff for their work in preparing for a no-deal divorce from the EU.But they added that "in common with the rest of government, we have stood down our no-deal operational planning with immediate effect".The letter goes on to say: "[On Thursday] morning, at a meeting chaired by the cabinet secretary, we agreed that the objective is to ensure we wind down our no-deal planning in a careful, considered and orderly way."That implies that the winding down of no-deal planning is taking place across government and is being co-ordinated from the highest levels.Advertisement Image: Theresa May has refused to take the UK out of the EU without a deal Over the past two years, the government has spent 2bn on Brexit preparations and redeployed thousands of civil servants away from their normal jobs to work in no-deal related work.It allocated a total of 4.2bn to plan for "Brexit preparations", dealing with all scenarios, not just no-deal.Some of this work includes post-Brexit matters which will exist whether there is a deal or not, like customs changes and EU settled status.Sky News understands these civil servants will be gradually returned to their home departments after the Easter break.Staff working on no-deal contingencies have been instructed to leave their work in good order should it need to be resumed.This revelation goes against the grain of comments from government ministers, including the Conservative Party's deputy chairman James Cleverley.Hours earlier, he had tweeted: "I'm going to keep working on our no-deal preparations in case we have to leave without one."Image: The wind down will be done in a 'careful, considered and orderly way' A government spokesperson said: "As a responsible government, we've been preparing for over two years to minimise any disruption in the event of no deal."In light of this week's developments, departments will make sensible decisions about the timing and pace at which some of this work is progressing given that the date we leave the EU has changed, but we will absolutely continue to make all necessary preparations."Political reaction from Brexiteers who wanted the government to use the Article 50 extension to October to step up no-deal preparations has been furious.Of course, no deal never happening would have probably always been the case.But in the meantime the govt has spent 2bn on preparation which will never be needed on a bluff no-one believed, mainly just to please a few dozen Tory backbenchers.Thats about 60 per taxpayer.Lewis Goodall (@lewis_goodall) April 11, 2019 Steve Baker, the eurosceptic deputy chairman of the European Research Group of Tory MPs, tweeted: "Sheer spite, I regret to say.Very sad.Officials have worked exceptionally hard to deliver our preparedness and deserve better."Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary, described the move as "beyond stupid".And Crispin Blunt, the senior Tory backbencher, even said the matter might even provoke him to vote against the government in a no confidence vote.The shelving of emergency planning for a no-deal Brexit includes the dismantling of Operation Brock on the M20 in Kent to deal with potential lorry tailbacks from Dover caused by new customs checks.That decision was taken on Thursday at a meeting chaired by Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill, according to an email seen by Sky News.Image: A government spokesperson said it had been working to 'minimise disruption' The message - said to have been sent to all civil servants in an unnamed "front line Brexit department" - said the suspension was taking place with "immediate effect".It comes after Theresa May granted MPs two weeks of Easter recess, telling them to "reflect on the issues" in the hope they come back and pass a Brexit deal.The prime minister told the Commons it had a "national duty" to pass a withdrawal agreement.She promised that parallel compromise talks with Labour would be pursued in a "constructive and positive fashion" as officials from both parties continued their negotiations in Westminster.Downing Street also hinted a Brexit deal could be put to vote imminently after MPs return to Westminster on 23 April.Asked if Mrs May was preparing to bring back a meaningful vote on a Brexit deal soon, her spokesman told journalists at a briefing: "I think that's a good way of describing our intentions."Image: Parliament is in recess until 23 April.Pic: UK Parliament/Mark Duffy Meanwhile Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP, headed to Brussels to pledge that its opposition to the withdrawal agreement "won't diminish".As recess begins, the clock continues to tick down to European Parliament elections being held one month later.Contingency plans have already been implemented for Britons to re-elect over 70 MEPs to the chamber in Strasbourg.The Conservative Party has also declared it will field candidates in the election.
With Brexit delayed until October, MPs cheer as they get Easter break:::::With Brexit delayed until October, MPs cheer as they get Easter break With Brexit delayed until October, MPs cheer as they get Easter break Compromise talks will continue between the government and Labour Theresa May has confirmed she plans to call another vote on her Brexit deal "soon" - but MPs have been granted an Easter recess so they can take time to "reflect on the issues".Returning from Brussels after EU leaders agreed to delay Brexit until 31 October, the prime minister was welcomed by some in parliament but faced wrath from others.Tusk: 'Do not waste this time' Mrs May told MPs they had a "national duty" to pass a divorce deal as soon as possible - holding out hope that Brexit could happen before 22 May so the UK can avoid participating in the European parliamentary elections.She promised that parallel compromise talks with Labour would be pursued in a "constructive and positive fashion" as officials from both parties continued their negotiations in Westminster.Jeremy Corbyn responded by calling for "all options to remain on the table".Advertisement PM: We need to leave EU as soon as possible Labour MPs also lined up to criticise the prime minister for refusing to reveal what "red lines" she would drop to secure their support.Meanwhile Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP, headed to Brussels to pledge that its opposition to the withdrawal agreement "won't diminish".And Tory Brexiteers repeatedly slammed Mrs May for refusing to pursue a no-deal Brexit.Mark Francois accused the prime minister of "sheer obstinacy", while Sir Bill Cash called on her to resign.Image: Theresa May told MPs they had a 'national duty' to pass a Brexit deal According to Sky sources, Whitehall has stood down its operational planning for a no-deal Brexit.With the pressure of an imminent Brexit lifted, MPs were given the remaining two weeks of their Easter break from parliament - prompting cheers to erupt in the House of Commons.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom confirmed MPs would rise at the close of business on Thursday and return on 23 April, subject to a motion being approved.In a briefing with journalists, Mrs May's spokesman said: "Fundamentally probably people could use a break and I'm sure you would all agree with that."Image: MPs have been granted two weeks' break.Pic: UK Parliament/Mark Duffy The spokesman was also asked if the prime minister was preparing to bring back a meaningful vote on a Brexit deal soon."I think that's a good way of describing our intentions," he said.As the recess begins, the clock continues to tick down to European Parliament elections being held one month later.Image: Arlene Foster sent a message to Brussels her opposition 'won't diminish' Downing Street admitted talks with Labour would not continue "for sake of it" and stressed an "urgency" to avoid participating in the European elections.However, contingency plans have been implemented for Britons to re-elect over 70 MEPs to the chamber in Strasbourg.The Conservative Party has also declared it will field candidates in the election.Britain is now due to leave the EU in over six months' time, with the leaders of all 28 countries due to meet in June to take stock of the Brexit process.If Mrs May manages to get her divorce deal ratified by parliament before then, Brexit could happen earlier.She has lost votes on it three times - the first marking the largest Commons defeat suffered by a prime minister in history.
Faisal Islam: My front row seat in a rollercoaster of mutating political crises:::::It's been a half decade of politics that no one could have predicted.I have had a front row seat, sometimes a backstage access all areas pass too.Park for a minute the extraordinary rollercoaster of connected, mutating crises: the post-referendum SNP surge that did for Labour, led to both Jeremy Corbyn and a majority Tory government that in turn led to the EU referendum, and then Brexit, and then a minority Tory government that in turn there were not enough votes in parliament for an actual Brexit plan.The currents were there from the beginning - a breakdown in trust in conventional political parties, scepticism about the media, social media creating silo-ised and atomised audiences speaking to themselves.Politics became driven less by managerial competence and more by belief and betrayal.All of this occurred in the context of the second half decade after the financial crisis.Incomes squeezed, insecure work, and then the public sector cuts designed to balance the government's books.Advertisement It was a potent brew.Into this mix throw two referenda and two general elections and almost constant crisis fever pitch.The essential ingredients of what was to come were all there in my first few months.Image: Faisal revealed the possibility of a 45bn Brexit divorce bill, which was denied at the time I interviewed then mayor of London Boris Johnson at his EU policy launch, on his decision to return to the Commons, and incredibly he went along with my live role play of EU membership re-negotiations with me pretending to be Angela Merkel and him pretending to be the prime minister.Within weeks there were Tory defections to UKIP, by-elections, and a Scottish referendum that saw the impact of new forms of media, scepticism of the establishment, and generational splits.Following the referendum loss with a conscious attempt to win the post referendum politics, I followed Nicola Sturgeon on her remarkable sell out tour, that showed the SNP wave about to shake politics and crush Scottish Labour.That possibility was brilliantly marshalled by the Cameron Conservative campaign of 2015 in a way that Ed Miliband did not properly deal with.Image: Faisal hosted one of the debates around the EU referendum with Kay Burley It helped Cameron win Lib-Dem seats far away from the influence of Ms Sturgeon, and deliver an unlikely and historic Tory majority.Briefly.But it was a small majority.And the Cameron majority government was repeatedly pinned down by rebellion, failed to get its budgets through without major U-turns, and was the subject of detailed eurosceptics plotting over the terms of the Brexit referendum.David Cameron's overconfidence about his ability to win with Project Fear tactics arose from the 2014 and 2015 ballot box wins, but they were to prove his eventual undoing.There will be long books written about Brexit.But with Sky News we were there when Michael Gove told the country we had "enough of experts", when David Cameron was laughed at for scaremongering, and then in the frenzied aftermath when a leading MP openly told me "there is no plan".Image: Sky News was there when Michael Gove said the country had had enough of experts But the Brexit negotiation and the lead up to the triggering of Article 50 were the most extraordinary time, where my basic assessment was that very senior people in and advising government simply did not understand what they were doing strategically.I recall telling a top government adviser during the Tory conference 2016 that the UK was about to get the worst set of global headlines in our history, and that if his boss really wanted a "Global Britain" he had half an hour to meet them all to prevent serious damage to our global image.I carried in my back pocket on the PM's plane an incredible memo from the Japanese government showing its critical fears about the Brexit negotiation, designed to shake things up ahead of Mrs May's G20 summit meeting.In late 2016 I picked up news of a likely long transition period, denied at the time, and a 45bn Brexit divorce bill, also denied at the time.I anticipated that the UK would end up with something like the customs union in my first Sky Views piece, because of manufacturing and Northern Ireland.Image: Faisal interviewed Theresa May in the run up to the 2017 election alongside Jeremy Paxman All were flamed as some sort of combination of fake news or Project Fear - all essentially correctly anticipated the path of the past three years.Particular thanks to the cabinet minister who rang up to tell me our Brexit Forensics series was "venal".Too much has happened to do any justice to it in this piece.But there have been dark moments.Reporting on the Manchester bombing from Downing St and on Jo Cox's murder from the Vote Leave Bus was very difficult.I fear politics has not learnt the lessons it needs to from the latter form of political terrorism.Unnecessarily aggressive personalised attacks on our politicians demean and endanger the entire process.Are some MPs incompetent, stupid, maddening, and disagreeable?Absolutely.But having observed them as closely as anybody for half a decade, honestly every single one - all 650 - are voting the way they are voting, or arguing the way they do, because of their vision of what will make the country a better place.Image: The weaponisation of betrayal politics is becoming 'deeply troubling' They are not treasonous.There are no traitors.Full blooded disagreement and argument is a necessary feature of our politics.The weaponisation of betrayal politics, however, is becoming deeply troubling.There are senior politicians who should stop playing with fire.Lastly though - a thank you to you all, viewers, and readers.I have thrived on all the feedback, some of my best lines of questioning have emerged from you.The lady at the Sturgeon rally who said of the the oil price slump deficit "we will find it within us", the Tory vote in Stockton when we'd been told the town was moving towards Corbyn a week before the election, the Stand Up Be Counted young voters who roasted David Cameron and Ed Miliband far more effectively than most journalists.And Sky News will no doubt continue to serve up ever better political coverage with Beth Rigby, Jon, Tom, Rob, Lewis, Kate, Tamara and soon Sam Coates.Farewell!
'Incompetent, self-interested s****': Fear and loathing on the doorstep over Brexit:::::'Incompetent, self-interested s****': Fear and loathing on the doorstep over Brexit 'Incompetent, self-interested s****': Fear and loathing on the doorstep over Brexit Activists for political parties are hardy souls.They're used to braving the elements, leafleting and door knocking in the depths of midwinter and encountering the uninterested, the unruly and even the odd bloodthirsty dog.But from conversations I've been having with councillors and council candidates from both main parties over the past few days, all campaigning for next month's local elections, the reaction they've received this time round has been of a quite different order.The Tories, most of all, are in abject despair with many believing they are heading for the drubbing of their lives.One, a local chairman from Essex, told me that his prime minister's actions represent "an absolute betrayal of the British people".He told me: "Next month's elections are going to be absolutely pivotal - we are going to get absolutely hammered."We are struggling to get anyone to deliver leaflets, even members of our executive don't want to go out."This theme of Conservatives being unable to turn out their own members was commonplace across the country.One exasperated Tory councillor told me: "Every association I've spoken to are struggling to get their members out."Members are saying, why should I get s*** on the doorstep and doors slammed in my face when I'm as angry as they are?"Image: Theresa May gave speeches to rooms of party campaigners in 2017 Most are unequivocal: they blame Theresa May and want her to go."It isn't just six weeks of incompetence, it's two and a half years."But this isn't just a rejection of the Tory party and Theresa May, the backlash extends to Labour too.I've spoken to a score of Labour councillors from up and down the country who are deeply concerned about the reaction they're getting.One Labour councillor in south Yorkshire told me he'd seen nothing like it."It's horrendous - worse than when people spat at us over Iraq," he said."Canvassing feels pretty tough - mainly people want to tell us we are all corrupt and f****** useless."At the other end of the land, a Labour councillor in Essex said: "This is by far the worst election I've been involved with."It's vitriolic.You knock at a door and the people on the other side scream at you."It'll take a generation to recover.All you hear is 'Labour are stopping Brexit.Corbyn is crap, the Tories are traitors, we are all the same'.People are clear, they won't be voting."Image: Labour activists took to the streets in 2017 in an effort to get Corbyn into number 10 A Tory in north Yorkshire agreed that the Labour leader remained a saving grace in some Tory areas.He said: "Normally I'd think Labour would take control of our district council but speaking to their candidates they're getting it just as bad."If they had a competent leader this would be an extinction level event for the Conservatives.Instead, everyone hates them too."What shines through in these conversations is the current malaise seems to transcend the remainer/leave divide and rather express a deeper dissatisfaction, a rage, a fury with the political class as a whole.Image: A Leave supporter protesting outside the Houses of Parliament Howsoever they voted in the referendum, voters seem to believe that the current crop of politicians have humiliated the nation in the execution of its result.More than one councillor drew comparisons with the expenses crisis (and indeed, said that "was a walk in the park compared to this").One said: "It is fury at the whole of parliament for being incompetent, self-interested s**** not interested in the good of the country.It's getting worse as every week goes by."Image: MPs are being blamed for the problems that party activists face A full blown political crisis of confidence is emerging.In an odd way, it's a profound mutation from the currents which lay underneath the referendum result.Of a fashion, that was a vote of faith in the capability of the British state to manage a crisis and a profound political change, time and again, in 2016, I heard voters say variations of "I'm sure they'll be able to work it out".The last weeks seem to show that they can't.Most worryingly of all, many candidates reflected to me that they worry that this anger may mutate into something rather more sinister.One Labour councillor told me he wouldn't risk standing in the European elections and that he thought the party's candidates might need security.A Tory spoke of the "abuse, threats of violence and hate" his party candidates are receiving on a daily basis.Image: Jo Cox was killed in her constituency after delivering a local surgery Another, deeply depressed with the health of British democracy, sadly opined "I'm convinced that someone is going to get hurt because there's lots of angry nutters who have had way too much internet".Three short years ago an MP was assassinated in cold blood: in the wake of her death, much was written and said to the effect that we needed a kinder, better politics.We feel a long, long way from that.
EU foster children should be given automatic British citizenship, charity says:::::Kelly Newton, pictured with her two foster children, says there is too little focus on the human side of Brexit Thousands of EU children living in foster care in the UK should be given automatic British citizenship to avoid becoming the new Windrush generation, say a leading children's charity.Coram, a legal children's centre specialising in adoption and fostering services, has warned that thousands of children risk being left undocumented when the UK leaves the European Union because they are unaware of the EU settlement scheme or find it too complicated.The government has launched an online settlement application which all EU nationals must complete in order to remain in the UK and be able to work, access healthcare and education.But Coram's childcare lawyer, Alexandra Conroy-Harris, told Sky News that many children in the care system will struggle to provide the evidence they need to remain in the UK.Image: Alexandra Conroy-Harris says EU children should be accepted under the scheme She said: "To get status they would have to prove they were from an EU country, if they don't have the paperwork then they can't, or if they were born in this country they will have to prove that their parents were from an EU country.Advertisement "Again, if a child has been taken into care often we don't know what has happened to their parents.A child would get to age 18 and come out of foster care without much of the paperwork they would need and we can't tell them what will happen to them."There is just a huge gap that these children are going to fall through."To solve this issue, Mrs Conroy-Harris said the children should be granted British citizenship.She said: "If there could be a particular programme to allow children in long-term foster care to have access to British citizenship without having to make a separate application, just an automatic right to have their birth registered, to have a British passport, to have citizenship."It wouldn't be a dramatic number but it would make an enormous difference for a child in care to say 'yes I can stay here when I am 18'."Image: David Simmonds warns legal bills could be huge for those trying to settle EU children It is currently free for EU nationals to apply to the settlement scheme, but the process to apply for British citizenship can cost more than 1,000 per child.The Local Government Association has warned that the final cost may be a lot higher.Deputy chairman of the LGA, David Simmonds, said: "It's well over 1,000 just for the application of a child who is looking to register and in those situations which are complicated, when age is disputed or there's an immigration issue, the legal bills can run into tens of thousands of pounds per individual."Children in care should be treated favourably by the system.We shouldn't see local authority tax payers picking up huge bills for taking children through that application system."The system itself should be slick, simple and inexpensive and provide the individual with a piece of evidence that shows their status."So should they find themselves in a Windrush type situation where their status is questioned 20/30/40 years in the future, they will have the evidence to prove their legal status in this country."Image: Foster children from the EU must enrol in the EU settlement scheme by the time they are 18 There are currently 75,000 children living in care in England, but there is no information on how many will need to make applications under the EU settlement scheme.It has not been a legal obligation for local authorities to record the nationality of children in foster care.The Home Office has estimated there are approximately 5,000 EU children in care in the UK, but the real number is not known.Kelly Newton, from Lewisham in south London, has been a foster carer for 14 years, looking after a total of 28 children.For the last five years she has been looking after 13-year-old twin girls from Denmark after they were removed from their birth parents.She said: "It was only when I went to renew the girls' passports when I realised we needed to apply for EU settlement to ensure they could remain in the UK when they turn 18."There was so much information, pages of documents, I didn't know where to start.It was a big worry for us."Image: Kelly Newton has to travel to Scotland to ensure the twin girls she fosters can enrol Ms Newton had to travel to Scotland with the girls to complete the applications with the help of children's charity, Coram."We needed a letter from the school, one from social services, their passports and a letter from us.It took two hours to fill out the forms and was really stressful," she said."We were lucky to be able to go through channels and find someone who would help.There are lots of children out there that when they reach 18, who knows what will happen to them."She added: "There is not enough attention on the human side of Brexit.The politicians are wrapped up in trade and business, and as a foster carer, I think it's so important these children are looked after and it's not being highlighted enough."Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes said: "It is a priority of mine to ensure that the EU Settlement Scheme is accessible for everyone, including children in care."This is why we are providing grant funding of up to 9m for voluntary and community organisations across the UK to support EU citizens who might need additional help when applying to the scheme."We are also working closely with local authorities and other stakeholders in the UK to ensure that applications to the EU Settlement Scheme are made on behalf of all looked after children who

Why Theresa May fears dropping her Brexit red lines:::::Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are holding talks on a compromise deal It was a blunt message to MPs - and not the first time we have heard it from this prime minister.Put simply: "Vote for something that's on the table and all these delays can end."That was not the only familiar theme.As far as her seemingly doomed agreement goes, Theresa May said she was sticking to the plan she laid out last week.PM: We need to leave EU as soon as possible Talks will continue with Labour to find something both parties can unite behind.If a compromise deal cannot be thrashed out, then MPs will be presented with a range of options - no doubt including the prime minister's beleaguered agreement.Interested parties will spend the intervening time lobbying for this latest extension to be used for another public vote, another Conservative leader, or a further round of negotiations with the EU to try and get rid of the much-hated Irish backstop.It is unlikely we will see any of those materialise in the immediate future - or at least until Theresa May has had another heave at getting her deal over the line.Tusk: 'Do not waste this time' Brexiteer nerves will not be settled by Jeremy Corbyn's welcoming of "indications" from the government that they may compromise in "key areas".That will be read as code for caving in on a customs union, something that is fiercely opposed by many on the front and backbenches of the Tory party.The prime minister spoke of "additions and clarifications" to the political declaration - the shorter of the two Brexit deal documents that outlines the UK's future relationship with the EU.Image: MPs will eventually vote again on a deal.Pic: UK Parliament/Mark Duffy But non-legally binding changes may not be enough to calm a Labour leader worried about a future Brexiteer prime minister ripping up the promises of their predecessor."Red lines must move", said Jeremy Corbyn.The problem for Theresa May, is it is those red lines that are keeping divisions in her party from turning into fully blown fractures.
Theresa May admits 'huge frustration' as she agrees Halloween Brexit delay:::::PM: We need to leave EU as soon as possible Theresa May has agreed a delay to Brexit until Halloween after EU leaders offered another extension to Article 50 at a late-night Brussels summit.:: Follow the latest updates on Brexit here In the early hours of the morning, leaders of the remaining 27 EU member states decided to give the prime minister an extra six-and-a-half-month period in which to break the Brexit deadlock at Westminster.European Council President Donald Tusk warned the UK: "Please do not waste this time."The second extension to Article 50 secured by Mrs May means a no-deal Brexit will now not take place at 11pm on Friday night, as the point of the UK's departure from the bloc shifts again.Advertisement Under the terms of the extension, if Mrs May finally gets her withdrawal agreement approved by the House of Commons prior to 31 October, the UK could leave the EU earlier than that date.Speaking at a news conference after the summit concluded, the prime minister acknowledged "huge frustration from many people" that she had to ask for another delay, which follows three defeats in parliament for her withdrawal agreement.Mrs May will explain the latest delay to Brexit to the House of Commons later, while the government will also continue cross-party talks with Labour aimed at reaching a compromise Brexit deal.She said: "The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade parliament to approve a deal which would allow the UK to leave in a smooth and orderly way."But the choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear."So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest."The prime minister insisted the UK could still avoid having to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May if her withdrawal agreement is finally approved by MPs in the first three weeks of next month.The government has begun preparations to hold those elections, but will cancel the polls if Brexit is agreed before they are due.The EU27 agreed, if the UK fails to leave the EU by 23 May but also does not hold European elections, it will leave with no deal on 1 June.May: 'I regret parliament was unable to pass a deal' Under the terms of the latest Brexit delay, the EU27 included a review point at the bloc's scheduled June summit, although Mr Tusk stressed this would not present another "cliff edge".Mrs May recommitted the UK to "sincere cooperation" during the extension, which follows claims by Tory Brexiteers that Britain could behave disruptively if stuck in a long delay to Brexit.Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte expected the extension to be the "last delay" to Brexit.He said: "On 31 October, the British will either have agreed to a deal, have decided to cancel Brexit or leave without a deal."But then we will have had six more months to prepare for that."Brexit special: Are voters impatient or indifferent?In talks lasting more than six hours, EU leaders were said to be divided over the terms of the offer to the UK.Seventeen member states were claimed to want a long extension to March next year.But French President Emmanuel Macron was said to be among those wanting a shorter extension to 30 June - as Mrs May had requested prior to the summit.Eventually, it appeared minimising disruption to EU institutions due to Brexit was forefront of leaders' minds, with the 31 October date coming on the eve of a new European Commission being installed in Brussels.In her news conference, Mrs May avoided questions over her future in Downing Street.Corbyn: May not dropping her Brexit red lines Earlier, former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith told Sky News that Mrs May should be gone before the Conservative Party conference at the end of September.But Tory sources said she was standing by commitments made to her party's 1922 committee that she would step down once her withdrawal agreement is ratified, which could now be as late as the end of October.This would allow a new Conservative leader to take over the second phase of Brexit negotiations, focused on the UK's future relationship with the EU.Mrs May had previously told MPs that "as prime minister" she could "not consider a delay further beyond 30 June".Despite the seriousness of Wednesday's summit, with the prospect of a no-deal Brexit looming, German Chancellor Angela Merkel shared a laugh with Mrs May as she used an iPad to share images of the both of them wearing similar blue outfits as they had addressed their respective parliaments earlier in the day.Image: Theresa May and Angela Merkel shared a joke about their matching outfits In a 66-minute address to EU27 leaders, during which she grilled by the bloc's heads of government, the prime minister then requested a further extension to the Article 50 period until 30 June.She spelled out how her government is currently engaged in cross-party talks with Labour with the aim of achieving a compromise Brexit deal that can finally end parliament's impasse.Mrs May then left the room as the EU27 discussed her request over a dinner of warm scallop salad, cod loin with brown shrimps and mini mushroom arancini, followed by iced macadamia nut parfait.She later returned to the summit building to be told the news of the EU27's decision by Mr Tusk.
What happens now the UK's Brexit date has been extended?:::::What happens now the UK's Brexit date has been extended?What happens now the UK's Brexit date has been extended?Theresa May has agreed an extension to the Brexit date, meaning the UK has another six months to secure a deal.As soon as MPs pass a deal in the Commons that has been agreed with the remaining EU27 countries, the UK will leave the European Union.Sky News looks at what happens in the next few weeks and months now that the next delay to Brexit has been confirmed.Image: Theresa May leaves Downing Street before heading to the summit :: 11 April Mrs May returns to the UK and gives a statement to the House of Commons about her latest summit in Brussels.Advertisement Cross-party talks continue with Labour in light of what happened at the European Council.:: 2 May - Local elections A number of local authorities in England and Northern Ireland holding elections on 2 May in the UK this year.They include 33 metropolitan districts, like Gateshead, Liverpool, and Stockport, that elect members by thirds.There are also 125 district councils holding full elections for all members.Another 54 district councils are electing their members by thirds and will have some 2019 votes.In addition, there will be elections in 30 unitary authorities, which will re-elect their entire chamber.Another 17 unitary authorities will elect a third of their members.The local elections will not have any direct impact on Brexit, but they are often seen to provide a reflection of the mood of the nation.The two main parties will be keen to hold on to and increase their share, and will view it as a further mandate to their Brexit course if they do so.There is also speculation that anger with the main parties in parliament, who are at the helm of the Brexit negotiations, will reflect in votes cast to other parties, spreading votes across more parties than usual.:: 23-26 May - European Parliament elections There are several key dates related to the European elections.The first two are 12 April and 15 April, which is when the UK has to give notice of an election to voters.Most of the UK has to give notice by 15 April, but the south west constituency, which includes Gibraltar, is meant to give this notice by 12 April.That's the same date the EU gave for its first extension on Brexit.The next key dates are 23-26 May, when voting will take place for MEPs across European Union states.These dates vary because each country holds the elections on the day of the week it usually goes to the polls.For the UK, this would be 23 May, the Thursday of that week, which is why the EU gave Mrs May the leaving date of 22 May if she had got her deal over the line in parliament.The UK will return 73 members in the elections and they would take up their seats in the parliament by the beginning of July.Image: Theresa May leaves her meeting with Emmanuel Macron in Paris Unlike the British parliament system, the European Parliament does not dissolve, it merely rises while elections go on.The new set-up is then formed after the votes are counted and finalised.The UK could leave the EU at any point having returned MEPs, and so new members should not get too comfortable.If the UK leaves the EU by the end of June, the MEPs will never take up their seats.They will quickly pull out if the UK leaves after this date.The government has promised to reimburse local authorities for costs incurred in running the elections if they do not take place.:: 1 June If the UK fails to hold European Parliament elections, it will be breaching its obligations as a member of the bloc and will be kicked out of the EU by 1 June.PM: We need to leave EU as soon as possible However the UK's notice of poll has been given and therefore election preparation is under way.It is highly unlikely the obligation will not be fulfilled.This date is also one Mrs May believes the UK could leave by if a deal passes through parliament in the first three weeks of May.In her statement after the summit, she said: "If we are able to pass a deal in the first three weeks of May, we will not have to take part in European elections and will officially leave the EU on Saturday, 1 June."But that relies on the legislation getting through both Houses in time - and that would see the laws changed very quickly indeed.:: 20-21 June This is the next date of a European Council meeting with a summit planned in Brussels.The EU27 will review the progress the UK has made toward getting a deal.Pressure from France's Emmanuel Macron led to this review date being added.He has been reluctant to implement a longer extension.:: 30 June This is the date Mrs May has offered on a number of occasions.It is significant because it is before the new MEPs are likely to sit in the European Parliament on 2 July.But the EU has consistently vetoed this date.They are not happy with it because of its proximity to the European Parliament's formation.Pulling out that soon would mean running elections without having the new MEPs sit in the new parliament, or allowing the UK to not participate in the polls, despite still being a member of the bloc.However, under a "flextension", this date is still perfectly possible, because the UK could pull out having passed a new deal on 29 June.Image: Theresa May has until 31 October to get a deal through parliament :: 2 July The new members of the European Parliament take their seats.:: Summer Parliament in the UK does not sit from mid-July until early September, a period known as summer recess.Last year, the House did not formally sit between 20 July and 4 September.This means there is a lot less work likely to be done and there could be delays either to getting legislation through or to coming up with a deal.:: September September marks party conference season, with Labour holding its conference on 21 September in Brighton, and the Conservatives travelling to Manchester on 29 September.Iain Duncan Smith, former leader of the Conservatives, called on Mrs May to be out of position by this date.Certainly those jostling to replace her may be hoping to set out their stalls to the party faithful at conference.But Mrs May promised she would leave the helm when a deal gets through parliament.As this date is before the new Brexit deadline, it could mean the dancing queen returning to the stage for another conference.'Do not waste this time' :: 31 October Trick or treat?This is the next date for leaving the EU with or without a deal.It is also the final day in office for the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.Should the country be ready to leave on this date, it is unlikely the UK MEPs will have had any hand in selecting his successor.:: 12 December This date marks one year since Mrs May survived a confidence vote on her leadership of the Conservative Party.Mrs May faced down opposition to her leadership, promising she would go before another election.She then promised she would leave before the next stage of Brexit negotiations, seeing her withdrawal agreement go through and passing over to someone else to allow future talks on the political declaration to go ahead.But with no end date in sight for getting her deal through, there could well be another chance for MPs to revolt.She is safe for one year under Conservative Party rules, so no contest could be held before this date.There is word that EU leaders have been concerned about offering her an extension beyond this date because of that threat over her future.
Trump: Grand budget deal ‘not happening!’:::::President Donald Trump's jeers come on the heels of House Democrats failure to pass a bill that would stave off $126 billion in spending cuts.| Evan Vucci/AP Photo Appropriations Trump: Grand budget deal not happening!President Donald Trump scoffed Thursday night at the idea of striking a bipartisan two-year deal to ward off billions of dollars in spending cuts.House Democrats want to negotiate a $2 TRILLION spending increase but cant even pass their own plan.We cant afford it anyway, and its not happening!Trump tweeted.Story Continued Below The presidents jeers come on the heels of House Democrats failure this week to muster the support to pass a bill that would stave off $126 billion in spending cuts in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, as well as cuts in the fiscal year that follows.While the proposal would increase discretionary spending to about $1.3 trillion for the upcoming fiscal year, the Trump administration contends that it would lead to nearly $2 trillion in spending increases over 10 years.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced this week that he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are beginning negotiations on a two-year deal to raise budget caps.McConnell said he talked to the president about the negotiations last week.But Trump administration officials maintain that the president is satisfied with letting the budget cuts take effect.In his budget request for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, Trump called for those spending cuts to eat away at non-defense funding.But he proposed protecting Pentagon spending by diverting billions of dollars to a special war account that does not count against those budget caps.Congress would have to sign off on such a move, however, necessitating a bipartisan budget deal if Trump wants to protect defense spending.

McConnell responded hours later that Schumer was the father of gridlock, having blocked George W. Bushs judicial picks more than a decade ago.I know exactly who started it, McConnell said.Then Congress promptly left town for a two-week recess, frustrating members in both parties, who lamented the state of the Senate and said they hoped the situation couldnt get worse.But it just might, senators from both parties admitted.The fact that weve had political vote after political vote after political vote while theres issues like climate change and comprehensive immigration [reform] that we dont take up yeah, said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.)when asked if the Senate had bottomed out.Were an awful lot like the House now.Its no longer The Greatest Deliberative Body.Its just another body.Were seeing what can happen if we dont fix some things that we got to fix, but I dont think we hit rock bottom by any stretch, added Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.).Unfortunately, you could go a lot further than were going right now.Some thought the 2016 retirement of Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada would improve the state of the Senate, and in a certain sense, it has.The personal relationship between McConnell and Schumer has not been nearly as toxic as was the relationship between Reid and McConnell.Theyre a couple of old pros.They dont take it personally, insisted Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) of the two current leaders.Yet functionally, the McConnell-Schumer dynamic isnt really much different.Each party has grown more ideologically rigid as the moderate core of the Senate has either been ousted or retired.And Trumps unpredictable nature makes legislating immeasurably more difficult.As Republicans changed the Senate rules last week, McConnell and Schumer engaged in a fierce tit-for-tat on the floor culminating with McConnell literally pointing at Schumer as the one to blame.It was an ugly moment for the Senate.Yet these types of bitter personal exchanges have become routine, and a growing number of senators just try to tune it all out.I was working, man....I was working on policy, said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) when asked about the McConnell-Schumer exchange.McConnells own drive to remake the judiciary with conservative nominees, and his decision to block Merrick Garlands ascension to the Supreme Court in 2016, infuriates Democrats to no end.Spend more than 30 seconds talking to any Senate Democrat, and Garland's name is pulled out.It's the wound that never heals.Nuclear Mitch has pulled the trigger twice and there are many people who think hes ready to do it again, said Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who summed up the leaders relationship as Not good, not good.Merrick Garland and [McConnells] nuclear changes are changing the Senate.Its a shame for a man who prides himself with a long personal history of the Senate, Durbin said of McConnell.Schumer, for his part, is under enormous pressure from the liberal grassroots as well as a half-dozen Senate Democrats running for president to resist Trump at every turn.The days of Schumer waving through lower-level judicial nominees without dissent are over, and it seems to do no harm to Schumer.The Democratic leader has a poor relationship with Trump, who refers to him as Cryin Chuck, so theres little for him to lose.On Thursday, Schumer who only last fall said he may bring back the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees if Democrats take back the majority next year seemed open to the idea of eliminating or scaling back the legislative filibuster.Our focus should be on winning the majority.We'll have a nice caucus of more than 50 Democrats, and we will decide what to do, Schumer told reporters.You can think about a whole lot of things.I've taken no position on any of this.Such talk from a party leader would have been blasphemy in the old Senate, yet it's pro forma these days.All of which has led some senators to consider whether its time to ship out.Its not what I expected.Its not what I thought, what I heard, what I read about, said Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who is thinking about running for governor even though he won another six-year Senate term just last fall.Im getting to the end of my career, Manchin added.Do I want to end my career where I can be most effective?Im looking at that, to be honest with you.Some members insist the Senate can be saved and that serious legislating can still be done.Retiring Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said McConnell has assured him that if he's able to make a bipartisan breakthrough on higher education or reducing health costs, the GOP leader would bring it to the floor.McConnell also said Thursday hed be willing to entertain infrastructure or immigration proposals that have bedeviled past Congresses.But senators want to do more than just talk about what they might do.They want to get moving.I sure hope not, Alexander said when asked whether the Senate might primarily focus on nominations during his last two years in the chamber.Weve got a whole lot more to do than that.Schumer also told reporters that he and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will meet with Trump on infrastructure in "the next several weeks," but warned that "if they're not going to put real money and have real labor and environmental protections, we're not going to get anywhere."The coming release of the Mueller report will dominate the near term on Capitol Hill, but there is some legislative business that can't be avoided.Congress has to pass some funding measure to avoid another shutdown by the end of September, something both sides say they want to do.The U.S. government also will hit the debt limit around the same time, and Congress will have to authorize trillions in new borrowing or potentially spark a global financial crisis.And the two Senate leaders, along with Trump, Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), will have to work out a deal this fall to raise budget caps or face draconian cuts to domestic and defense programs.McConnell described such an agreement as the most important example how in divided government you need to step up.The budget negotiations may provide the best litmus test on whether the Senate is truly broken.Your test is going to be: Do we get to a good budget deal?Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said.If we flounder on the budget deal, then come back and ask me if weve hit rock bottom.

‘Lack of enthusiasm’ leaves Herman Cain’s Fed nomination all but dead:::::"There was a lack of enthusiasm among a number of our members about that particular nominee," Mitch McConnell said of Herman Cain.| Carolyn Kaster/AP Photo congress Lack of enthusiasm leaves Herman Cains Fed nomination all but dead Trumps unconventional pick for the Federal Reserve appears to have no path to Senate confirmation.Mitch McConnell on Thursday confirmed whats become painfully obvious this week: Theres a lack of enthusiasm among Senate Republicans to installing Herman Cain at the Federal Reserve.The Senate Majority leaders remarks to reporters came as four GOP senators have signaled they would vote against the former businessman and presidential candidate either over his lack of experience or because of sexual harassment allegations against him.Story Continued Below And Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said in a C-SPAN Newsmakers interview with POLITICO that he was unlikely to support Cain, essentially leaving him without a road to the 50 votes needed for confirmation in the Senate.There was a lack of enthusiasm among a number of our members about that particular nominee, McConnell said of Cain.GOP Sens.Mitt Romney of Utah, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota have said they would currently oppose Cain.Cramer delivered the finishing blow, telling Bloomberg on Thursday: If I had to vote today, I couldnt vote for Herman Cain.I dont think I can.I dont think hes qualified for the position, Manchin said of Cain.McConnell said he has not spoken to President Donald Trump about Cain, who has not been formally nominated yet.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.But the Kentucky Republican did publicly offer some blunt advice for the administration as it floats Cain and Stephen Moore for the Fed and immigration hard-liners Ken Cuccinelli and Kris Kobach to lead the Department of Homeland Security.There are two things the administration ought to consider before nominating someone: first a background check and second, likelihood of confirmation.And generally better to check that up in advance before you send that nomination up, McConnell said on Thursday afternoon.There are a number of members ... who had some reservations about some of the names that have been mentioned.McConnell declined to handicap the remaining controversial nominees, except for one: Cuccinelli, who has run the Senate Conservatives Fund since 2014.The former Virginia attorney general joined the group right after SCF failed in its attempt to defeat McConnell in his primary against Matt Bevin.I have expressed my, shall I say, lack of enthusiasm, for one of them who was mentioned in some story and that was Ken Cuccinelli, who used to run the Senate Conservatives Fund.And may still run it, McConnell said.But again, he hasnt been nominated.
Dems rush to Omar’s aid amid conservative backlash on 9/11 comments:::::Rep. Ilhan Omar has come under fire for her description of Sept. 11, 2001, and how the terrorist attacks contributed to the rise of Islamophobia.| Mark Wilson/Getty Images congress Dems rush to Omars aid amid conservative backlash on 9/11 comments LEESBURG, VA. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other House Democrats are jumping to the defense of Rep. Ilhan Omar as she faces yet another wave of conservative attacks for her recent remarks on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.We are getting to the level where this is an incitement of violence against progressive women of color, Ocasio-Cortez told reporters at the House Democratic retreat here Thursday.Story Continued Below And if they cant figure out how to get it back to policy we need to call it out for what it is.Because this is not normal, and this is not a normal level of political debate or rhetoric.The Minnesota Democrat has come under fire this week for describing Sept. 11, 2001, as a day when some people did something, as she described how that act of terrorism contributed to the rise in Islamophobia globally.POLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and frankly, Im tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it, Omar said last month at an event hosted by the Council on American-Islamic Relations.CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something, and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.Omars allies have said that her remarks which were part of a 20-minute speech have been taken grossly out of context by conservative websites.That backlash inspired an inflammatory New York Post cover on Thursday, which featured a photo of a flaming World Trade Center building with the caption, Heres your something.2,977 people dead by terrorism.The controversy has also sparked a testy back-and-forth on Twitter between Ocasio-Cortez and freshman GOP Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a Navy SEAL who lost his right eye during an IED attack in Afghanistan.Crenshaw seized on Omars comments, calling them unbelievable in a Wednesday tweet.First Member of Congress to ever describe terrorists who killed thousands of Americans on 9/11 as some people who did something, he added.Ocasio-Cortez later fired back on Twitter.You refuse to cosponsor the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund, yet have the audacity to drum resentment towards Ilhan w/completely out-of-context quotes, the New York freshman wrote and then urged Crenshaw to go do something about domestic terrorism spurred by right-wing extremists.Ocasio-Cortez also told reporters that it was incredibly upsetting and triggering for the Rupert Murdoch-owned New York Post to elicit such an image for such a transparently and politically motivated attack on Ilhan.Its transparent.Frankly, this is getting to a level thats beyond politics or partisanship, she added.Rep. Max Rose, a moderate Democrat who represents Staten Island, tried to play mediator between the two high-profile freshman lawmakers.Lets be clear, words matter: we were attacked by terrorists on 9/11.Thousands were murdered, too many of whom were from my district, Rose responded on Twitter.But actions matter too, he added, encouraging Crenshaw to become a co-sponsor of the 9/11 victims legislation.Another high-profile freshman progressive, Rep. Ayanna Pressley, accused the New York Post ownership of stoking hate, fear & division, putting REAL lives at risk.Rep. Pramila Jayapal, co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, described the publications cover as pretty outrageous.Shes getting a lot of scrutiny.I know she knows she has to be careful about what she says, Jayapal told reporters at the Democratic retreat here on Thursday.I also know theres a lot of scrutiny on here thats not on other people.And Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), another high-profile progressive freshman, defended her sister, saying critics of Omar were putting her life at risk by taking those words out of context.They do this all the time to us, especially women of color, Tlaib said on MSNBC.They do that, they take our words out of context because theyre afraid, because we speak truth, we speak truth to power.Rep. Katherine Clark, vice chair for the House Democratic Caucus, said on Thursday that Omars status as one of the first Muslim women in Congress has drawn sharper scrutiny.What we have seen with Ilhan Omar is she is the first Muslim woman to wear a hijab in the House of Congress and that has made her a target for some people, Clark said in an interview Thursday.My understanding is that she is trying to promote that Muslim people should be addressed individually, and that she is hoping for equity, Clark said.
Schumer won't commit to keeping filibuster if Dems win majority:::::"I've always said in terms of the rules and these things, let's first win the majority, then we'll make the decisions and the caucus will come together," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Schumer won't commit to keeping filibuster if Dems win majority Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer won't commit to retaining the filibuster if Democrats win control of the chamber in 2020, the latest sign of trouble for the Senate's most hallowed and controversial tradition.Several Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens.Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have called for eliminating or scaling back the filibuster, and Democratic Party activists are also pushing to end to the practice, which is more than 200 years old.Story Continued Below When pressed on the issue by reporters during a Thursday news conference, Schumer said his only focus is winning the majority, and if that happens, then Democrats can talk about whether to change Senate rules."I've always said in terms of the rules and these things, let's first win the majority, then we'll make the decisions and the caucus will come together," Schumer said.Just last year, Schumer talked about restoring the filibuster on Supreme Court nominees, a requirement that Republicans eliminated in April 2017 to end debate on the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the high court.Yet Schumer wouldn't repeat that stance on Thursday."Our focus should be on winning the majority.We'll have a nice caucus of more than 50 Democrats, and we will decide what to do," Schumer said."You can think about a whole lot of things.I've taken no position on any of this."

House Democrats are grappling with how to address the surge of migrants at the border, amid divisions over how to respond to President Donald Trumps hard-line approach.For Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her deputies, the risks of diving into a fight with the president are clear.Story Continued Below It was health care and the economy, not immigration, that Democrats ran on and helped deliver the House.And Democrats worry about playing into Trumps narrative and potentially losing control of the debate if they spend too much time reacting to Trumps controversial moves, from his purge of top immigration officials to the possibility hell reinstitute controversial policies to separate children from their parents.But Democrats also acknowledge that despite Trumps bluster, thousands of Central American migrants are indeed streaming toward the border each day and overwhelming a dysfunctional system.And the party cant escape the issue if it wanted to, as both Pelosi and Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) faced multiple questions on the topic Thursday morning at House Democrats three-day retreat here.POLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.Its complicated but it isnt hard to do if you have good intentions, Pelosi told reporters of the need to pass comprehensive immigration reform to deal with the broader issues at hand.And Im not giving up on the president on this.But House Democrats have no plans to put a comprehensive immigration bill on the floor anytime soon, and privately, senior Democrats cant even agree about the best approach to the issue that Trump has made a centerpiece of his presidency.Democrats say any bipartisan immigration talks are likely fruitless with Trump in the White House.And the efforts could backfire, sparking conflict within the party over the lefts calls to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The debate has resurfaced within the caucus over the past week as top Democrats watched with alarm as the president purged top officials from the Department of Homeland Security at the behest of senior adviser Stephen Miller, who is guiding the White Houses immigration crackdown.I think that Democrats need to say, Well what is our vision to solve the crisis?Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) said in an interview.The reality is there is a problem the numbers are increasing.We cant have a situation of 100,000 people coming to our border and be able to deal with that humanely and justly.So what is our solution?Some Democrats have floated the idea of a floor vote on Congress last major attempt at a comprehensive immigration overhaul a bipartisan Senate bill written in 2013 by the so-called Gang of Eight.The idea has come up in multiple leadership meetings over the past week, though the proposal has not gained traction with Pelosi and her team, according to multiple lawmakers in the room.Meanwhile, other top Democrats led by California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee have begun drafting legislation to provide more financial aid to Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, where most migrants are coming from to seek refuge in the U.S.But its not clear if or when that plan might come to the floor, and House Democrats are skeptical it would be well received in the GOP-controlled Senate or by a White House that is moving to cut aid to the Northern Triangle of Central American countries.For now, Democrats are starting with a fact-finding mission.Several members, led by California Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, have planned a multiday trip to Texas and California that will depart immediately after the caucuss policy retreat.House Democrats also have plans to vote in the coming weeks on more narrow immigration bills, including restoring legal protections for children of unauthorized immigrants, known as Dreamers.The House could also vote on a resolution condemning Trumps threats to shut down the border.But neither of those proposals would directly address what's happening at the border right now.Border Patrol agents apprehended 92,607 people in March two-thirds of whom are families or unaccompanied children.Its the highest monthly total since 2007.Pelosi told reporters Thursday shes talked with the president only in passing about immigration in recent months, stressing to him that Congress and the administration should come together on a comprehensive package.Pelosi also argued that Congress has already addressed immigration in one way this year passing legislation to reopen the government after the 35-day showdown over Trumps border wall but the president hasnt fully used the money provided in that bill.We had bipartisan legislation, bicameral legislation that gave the president a formula to bring order to the border, Pelosi said.And it was about funding for more judges, it was about humanitarian assistance to accommodate those coming in.Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) noted Thursday that the bill to end the shutdown provided funding to boost agency personnel, improve detention facilities and speed up asylum processing."We provided a substantial additional investment in those areas.We may, in fact have to do more," Cicilline told reporters."Were not looking on helplessly."Communication between the White House and House Democratic leaders has been sparse.Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney met with a handful of Senate Democrats to talk about the migrant crisis earlier this week but has not had a similar meeting with Pelosi or her staff, according to an aide.Lawmakers will eventually be forced to confront questions over immigration and the border when the House takes up legislation to fund DHS; that bill is expected to reach the floor in June.But Democrats are wary of trying to do anything immigration-related with Trump given how erratic he has been in the past seemingly open to a bipartisan deal only to back away and instead push hard-line policies like family separation.Theres a clear solution there for the taking.The problem is, the president doesnt want a solution because if he gets a solution, his single reason for being goes away, Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said of the 2013 comprehensive reform bill.Hes not interested in solving this problem, hes using it as fuel.People know that we have a White House that has flirted with this and every time anything gets close to being serious, they walk back and walk out of the room, added a senior Democratic aide.I just think its impossible to deal with Stephen Miller in the White House.

Pelosi: Trump’s Fed picks are 'really dangerous':::::There are so many bridges too far here, but this is a really dangerous one," Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of the president's picks for the Federal Reserve.| Alex Edelman/Getty Images Congress Pelosi: Trumps Fed picks are 'really dangerous' LEESBURG, Va. Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday sharply criticized President Donald Trumps planned picks for the Federal Reserve, Herman Cain and Stephen Moore, warning that the hyperpartisan duo would be dangerous for the economy.With stiff competition, these two appointments to the Fed are the worst, ill-suited appointments that the president could come up with, Pelosi told reporters at a news briefing on the second day of the House Democratic Caucus retreat.There are so many bridges too far here, but this is a really dangerous one.Democrats and Republicans alike have skewered Cain, a former pizza magnate, and Moore, a former member of the Wall Street Journal editorial board, to the central banks coveted board of governors.Story Continued Below The stakes are high, Democrats argue, because Trump has repeatedly lashed out Chairman Jerome Powell on Twitter for hiking interest rates and has reportedly threatened to fire him.Its not clear to me whether thats reality or a 'Saturday Night Live' skit, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries told reporters Thursday morning.Its an embarrassment and the likelihood is that they will be withdrawn.Powell will speak to House Democrats in a closed-door session later Thursday at which theyve said they want him to talk about kitchen table economic issues.But theyre also likely to bring up Trumps intentions to swing the boards governors to his favor.Adding close Trump allies to the seven-member board would dramatically reshape the traditionally nonpolitical institution.But Trumps picks with little monetary policy experience but a lot of political baggage have distressed Republican lawmakers, muddying the path forward in the Senate.When you have two people totally ill-suited, unqualified for the position because they may just go in and say, The president wants an increase in rates so were here to do that, Pelosi said.Thank God, Chairman Powell is there.

McConnell can provide input and guidance and let the president know whats passable and whats not, he said.Thune said he didnt have any advance notice on Cains nomination, adding sometimes the president in terms of his style of operation tends to be more freewheeling.Thats something weve just had to learn to adapt to, he said.

Dem challenges JPMorgan CEO to try and budget employee's low salary:::::Democratic Rep. Katie Porter (Calif.) grilled JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during a Wednesday hearing, challenging the billionaire about how a single mother working as a Chase bank teller should budget out her starting salary.During a House Financial Services Committee hearing that included the CEOs of a handful of major banks, Porter shared the story of a woman, meant to represent several of Porter's constituents, who takes home $2,425 each month from her job with JPMorgan Chase and shares a room with her daughter in a one-bedroom apartment in Irvine, Calif., that costs roughly $1,600 a month.The congresswoman said that after the woman spends about $100 of her paycheck each month on utilities and more on food, travel, rent and child care, she ends up with a deficit of $567 a month."How should she manage this budget shortfall while she's working full-time at your bank?"she asked Dimon during the hearing."I don't know that all your numbers are accurate, that number is generally a starter job," he responded."She is a starting employee, she has a 6-year-old child, this is her first job," Porter replied."You can get those jobs out of high school, and she may have my job one day," Dimon said."She may, but Mr. Dimon, she doesn't have the ability right now to spend your $31 million," Porter fired back, referring to the CEOs pay package last year."I'm wholly sympathetic," Dimon said in response."She's short $567, what would you suggest she do?"Porter asked."I don't know, I'd have to think about that," Dimon said."Would you recommend that she take out a JPMorgan Chase credit card and run a deficit?"Porter continued."I don't know, I'd have to think about it, the CEO repeated."Would you recommend that she overdraft at your bank and be charged overdraft fees?"Porter asked."I don't know, I'd have to think about it," Dimon again repeated, adding that hed "love to call up and have a conversation about her financial affairs and see if we could be helpful.""[To] see if you could find a way for her to live on less than the minimum that I've described?"Porter said."Just [to] be helpful," Dimon responded."Well, I appreciate your desire to be helpful, but what I'd like you to do is provide a way for families to make ends meet," Porter added.Shortly after the hearing, the congresswoman shared a photo on Twitter of a white board on which she calculated the womans expenses.During my questioning, @jpmorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he didnt know if all my numbers were accurate.Heres the math so he can check.pic.twitter.com/OIDkrWfASC Rep. Katie Porter (@RepKatiePorter) April 10, 2019 Porter told CNN during a Thursday interview that the woman, whom she called "Patricia," was a hypothetical person who represented multiple stories that have been heard by her office.She is "a representative of a number of constituents that we'd heard from," Porter said.However, Porter described an actual job listing during the hearing that was shared on Monster.com and advertises a bank teller position paying an hourly wage of $16.50."So there is no Patricia out there," Porter said, "but in the other way, there are thousands and thousands, and tens of thousands of Patricias out there."
Alan Dershowitz: Is Julian Assange another Pentagon Papers case?:::::Before WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange gained asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012, he and his British legal team asked me to fly to London to provide legal advice about United States law relating to espionage and press freedom.I cannot disclose what advice I gave them, but I can say that I believed then, and still believe now, that there is no constitutional difference between WikiLeaks and The New York Times.If The New York Times, in 1971, could lawfully publish the Pentagon Papers, knowing that it included classified documents stolen by Rand Corporation military analyst Daniel Ellsberg from our government, then WikiLeaks was entitled, under the First Amendment, to publish classified material that Assange knew was stolen by former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning from our government.ADVERTISEMENT So if prosecutors were to charge Assange with espionage or any other crime for merely publishing the Manning material, this would be another Pentagon Papers case with the same likely outcome.Many people misunderstand the actual Supreme Court ruling in the 1971 case.It did not say that the newspapers that were planning to publish the Pentagon Papers could not be prosecuted if they published classified material.It only said they could not be restrained that is, stopped in advance from publishing them.They did publish, and they were not prosecuted.The same result would probably follow if Assange were prosecuted for publishing classified material on WikiLeaks, though there is no guarantee that prosecutors might not try to distinguish the two cases on the grounds that The New York Times is a more responsible media outlet than WikiLeaks.But the First Amendment does not recognize degrees of responsibility.Indeed, when the First Amendment was written, our nation was plagued with irresponsible scandal sheets and broadsides.No one ever described political pamphleteers Thomas Paine or James Callender as responsible journalists.It is likely, therefore, that a prosecution of Assange for merely publishing classified material would fail.Moreover, Great Britain might be unwilling to extradite Assange for such a political crime.That is why prosecutors have chosen to charge him with a different crime: conspiracy to help Manning break into a government computer to steal classified material.Such a crime, if proven beyond a reasonable doubt, would have a far weaker claim to constitutional protection.The courts have ruled that journalists may not break the law in an effort to obtain material whose disclosure would be protected by the First Amendment.The problem with the current effort is that, while it might be legally strong, it seems on the face of the indictment to be factually weak.It alleges that Assange encouraged Manning to provide information and records from government agencies.It alleges that Manning provided Assange with part of a password and that Assange requested more information.But it goes on to say that although Assange had been trying to crack the password, he had no luck so far.Not the strongest set of facts!The first question is whether a legal theory based on such inchoate facts will be sufficient for an extradition request to be granted.Even if it is, a grant of extradition could be appealed through several layers of courts, which would take a long time.The second question is what would happen to Assange while these appeals proceeded.If he were locked up, he might well waive extradition in the hope of winning his case in the United States.The third question is whether American prosecutors might amend the indictment to make it legally and factually stronger and, if they did, whether they would do so before or after he was extradited.The last question is whether Manning will testify against Assange.It is not clear whether prosecutors really need her testimony or whether they can make the case based on emails and other documents, but her testimony surely would be helpful if she were to corroborate or expand on the paper trail.President Obama commuted her sentence in 2017 and she was freed from prison, but she was jailed last month for refusing to testify against Assange before a grand jury.She could be given immunity from further prosecution and compelled to testify.But if she refused, would they keep her in prison?There are lots of moving parts to this process, all of which make its outcome and timetable unpredictable.Alan M.

Julian Assange: Five things to know about the legal case against him:::::U.S. officials have unveiled long-awaited charges against Julian Assange, alleging that the WikiLeaks founder conspired to hack a government computer in connection with the organizations release of sensitive government files back in 2010.The news came shortly after Assange was expelled from the Ecuadorian Embassy and arrested by British authorities, after nearly seven years in asylum there.ADVERTISEMENT As the founder of WikiLeaks, Assange is infamous for document leaks that have embarrassed the United States over the years.The organization most recently captured notoriety for leaking hacked Democratic emails that the U.S. intelligence community later tied to a plot by Russia to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.Here are five things to know about the charges against Assange.Allegations date back to secret diplomatic cables The allegations laid out in the indictment trace back more than a decade, when WikiLeaks obtained and published Afghanistan and Iraq war logs as well as secret diplomatic cables from former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning.According to the charging document, Assange allegedly agreed to assist Manning in cracking a password to a classified government computer in March 2010, after already having received hundreds of thousands of classified records from Manning that WikiLeaks planned to release publicly.It is unclear whether the hacking effort was successful.The indictment notes that the password cracking measure would have made it more difficult for investigators to identify Manning as the source of disclosures of classified information.The WikiLeaks founder also allegedly egged Manning on to provide additional information, telling her, curious eyes never run dry in my experience.Manning was eventually convicted in 2013 on multiple counts, including violations of the Espionage Act and for copying and disseminating classified military field reports.U.S. military prosecutors argued at the time of Mannings court case in 2013 that her leak likely provided intelligence to U.S. enemies like al Qaeda and other Islamic militant groups.Manning ultimately served seven years of a 35-year prison sentence the longest-ever imposed in a leak case before then-President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaObama pays tribute to Nipsey Hussle: 'A legacy worthy of celebration' Will Biden lead a 'return to normalcy' in 2020?New York student says teacher wouldn't let her pick Trump for class project on heroes MORE commuted her sentence.Assange has long evaded federal authorities, remaining beyond their reach by seeking asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London starting in 2012 when he was facing an investigation for rape allegations in Sweden.The Embassy, however, grew tired of hosting the fugitive, claiming he violated the terms of his asylum and accused him of discourteous and aggressive behavior, which ultimately led to his arrest.Assange faces charges tied to hacking The charge unveiled Thursday alleges that Assange conspired with Manning to access classified information on government networks.The indictment does not say if the information was successfully obtained.The charge did not allege criminal conduct in WikiLeaks publication of the files accessed by Manning, though the indictment notes that WikiLeaks publicly released the vast majority of the classified records provided by Manning on the web in 2010 and 2011.ADVERTISEMENT Mark Zaid, a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in national security cases, asserted that the charging choice represented an intentional effort by U.S. prosecutors to avoid alleging offenses that could raise concern about freedom of the press.The indictment is a very deliberate decision by the U.S. government to pursue Assange without crossing the line to raise First Amendment concerns for a legitimate journalist, Zaid said.Press advocacy groups, however, pushed back against the premise that Assanges arrest was unrelated to the publication by WikiLeaks of classified information.They argue that its unlikely that Assange would be charged at all if he hadnt been responsible for releasing the documents.I think that the Trump administration has some unique hostility to the media, said Kathleen McClellan, the deputy director for the whistleblower and source protection program at ExposeFacts.And indicting Julian Assange and then having him arrested and seeking his extradition is a real threat to the media.Edward Snowden also decried Assanges arrest as a dark moment for press freedom.And of one Assanges attorneys, Jennifer Robinson, told reporters outside of court that the precedent means that any journalist can be extradited for prosecution in the United States for having published truthful information about the United States.Mueller is elephant in room Special counsel Robert Mueller Robert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MOREs investigation is somewhat of an elephant in the room with the indictment against Assange.The indictment unsealed Thursday makes no mention of Assanges involvement in the release of troves of stolen Democratic emails in 2016, though much of the talk about the WikiLeaks founder has centered on that for the last two years.U.S. officials tied the email hack to a plot by the Russian government to meddle in the last presidential election, which was under investigation by Mueller until last month.Muellers indictments offered glimpses at WikiLeaks involvement in the Russia plot, raising suspicions Assange might eventually face charges in connection with the interference campaign.The special counsels indictment charging 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking offenses last July referred to WikiLeaks as Organization 1 and alleged that the Russians, posing as the hacking group Guccifer 2.0, discussed the release of the stolen documents and the timing of those releases with Organization 1 to heighten their impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Mueller concluded the 22-month probe in March without recommending further charges.Other figures caught up in the Mueller probe were also questioned over their contacts with Assange ahead of the 2016 election, such as one-time Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone Roger Jason StoneRoger Stone knocks Barbara Bush: 'Her attack on me from beyond the grave required an answer' Trump on WikiLeaks after Assange arrest: 'It's not my thing' Giuliani: Nadler should have access to 'everything' in Mueller report MORE, who was widely scrutinized over statements he made in 2016 that appeared to predict WikiLeaks release of the damaging Democratic emails.He denied having any contact with Assange, but claimed he had a backchannel into the group.Stone was indicted in January on seven counts in connection with Mueller's investigation, including lying about his contacts with Trump campaign officials about WikiLeaks, and is set to face a trial in November.Its possible that Muellers full report will shed more light on WikiLeaks machinations.And if and when Assange is extradited to the U.S. to face charges, the Russia investigation will likely come up at his trial.Assange has dismissed criticisms, stating that he acted like other journalists would when they seek to leak classified documents that are of public interest.He also repeatedly denied that Russia was his source for the emails.Extradition battle approaches While Assange was arrested at the request of American officials, he will still have to go through the extradition process before he goes to trial.Under an extradition treaty between the U.K. and the U.S., American authorities have to provide evidence of Assanges alleged crime, like the charging document revealed on Thursday.But the U.S. almost ran out of time to bring a charge against Assange: Tor Ekeland, an attorney who specializes in cybersecurity, told The Hill that the sealed indictment was filed toward the end of the statute of limitations for the charge.Any later, he said, and Assange could have slipped through prosecutors fingers.Its highly possible that Assange could face future charges in the U.S.: Multiple reports Thursday indicated that the Justice Department will unveil another complaint against the WikiLeaks founder in the near future.Manning is also in federal prison in Virginia, after she was held in contempt for refusing to testify before a federal grand jury in a case believed to be related to WikiLeaks.Ekeland said that it wouldnt make sense for Thursdays indictment to be the case that Manning was called in to testify about, as the charge had been filed under seal in 2018, pointing to a new charge related to WikiLeaks coming down the line.British authorities could be wary of sending Assange overseas before they have a full picture of the charges he would face in an American court.Assange is also facing an allegation of rape in Sweden, and the country reportedly received a request on Thursday to reopen the case.That means the nation could also request that Assange be extradited there, setting up a potential showdown with the U.S.Bipartisan support for charges Thursdays developments illuminated the bipartisan vitriol for Assange that exists in Washington.Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle celebrated the news of Assanges indictment.Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham Lindsey Olin GrahamChuck Todd rips Barr on spying remarks: 'The attorney general gaslit the country' Republicans writing off hard-line DHS candidate

EPA Chief Says Climate Change Is Not His Top Priority:::::The head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defended big energy infrastructure projects and said Thursday that climate change is not his highest priority.Speaking to Reuters from his Washington D.C. office, agency chief Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, said that concerns about the impact of climate change were overblown under former President Barack Obamas administration.Wheeler, unlike President Donald Trumps first EPA chief, reiterated that he does not dismiss human-caused climate change, or contradict mainstream climate science, however.I said before I took this job that I believe in climate change and man has an impact on climate change, he told Reuters.But Wheeler did cast doubt on a study released this week by EPA scientists in the journal Nature Climate Change which detailed the urgency of the issue and pressed for early adoption of mitigating strategies.Just because our scientists publish something in a journal doesnt mean that thats agency policy or all the other scientists at the agency agree with that particular study, he said.The measures proposed in the paper, he added, are not EPA policy.Read More: Heres What the EPAs Website Looks Like After a Year of Climate Change Censorship Wheeler said he believes that water, not climate change, is the number one environmental challenge facing the planet today.When you have a thousand children that die a day from lack of drinking water, thats a crisis and thats a crisis that we we collectively as the world know how to solve that problem, he said, according to Reuters.Last year, a landmark U.N. report gave the world 12 years to avert a climate catastrophe and pressed governments to act urgently.President Trump has sought to boost fossil fuel production in the U.S. and earlier this week issued two executive orders to push states to speed up oil and gas pipeline construction.Wheeler said the EPA will soon release clarifications and parameters for states to veto energy projects over environmental concerns.If the states that are blocking the pipelines were truly concerned about the environment they would look to where [their imported] natural gas would be coming from, and they are forcing the New England states to use Russian-produced natural gas which is not as clean as U.S. natural gas, Wheeler said.I think its very short-sighted.Contact us at editors@time.com.
White House Urged Busing Migrants to Sanctuary Cities: Report:::::White House officials urged immigration authorities to release migrant detainees from the southern border into so-called sanctuary cities as retaliation against the administrations political opponents, the Washington Post reported Thursday.Members of the Trump administration proposed busing migrants to the cities, which are dubbed sanctuaries because local authorities there have refused to assist with the deportation of undocumented immigrants, according to the Post.The move was proposed in November 2018 as a caravan of Central American migrants advanced, and then again this past February as politicians feuded over funding for Trumps border wall, emails reviewed by the Post and interviews with the Department of Homeland Security revealed.Immigrations and Customs Enforcement dismissed the idea as inappropriate.A statement by the Department of Homeland Security appears to corroborate the Posts report.This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion, DHS said in the statement, according to the Post.Read More: Trump Vowed to Slow Border Crossings.Now Theyve Hit a 12-Year High According to DHS officials, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosis district in San Francisco was one of the proposed release areas, as were other Democrat-controlled districts.The White House reportedly told ICE that the transfer would provide a solution for the lack of detention space, while also sending a message to Democrats.Democrats have condemned the reported proposal.The extent of this administrations cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated, Ashley Etienne, a spokesperson for Pelosi, said.Using human beings including little children as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable.Contact us at editors@time.com.
President Trump Wants To Make Immigration Key in 2020. Who Does That Help?:::::The shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security this week suggests that President Trump is angling to make immigration a centerpiece of the 2020 election.The bet, it seems, is that if the President pushes the border back into the political limelight, it will animate his basewhile forcing Democrats onto the defensive.But will the strategy work?Political analysts say its a mixed bag.On the one hand, the nation is deeply divided on immigration.A slight majority disapproves of Trumps hardline policies overall, with larger numbers outright rejecting the Presidents most controversial tactics.For example, two-thirds of Americans opposed Trumps now-shelved zero tolerance policy of separating families at the U.S.-Mexico border, according to a poll last June.Trumps signature campaign promise to build a border wall isnt popular either: in a January Pew Research Center survey, 58% of respondents opposed significantly expanding the existing barrier with Mexico.On the other hand, the Presidents core voters are motivated by the debate over illegal immigration.A recent Pew survey found that Republican support for the border wall is now at an all-time high.Ensuring that immigration remains a headline story, especially on conservative news outlets like Fox News, may therefore help Trump get his base to the polls in 2020, as it did in both 2016 and in the lead up to the 2018 midterm election.Last fall, amid widespread, and largely exaggerated, reports of a migrant caravan heading towards the US, Gallup found that the number of Americans who cited immigration as the top problem facing the country surged from 13% to 21% in less than a month.During the same period, three-quarters of GOP voters said illegal immigration was a major concern, compared to only 19% of Democratic-leaning voters.This is a good issue for the Republican base, says GOP strategist David Winston.This is a promise he made to them in 2016, which is why hes coming back to it now.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now But theres likely another reason Trump is again pushing the immigration issue to center stage: forcing a national conversation about illegal immigration promises to leave Democrats flatfooted.Apart from supporting a path to citizenship, especially for young people brought to the country as minors, almost none of the Democrats currently running for president have offered anything akin to a comprehensive immigration plan.Only oneformer Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julin Castrohas published a detailed immigration proposal of any kind.Democrats are tongue-tied partly because an immigration plan that satisfies their base would likely includes a complex patchwork of legislation, department regulations and executive actions.That kind of reform is hard execute and even harder to explain to voters during a stump speech.Hire more immigration judges to adjudicate credible fear claims is harder to chant than Build that wall!Theyre gonna say they dont want to separate families, that they dont want to be as bad as Trump, because they want to be clear theyre not evil, says Jess Morales Rocketto, executive director of Care in Action, who helped organize the Families Belong Together marches last year.But they dont want to have a conversation about policy, because that will get into things that will alienate voters in Iowa and in South Carolina.By and large the overall feeling is that it is not helpful in gaining new votes.Castro stands out as the exception.His plan would make illegal immigration a civil offense rather than a criminal one, and promises to effectively end the use of detention and for-profit detention centers in immigration cases.Hes also proposed a 21st Century Marshall Plan to bolster economic development in Central America so that people have fewer reasons to flee to the U.S. Trump has made this a central issue in this campaign, says Jennifer Fiore, a senior advisor to Secretary Castro.So Secretary Castro is showing what a bold and progressive immigration plan looks like.Beyond that, Democratic candidates proposals have been piecemeal at best.Senator Kamala Harris recently introduced the American Dream Employment Act, which would allow young people who qualify under DACA to work in the Senate or House of Representatives, while Senator Kirsten Gillibrand has promised to fix our broken immigration system, but stops short of offering specifics on her campaign website.Several 2020 candidates have flirted with calls to Abolish ICE, a goal of many liberals.Last year, Gillibrand said she agreed with activists who called to abolish ICE, and that she wanted to to get rid of it, start over, reimagine it, and build something that actually works.Warren called for replacing ICE with something that reflects our values, and Harris said on MSNBC last year that we need to probably think about starting from scratch.But some of them have toned down this rhetoric as the primary ramps up.When asked about immigration at a January town hall, Gillibrand called the situation at the border inhumane and intolerable, but did not repeat her previous statement on abolishing ICE.In a recent campaign appearance in Iowa, Senator Bernie Sanders pushed for immigration reform but said he was not in favor of open borders, because theres a lot of poverty in this world, and youre going to have people from all over the world.And I dont think thats something that we can do at this point.Cant do it.One reason why these candidates may be backing off the leftwing rallying cry to Abolish ICE is that the broader public doesnt support the idea: a 2018 poll found that only 1 in 4 Americans favors eliminating the enforcement agency.But the debate over the future of U.S. immigration policy isnt necessarily all bad for Democrats, Some Democratic strategists believe the party will emerge with the upper hand, so long as they are able to train voters focus on the Presidents unpopular ideas.Hes proven over and over and again that every time he tries to enact one of his more egregious policies on immigration, he alienates Democrats, middle of the road voters, and he alienates Republicans, says Joel Benenson, a pollster who has advised Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.Hes shooting himself in the foot.Indeed, while Trumps immigration policies are popular among his hardcore base, moderate Republicans and swing voters tend to be more ambivalent.The Republican base is not large enough to actually deliver a majority coalition in 2020, warned Winston, the Republican strategist.Castros campaign is already putting money on that bet.They believe that images of young children separated from their immigrant families will be more alienating to moderates than endearing to Trumps base .If the president wants to make this a referendum on immigration, says Fiore, were making it a referendum on humanity.Write to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com.
President Trump's Sister Retires as Federal Judge, Ending Ethical Misconduct Inquiry:::::(NEW YORK) President Donald Trumps sister has retired as a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia, ending a civil misconduct inquiry launched after a report that she participated in Trump family schemes to dodge taxes.The retirement of Maryanne Trump Barry was revealed in an April 1 order signed by a top court official in New York, where the misconduct case was assigned to prevent conflicts of interest for judges who knew Barry.A judicial panel began the review in response to four citizen complaints filed in October after The New York Times published a story alleging the president and his siblings evaded inheritance taxes.The April 1 order said Barrys voluntary retirement ends the review stemming from claims based on the news article alleging that Barry may have committed misconduct relating to tax and financial transactions that occurred mostly in the 1980s and 1990s.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now Barry, 82, was not identified by name in the order, but the facts matched her circumstances.The order said the complaint process was meant to correct conditions interfering with the effective and expeditious administration of court business.It said the resignation meant that Barry can no longer perform any judicial duties and thus can no longer be investigated.Barry didnt respond to an email seeking comment.The 15,000-word Times report last year said that Trumps father, Fred, transferred ownership of most of his real estate empire to his four living children before he died in the late 1990s.The Times investigation, based in part on more than 100,000 pages of financial documents including confidential tax returns from the father and his companies, concluded that the value of the properties was vastly understated when they were reported as $41.4 million.It said the properties were later sold over the next decade for over 16 times that amount.The Times reported Trumps parents transferred over $1 billion to their children.It said that the transfer should have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million, but that the children paid only about $52.2 million.Trump has called the Times expose a false hit piece.Scott Shuchart, an attorney who filed one of the complaints, said he was absolutely disappointed that Barry was able to end scrutiny of her actions by retiring.If the Times story is correct, then she participated in a decades-long multimillion-dollar tax fraud.That should be an impeachable offense.She gets her full salary, he said.I think its appalling that were continuing to pay this criminal and that she now has completely avoided consequence, Shuchart added.Its ridiculous.If members of the family did break any laws, the expiration of a statute of limitations makes a criminal prosecution unlikely, though lawsuits might be possible.With a recently approved retroactive pay raise for federal appellate judges, Barry will receive $223,700 annually in retirement.After her brothers election, Barry gave up her court staff and took inactive status in early 2017.A Republican, she was nominated for a judgeship by President Ronald Reagan and was elevated to the circuit court by President Bill Clinton.Contact us at editors@time.com.
Why the Charge Against Julian Assange Makes No Mention of Espionage or 2016 Russian Hacking:::::Wikileaks is at the center of major questions in Robert Muellers investigation, including whether anyone involved in Donald Trumps presidential campaign assisted the organization in releasing hacked materials.But the charge in the one-count indictment against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange unsealed on Thursday shortly after his arrest doesnt speak to those questions or broader First Amendment issues.In an indictment dated March 6, 2018, the United States charges Assange with one count of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion.The indictment alleges that in March 2010, Assange engaged in a conspiracy with Chelsea Manning, a former intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army, to assist Manning in cracking a password stored on U.S. Department of Defense computers connected to the Secret Internet Protocol Network, a U.S. government network used for classified documents and communications.Conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, which violates the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, is the meat and potatoes in the world of computer crime, says Paul Rosenzweig, who teaches at the George Washington University School of Law and was deputy assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.Almost everybody that you see whos charged with a computer fraud of some sort gets a charge thats somewhere like this.This fits with the typical prosecutorial strategy of charging someone with a smaller, more easily provable crime in what could be a larger criminal context.The conspiracy component of it can be pretty easy to prove, that there had to be some degree of coordination of efforts and action, says Thomas Holt, a professor in the School of Criminal Justice at Michigan State University who is an expert in computer hacking.So conspiracy is a way to treat it as low-hanging fruit where you can at least demonstrate through email and other communications that they were working in some degree in concert to produce an outcome.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now Limiting the indictment against Assange to this one, narrower charge and not charging him with espionage leaves aside any First Amendment questions that could have been raised about Wikileaks publishing classified material.There has been a lot of speculation that the U.S. would indict Assange merely for distributing classified material, former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti wrote on Twitter.You have heard a lot of concern about that, and it is justified.Many legitimate press publications in the U.S. distribute classified material at times.But this indictment does not charge Assange with a crime related merely to the publication of the material.Rosenzweig offers this analogy: If a journalist has sources offering classified documents, the journalist can publish those documents and this indictment against Assange has no bearing on that.But if a source tells a journalist there are documents behind a locked door, and the journalist offers to help pick the lock, thats when it becomes a crime.You as a journalist have become engaged in a criminal enterprise in a way thats different from normal journalist behavior, Rosenzweig says of that scenario.This is where relevance to Muellers Russia investigation comes in.In 2016, hackers that the U.S. government believes to have been directed by the Russian government hacked the Democratic National Committee and Clintons campaign chairman John Podesta.Batches of the hacked emails were released by Wikileaks.Mueller indicted Russian intelligence officers for crimes related to this operation, but he did not charge Assange.There are two key relevant questions in Muellers investigation.The first is how the hacked material made its way from Russias Internet Research Agency to Wikileaks, and whether Trump advisor Roger Stone or anyone else associated with the campaign was in that chain of custody.The second, related question is whether Stone or anyone else in the campaign assisted in targeting the hacking or selecting and timing the release of hacked material.(Stone has been charged with lying to Congress and obstructing an investigation into his communications with Assange.Former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen also testified that he was present for a July 2016 phone call during which Stone informed Trump that Assange was planning to publish hacked Democratic emails.)As in Rosenzweigs analogy, if Stone or another member of the campaign simply knew about the information in advance, that likely wouldnt be a crime.But if they conspired in the hack, that could be.Attorney General William Barr has said Muellers investigation did not establish that anyone on the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the election.For now, this single-count indictment against Assange for activity from nine years ago doesnt seem to have direct bearing on lingering questions from the Mueller investigation.And Mueller hasnt recommended any more charges to come directly from his office.But Assange and Wikileaks loom over multiple aspects of Muellers investigation, and more details may surface in the coming days when Barr releases a redacted version of the report.-With additional reporting by

Tim Ryan Is Trying to Break Through in the 2020 Field With a Midwestern Message:::::You may have heard of Tim Ryans cousin.Sitting on a barstool in an office-park brewery in West Des Moines, Iowa, Ryan tells the tale of how cousin Donny called him up two decades ago, shell-shocked and soon to be out of a job at the electrical-parts factory where hed worked for seven years.The last thing Donny did was box up the equipment hed been running to ship it to China, along with his job.Its an anecdote that Ryan deploys often.Its also one that could have come from the mouth of President Donald Trump, whom Ryan is now running against.An eight-term Democratic Congressman from a largely white, working-class part of Ohio, Ryan has just launched a presidential campaign built around the plight of the people Trump dubbed the forgotten men and women of America.And even a few years ago, the 45-year-old swing-state Congressman may have looked and sounded like a presidential candidate from central casting, a man following the path taken by eight Presidents from Ohio to the White House.But as the 2020 race gets under way, Ryan barely registers in the crowded Democratic presidential contest.The party is fielding its most diverse group of contenders in history, including firebrands, pioneers and coalition builders.In a race dominated so far by policy ideas like free college and breaking up monopolies, theres little sign of an opening for a little-known Midwestern Congressman who was against abortion rights until 2015 and has made rebuilding the partys connection with blue collar voters the centerpiece of his campaign.Most of the latest polls in Iowa and New Hampshire didnt even ask about Ryan, who faces a steep climb just to qualify for the first Democratic debates in June.But even as they dismiss Ryans chances, many Democrats say the party should heed his message.To win back the White House, they say, Democrats first need to win back workers who share the frustrations Ryan sees when hes out with his family.I could win Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin; rebuild the blue wall; and take out Trump, Ryan tells TIME.But thats not all.I dont want it to be just about beating Trump.Its got to be about totally forging a new politics in the country that realigns things.Its got to happen.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now Ryan admits that he is a long-shot contender.For me, its Iowa, New Hampshire, Ryan says, sipping a locally made pint of Foxy Blonde ale.I have to do really well.I dont know what that means in the field of 19 people.It used to be three tickets out of Iowa, and now maybe its, like, six?The Congressmans politics can be equally hard to interpret.Its easy to caricature a former NRA guy who has supported corporate-tax cuts and tried twice to dethrone House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for being out of step with todays Democratic Party.But Ryan is no centrist.He may not be for the Green New Deal as it stands, but wants to partner with the private sector to develop new environmentally friendly technologies to replace a vanishing manufacturing sector.Hes a self-described progressive, but one who doesnt sign on to far-left ideas like abolishing ICE or the Electoral College.And hes a yoga and meditation devotee who wrote a book on the practice of mindfulness and another on food policy.Ryan grew up in Niles, Ohio, a small city on the outskirts of the once mighty industrial hub of Youngstown.He and his brothers were altar boys at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Church, where his priest celebrated a private mass for Ryans family and close friends just hours before Ryan delivered his announcement speech on April 6.The priest played to the choir with his sermon, telling the clan to hold out hope for Ryans candidacy.After all, the priest said, the Pharisees doubted that someone from Galilee could be a prophet, let alone found Christianity.It was the best homily, Ryan chuckles.A President from Niles?Come on.(Ryan is in on the joke; President William McKinley was born there, and the Congressman launched his original House campaign from the McKinley presidential museum.)In a party marked by rising secularism, Ryan remains devout.To me, my faith is about love and compassion, he says.A standout high school quarterback, Ryan was recruited to play at Youngstown State.A knee injury when he was 19 sidelined him and sent him studying political science at Bowling Green.Between stints working for his local Congressman, the troublemaking James Traficant, and a term in the state Senate, he earned a law degree.In 2002, after Traficant was indicted for bribery, racketeering and tax evasion, Ryan, then 29, ran for his former bosss job and won, making him the youngest Congressman in the country at the time.(Though Traficant was expelled from the House, he still got 15% of the vote in 2002 as a jailhouse candidate and 16% in 2010.)The district is now among the poorest in the U.S., and Ryan has used his perch on the powerful House Appropriations committee to bring home millions of dollars in grants.Ryan has long mused about running for higher office.Whether he can compete with a host of better-known and more dynamic competitors is a different question.At a moment when rivals like Elizabeth Warren are rolling out well-formed policy proposals honed with input from think tanks and networks of advisers, Ryan is serving as his own policy chief.He lacks the online fundraising army that has powered candidates like Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg.Nor does he have the big-dollar backing of contenders like Joe Biden and Cory Booker.The reality of his candidacy comes through as a kind of humility bordering on fatalism.Before sitting down for a beer with TIME, Ryan fielded questions from potential Iowa caucusgoers gathered on the brewerys concrete floor.This will not be easy, Ryan told his crowd.Im not a superstar.Im not a savior.I will tell you I will jump in the foxhole with you, and we will get this done.We are smart enough, we are creative enough, we are courageous enough, to pull this off.But it will be a long slog.Few Democratic observers believe Ryan has a chance of emerging as the nominee.But there is evidence that his peers should be listening to his pitch.For all the energy on the partys left flank, the Democrats path back to the House majority ran through the Midwest in 2018, driven in large part by suburban women who have soured on Trumps bravado.Many Democrats are eager for presidential candidates who promise big changes, but plenty of voters in the heartland simply want to believe politics can be practiced across the aisle, as Ryan has shown in working with GOP colleagues on defending Ohio military bases and fighting Great Lakes pollution.Cousin Donny is hardly the only person in this part of the country to have been affected by the economic upheaval of the past decades.In fact, Ryan says it was another family members call that spurred him to seriously consider a White House run.In November of last year, his stepdaughter Bella called in tears.Her friends father was soon to lose his job, she said, when the local General Motors plant closed its doors.Ryan was reduced to tears tooIt was brutal, he recallsand sparked to action.Write to Philip Elliott at philip.elliott@time.com.This appears in the April 22, 2019 issue of TIME.
President Trump Faces Tough Decision on North Korea at White House Today:::::President Donald Trump will face a difficult, potentially dangerous, decision when he meets with South Korean president Moon Jae-In at the White House today, three U.S. officials familiar with the matter tell TIME.The U.S. intelligence community has advised the White House that Moon will ask Trump to ease some of the economic sanctions imposed on North Korea for its rogue nuclear and missile programs, the officials say.If Trump says Yes, that could help restart diplomatic talks that have stalled since his failed Hanoi summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un last February.But even a modest concession on sanctions could solidify Pyongyangs status as a nuclear weapons power, leaving U.S. allies in northeast Asia vulnerable and potentially launching a regional arms race.Trump could avoid that outcome by saying No to Moons request.But that risks a return to the saber rattling, or worse, that marked the early days of Trumps tenure, when fears of war with North Korea spiked.Kim recently signaled his readiness to return to confrontation, despite Trumps public assertions that the two leaders are good friends.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now The Catch-22 is the result of bad diplomacy by both Trump and Kim, the U.S. officials say.Trump continues to believe that a combination of personal diplomacy and economic pressure will eventually get Kim to abandon his nuclear arsenal, the officials say.Trump is still ignoring the unanimous assessment of intelligence, defense and State Department officials that Kim never will.Kim, for his part, remains wedded to the idea that Trump will accept an agreement that implicitly concedes North Koreas nuclear status in exchange for a formal end to the Korean War after 66 years.Trump, Kim is betting, cares more about claiming credit for a diplomatic win than actually solving the problem of a nuclear North Korea.Kim may be right.Even without a deal, Trump has taken a few small steps in Moons direction, including last month calling off two major joint military exercises with U.S. and South Korean forces.Trump also has claimed that he has eliminated the nuclear threat from Pyongyang.That claim that has fallen on deaf ears in Tokyo, Seoul, and U.S. forces in Northeast Asia, all of whom lie within range of a potential missile strike from North Korea.Administration hawks worry that giving North Korea even symbolic sanctions relief now would remove some of the diplomatic pressure on Russia and China to crack down on Pyongyang.China reportedly just opened a new bridge to North Korea.However, continuing to demand that Kim has to eat his meat before he can have any pudding, as Trump did at his summit with Kim in Hanoi, risks North Korea launching its response from the Sohae Satellite Launching Ground and ending its moratorium on missile testing, as Kim has threatened to do.That, in turn, could escalate tensions, sparking a return to Trump threats of military action and an end to the Norths moratorium on nuclear and missile testing.Japan, whose relationship with South Korea remains troubled and whose confidence in the U.S. has been shaken by Trumps transactional approach to international alliances, moved on Tuesday to extend its sanctions on North Korea for another two years.There may be a way out for Trump, the U.S. officials say: punt the problem to Moon.The South Korean leader has staked his presidency on mending fences with the North.Saying neither yes nor nothat is, stallingcould buy time for Moon to cook up an interim deal that saves face for both Trump and Kim.Even that option isnt a solution to the problem, however.Handing the radioactive hot potato to Moon might result in better relations on the Korean Peninsula in the medium term, but it is unlikely to address the longer-term challenges that come from North Koreas nuclear and conventional threats.But at least, the U.S. officials say, punting to Moon would be better than conceding a nuclear North Korea, or threatening war to prevent it.Contact us at editors@time.com.
Treasury Secretary Delays Decision on Providing President Trump's Tax Returns:::::WASHINGTON (AP) Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says the department hasnt decided whether to comply with a demand by a key House Democrat to deliver President Donald Trumps tax returns and wont meet a Wednesday deadline to provide them.In a letter to House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., who asked for Trumps returns a week ago, Mnuchin said Treasury will consult with the Justice Department and carefully review the request further.The legal implications of this request could affect protections for all Americans against politically-motivated disclosures of personal tax information, regardless of which party is in power, Mnuchin wrote.He said Treasury respects lawmakers oversight duties and would make sure taxpayer protections would be scrupulously observed, consistent with my statutory responsibilities as the department reviews the request.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now Earlier Wednesday, Trump weighed in, telling reporters that he wont agree to release his returns while he is under audit.Trump said, I would love to give them, but Im not going to do it while Im under audit.The IRS says theres no rule against subjects of an audit from publicly releasing their tax filings.Neal asked the IRS last Wednesday to turn over six years of the presidents tax returns within a week.Trump has broken with decades of presidential precedent by not voluntarily releasing his returns to the public.Trumps position has long been that he is under audit and therefore could not release his returns.But in recent weeks, he has added to the argument, saying publicly and privately that the American people elected him without seeing his taxes and would do so again.Remember, I got elected last time the same exact issue, Trump said.Frankly, the people dont care.The president has told those close to him that the attempt to get his returns were an invasion of his privacy and a further example of the Democratic-led witch hunt which he has called special counsel Robert Muellers investigation meant to damage him.Trump has repeatedly asked aides about the status of the House request and has inquired about the loyalty of the top officials at the IRS, according to one outside adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Democrats didnt expect the department to comply, but they havent sketched out their next steps.Rep. Dan Kildee, D-Mich., speaking before Mnuchins response was delivered, said it may take Neal a couple of days to issue his own response.House Democrats are at a party retreat in the Virginia suburbs of Washington.Neal has adopted a methodical approach to seeking Trumps returns.He has the option of eventually seeking to subpoena the records or to go to court if Treasury does not comply, but its not clear hell adopt a more confrontational approach just yet.Neals initial letter, sent a week ago, didnt lay out any consequences for the IRS if it didnt comply, and a spokesman said a likely course would be a second, more insistent, letter.We intend to follow through with this, Neal said Wednesday.Ill let you know fast.The request for Trumps tax filings is but one of many oversight efforts launched by Democrats after taking back the House in last falls midterms.Neal is relying on a 1920s-era law that says the IRS shall furnish any tax return requested by the chairmen of key House and Senate committees.Mnuchin told lawmakers that his department will follow the law, but he hasnt shared the departments interpretation of the statute.The White House did not respond to questions as to whether the president asked Mnuchin or the IRS head to intervene.The presidents outside attorney also did not respond to a request for comment.Contact us at editors@time.com.
Speaker Pelosi Says She Doesn't Trust Attorney General Barr: 'I Trust Mueller':::::WASHINGTON House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday she doesnt trust Attorney General William Barr and suggested his statement that he believes President Donald Trumps campaign was spied on undermines Barrs independence as the nations top law enforcement officer.The California Democrat said in an interview with The Associated Press she was very concerned about Barrs handling of special counsel Robert Muellers Trump-Russia investigation report and accused Barr doing Trumps political bidding.He is not the attorney general of Donald Trump.He is the attorney general of the United States, Pelosi told AP.I dont trust Barr, I trust Mueller.Barr testified Wednesday before a Senate panel that he believes spying did occur on Trumps 2016 presidential campaign, aligning himself more closely with the presidents views on the origins of the Russia investigation.Critics of the Russia probe note that it was launched during the Obama administration, though Mueller was appointed special counsel by Trumps Justice Department.Pelosi said Barrs comments undermine the Constitution and his role in the Justice Department.Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec declined to comment.Barr said Wednesday he expects to release a redacted version of the Mueller report next week, but Pelosi said its only a matter of time before the full report is made public.We will see it, she said.As House Democrats pursue oversight of the Trump administration beyond the Mueller probe, Trump has complained that Democrats will never be satisfied.He and his allies call it presidential harassment.Asked what would satisfy Democrats, Pelosi said: Ill be satisfied when we have a new president of the United States who is a Democrat.While some Democrats support pursuing impeachment proceedings against the president, however, Pelosi has kept them at a distance.She recently brushed off impeachment calls, saying Trumps just not worth it.But that was before Barr released his four-page analysis of Muellers report, which said the president was not exonerated by the special counsel.Mueller left open the question of whether Trump obstructed justice during the two-year probe of Russian interference in the 2016 election.Barr and his team at the Justice Department made their own decision to clear the president of criminal wrongdoing.Asked if she still thought Trump was not worth impeachment, Pelosi said to wait and see the full report.My view is that impeachment is very divisive in the country, and when we see what we need to see it may be imperative that he be impeached.But up until then, hes not worth it, Pelosi said.She said again, Let us see the report.As the new Congress rounds out its first 100 days, the speaker said Democrats are doing far more than conducting oversight of the White House, even though she said thats their constitutional responsibility as an equal branch of government.She said she prefers to keep the House focused on pocketbook issues for everyday Americans lowering health care costs and investing in infrastructure and new ethics rules.We are not just focusing on him, she said.Were focused on what we said we would do.Contact us at editors@time.com.
Acting ICE Head Quits as Trump Calls for 'Tougher' Nominee in Continuing Homeland Security Shakeup:::::The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement quit Wednesday, the latest departure among top immigration officials as President Donald Trump calls for tougher border control.The announcement came after Trump told reporters last week that he was pulling his nomination of acting ICE chief Ronald Vitiello for the directors job, saying he wanted to go in a different direction with someone tougher.Vitiello, who served for more than 30 years with Customs and Border protection before joining ICE, has protected our homeland with courage and conviction, said outgoing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen in a statement.The departure comes after Trump forced out Nielsen on Sunday and the acting deputy secretary of DHS resigned on Tuesday.Trump is increasingly frustrated by a spike in illegal border crossings, and last month empowered a hard-line aide, Stephen Miller, to have greater authority over immigration policy within the White House.More than 66,000 people were apprehended after crossing the border illegally in February, about a 38 percent increase from the month before.Most were families or children traveling alone.Contact us at editors@time.com.
Russia Targeted Sanders Supporters to Push Trump:::::Russia targeted supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., following his primary loss in 2016, hoping to push them towards voting for President Donald Trump instead of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, The Washington Post reports.Shortly after Sanders ended his primary campaign, a Twitter account called Red Louisiana News began focusing on the senators supporters.Conscious Bernie Sanders supporters already moving towards the best candidate Trump!#Feel the Bern #Vote Trump 2016, read one tweet from the account, according to the Post.Clemson University researchers found that this Twitter account was not based in Louisiana, as it claimed, but from Russia.Special counsel Robert Mueller found in his investigation that Russians at the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg were directed to use social media accounts to oppose Clinton and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.Researchers found that although its impossible to tell for sure how many social media posts were made targeting Sanders supporters, at least 9,000 of these Russian tweets included the word Bernie.I think there is no question that Sanders was central to their strategy.He was clearly used as a mechanism to decrease voter turnout for Hillary Clinton, said Darren Linvill, an associate professor of communications at Clemson and one of the researchers.He added that the tweets they examined give us a much clearer understanding of the tactics they were using.It was certainly a higher volume than people thought.
Julián Castro: Require WH Candidates to Release Tax Returns:::::Democratic presidential candidate, Julin Castro, said all those running for president should be required to release their tax returns.Castro, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary made his comments on Thursday during a CNN town hall.A video excerpt was posted on the CNN Twitter account.I support making it a requirement by statute -- Congress passing a law that requires people who are running for president to submit 10 years of their tax returns, he said.Castro, who said he would release 10 years of his tax returns in the next few weeks, blasted President Donald Trumps refusal to release his own.It is astonishing that this president still has not released his taxes Castro said.Its clear that he has something to hide, I dont.If you have nothing to hide than there could be no problem His comments come as Democrats continued to pressure Trump to provide his tax returns.
Dem Candidate Yang: Americans Should Benefit From Big Tech:::::Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang Friday argued for his call to give each American $1,000 a year, and said he disagrees with other Democratic hopefuls who are calling for an end to the Electoral College."You have to look up who are going the biggest winners from artificial intelligence and self-driving cars and trucks and new technologies," Yang, an entrepreneur and founder of Venture for America, told Fox News' "Fox and Friends.""Amazon, Google, Facebook and Uber, the American public sees very little in the innovation.Amazon literally paid zero in federal taxes."Meanwhile, Amazon fulfillment centers now have "more robots than people," Yang said.Show co-host Steve Doocy commented that a universal basic income hasn't worked in other places, but Yang disagreed."You don't even need to look across the globe," he said."All you have to do is look at Alaska which has had a petroleum dividend for almost 40 years and its wildly popular.It has created thousands of jobs."Yang also discussed calls to eliminate the Electoral College, saying he doesn't even know why that is being discussed."It has been part of our laws for decades," he said."It would require a constitutional amendment to change the Electoral College...do we want candidates just campaigning in major media markets and big cities?The constitutional framers were very wise.I will say as a Democrat it's very, very bad form to look like you are changing the rules when you have been losing by rules that everyone agreed on for decades."
Trump on Dem Proposal for Spending Hike: 'It's Not Happening':::::President Donald Trump is downplaying the chances of reaching a bipartisan two-year agreement to escape billions of dollars in spending reductions.The president tweeted Thursday evening: House Democrats want to negotiate a $2 TRILLION spending increase but cant even pass their own plan.We cant afford it anyway, and its not happening!Politico noted House Democrats failed this week to gain support to pass a bill that would ward off $126 billion in spending cuts in the fiscal that starts on October 1 and cuts for the following fiscal year.The Trump administration maintains it would lead to nearly $2 trillion in spending increases over 10 years, according to Politico.Meanwhile, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned that Trump might initiate a budget sequester and allow about $125 billion in cuts for both defense and non-defense spending if Congress does not agree to his 2020 budget.
McConnell Won't Say If Senate Would Back Herman Cain for Fed:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is declining to say whether he thinks his chamber would confirm Herman Cain to join the Federal Reserve board, casting doubt on the former Republican presidential candidate's prospects should President Donald Trump advance him for the post.Asked Thursday if a Cain nomination would face problems , McConnell, R-Ky., noted that successful nominees must pass background checks and have a likelihood of confirmation."And, as you know, some of my members have expressed concern about that nomination," McConnell told reporters."But as far as I know, it hasn't been made yet."Trump's interest in potentially nominating Cain along with another political ally, conservative commentator Stephen Moore , has sparked questions among lawmakers from both parties in Congress about the president's influence on the central bank.Fed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated the importance of the Fed's independence during a talk Thursday evening with House Democrats meeting in Virginia for their annual issues retreat, according to a source in the room unauthorized to discuss the private session.Powell told lawmakers that he saw his role as totally apolitical.He also said the Fed does not consider political pressure in its decision making, the source said.Another source in the room confirmed the remarks.The chairman fielded questions from lawmakers during a question-and-answer session in Lansdowne, but declined to comment on the president's potential picks.Powell was Trump's choice to lead the Fed, but the president has been critical of him for raising interest rates.Earlier Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said elevating Cain and Moore to the Fed would risk politicizing the nation's central bank and endangering the economy."These two appointments to the Fed are the worst, ill-suited appointment that the president could come up with," she told reporters.Three GOP senators Utah's Mitt Romney, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski and North Dakota's Kevin Cramer told The Associated Press they'd likely vote against Cain.With Republicans controlling the Senate 53-47, it would take opposition from just four GOP senators to sink the nomination, assuming all Democrats are also "no" votes.As he did earlier this week, McConnell also sidestepped a question about whether he would back Cain or Moore, a Fed critic and former Trump campaign aide, for the board.Trump has said he will nominate both men."We'll see who's actually nominated," said McConnell.Cain has run into concerns by lawmakers from both parties that, as a Trump loyalist and deeply conservative political figure, he would threaten the Fed's traditional political independence.Trump himself has taken a nontraditional approach to the Fed, repeatedly accusing it of mismanaging the economy by not pushing hard enough for low interest rates.The White House offered no fresh comment Thursday about Trump's intentions, referring reporters to his earlier comments about Cain.Trump initially called Cain "a very terrific man" who would "do very well there."But he said earlier this week that he didn't know how Cain was faring in the vetting process and that Cain "will make that determination" whether to continue.Cain, former CEO of Godfather's Pizza, ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.He dropped out of the race after allegations of sexual harassment and infidelity, which he denied.Last year, in September, he helped found a pro-Trump super political action committee, America Fighting Back PAC, whose website says, "We must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment."Cain formerly served on the board of the Fed's Kansas City regional bank.He has also called for a return to the gold standard to control inflation, which most economists consider unworkable.Moore is a conservative commentator and another Trump political ally.
ABC: Herman Cain to Abandon Fed Reserve Nomination:::::Facing a steep uphill battle in the Senate, Herman Cain is expected to withdraw from a possible post on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, according to a new report.ABC News reported Thursday evening Cain will make his decision known in the coming days.Cain ran for president in 2012 and served as chair of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City from 1995-1996.He also worked as the chairman and CEO of Godfather's Pizza from 1986-1996.Democrats and even some Republicans have questioned Cain's qualifications to serve on the Federal Reserve Board.Earlier Thursday, a fourth Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. said he would not vote for Cain.Without any votes from Democrats and independents, Cain's nomination would fall short in the Senate.Sens.Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Cory Gardner, R-Colo., were also opposed to Cain serving in the role.President Donald Trump has not officially nominated Cain, but he was planning to.
Report: Medicare for All Will Boot 181M Off Private Coverage:::::The new Medicare For All bill introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., would kick 181 million Americans off their existing private healthcare coverage, according to The Daily Signal.In a breakdown of the bill, The Daily Signal reported the legislation would create a new national health insurance plan to provide universal coverage to all U.S. residents, regardless of their legal status, and be phased in over four years.But, under Section 107, the Daily Signal reported the bill would outlaw private health coverage, including employer-sponsored coverage, that "duplicates" the coverage provided under the government health plan.The Daily Signal reported that would mean about 181 million Americans would lose their existing private coverage.It would also abolish other federal health programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, the Childrens Health Insurance Program, Tricare, and tthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program programs that cover tens of millions of Americans and absorb them into the larger program.According to The Daily Signal, the consequences of the bill will be slower care, fewer available doctors and new taxation.
WH Floated Idea of Releasing Migrants Into Sanctuary Cities:::::The White House floated an idea with immigration officials in recent months that would have involved arresting illegal immigrants at the southern border and then busing them to sanctuary cities to send a political message to Democrats.The Washington Post reported Thursday the proposal began in a White House email last November.The idea was raised again in February as another migrant caravan was heading to the United States.San Francisco, a high-profile sanctuary city and which is represented by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was among the areas targeted in the proposal.Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ultimately shot down the idea.The White House said the proposal was designed to both send a political message to opponents of how President Donald Trump is handling immigration and also to free up space in jails near the border.In a statement to the Post, the White House said, "This was just a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion."Pelosi's office was furious."The extent of this administration's cynicism and cruelty cannot be overstated," spokesperson Ashley Etienne told the Post."Using human beings including little children as pawns in their warped game to perpetuate fear and demonize immigrants is despicable."Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that do not enforce federal immigration laws and do not help ICE officials or agents.The Trump administration has threatened to withhold federal funding to cities and states that do not comply with ICE directives.It was reported this week, meanwhile, White House officials are pushing a plan to have Border Patrol agents question asylum seekers to see if the migrants are truly in need of a safe haven.
Sen. Harris a Gun Owner Who Wants Stronger Gun Laws:::::Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., revealed Thursday she is a gun owner but said she still wants stricter gun laws."I am a gun owner and I own a gun for probably the reason that a lot of people do, for personal safety," the 2020 presidential primary contender told reporters in Iowa, the New York Post reported."I was a former prosecutor."A Harris campaign aide said the weapon she owns is a handgun, which she keeps locked up, CNN reported.The aide told the news outlet that Harris bought the gun years ago.Harris discussed her gun history after meeting supporters at a house party in Des Moines including members of Moms Demand Action For Gun Sense in America, the grassroots movement that is part of Everytown for Gun Safety, the largest gun control advocacy group in the country, CNN reported."For too long, and still today, we are being offered a false choice which suggests you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's gun away," Harris said, attributing the problem to a "lack of courage" from leaders.Harris called gun violence a "clear problem in our country" and pushed for "smart gun safety laws which include universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapons ban.Period," she said, the Post reported.At a January CNN town hall, shortly after declaring her candidacy, Harris said Congress would have acted after 20 children and six adults were murdered Dec. 14, 2012, at Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School if lawmakers had been placed in a locked room without press and required to examine "the autopsy photographs of those babies," CNN reported."And then you can vote your conscience.This has become a political issue," she said.
Dems Try to Steer 2020 Race to the Middle:::::Moderate Democrats are pushing back against popular far-left proposals like the Green New Deal, Medicare-for-all and liberal tax plans fearing they will backfire in the 2020 election.The centrists' move has been strengthened by the entrance into the White House race of moderate presidential candidates like former Colorado Gov.John Hickenlooper, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, and the expected announcements of former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., The Washington Post reported.Because of that, the policies now taking center stage are public options or marginal Medicare expansions, market-based solutions to climate change, closing tax loopholes, and expanding tax breaks for the middle class, the Post reported."There was a clear story coming out of the midterms, and it is like it never happened," Jane Hartley, a former U.S. ambassador to France who helped raise millions to support 31 Democratic House candidates, told the Post."We have to look at how we won.The Democrats have to put together a coalition, and it's a coalition that includes suburban voters."President Donald Trump has already suggested he will capitalize on the prominence of the Democrats' progressive policy ideas."If they beat me with the Green New Deal, I deserve to lose," Trump said at a recent fundraiser for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the Post reported."What they want to do to the country would be horrible.We have to win."Biden's probable entrance into the race could offer the strongest counterweight to the liberal surge, the Post reported."Show me the really left-left-left-left-wingers who beat a Republican," he said last week, the Post reported."The fact of the matter is the vast majority of the members of the Democratic Party are still basically liberal-moderate Democrats in the traditional sense."Larry Summers, who served as treasury secretary under President Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser in the Obama administration, told the Post the Democratic Party has been down a radical path before to no good end."There is a bit in the air that is worryingly reminiscent of 1972, when Democrats were rightly enraged with a corrupt and malign president were disillusioned by their previous unsuccessful establishment presidential candidate, gravitated to radical redistribution economic policy, focused on turning out their activists, and failed to focus on the middle," Summers told the Post."The result was the political catastrophe of Richard Nixon's re-election."
Gabbard: Assange Arrest Troublesome for US, Journalists:::::The arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is troublesome for journalists and Americans, 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Tulsi Gabbard said Thursday on CNN.Assange was dragged out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London early Thursday after Ecuador revoked his diplomatic asylum."I think what's happening here is, unfortunately, it is some form of retaliation coming from the government saying, 'Hey, this is what happens when you release information that we don't want you to release,'" Rep. Gabbard, D-Hawaii told "The Lead.""And I think that's why this is such a dangerous and slippery slope, not only for journalists, not only for those in the media, but also for every American that our government can and has the power to kind of lay down the hammer to say, 'Be careful, be quiet, and fall in line, otherwise we have the means to come after you.'"Freshman Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., also expressed concern about Assange's arrest."To my knowledge, the specific charges that were raised for his extradition were even ones that the Obama administration entertained but turned down because it was kind of beyond the pale in terms of an attack on journalism and journalists," Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said, according to Fox News."So, I'm concerned by that specific aspect, very much so in this situation."
Susan Rice Says She Won't Challenge GOP Sen. Collins in 2020:::::Susan Rice, who served as national security adviser under President Barack Obama, won't be challenging Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine in 2020.Rice told former Obama administration official Alyssa Mastromonaco at the 10th annual Women in the World Summit on Thursday in New York that she loves Maine and that her family has deep roots in the state.But she said she decided with her family "that the timing really isn't right for us."Rice tantalized Democrats in October when she expressed interest in Collins' seat during the contentious confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.She said at the time that Collins "betrayed women across this country" by supporting Kavanaugh.Rice said during the event on Thursday that her daughter is going into her junior year of high school and that her family has already sacrificed for her."I've given this a lot of thought, and in the course of weighing it all, I've decided with my family that the timing really isn't right for us," she said.Her announcement could free other Democrats to enter the race.So far, no high-profile Democrat has announced a challenge to Collins next year.But the race is still early, and Collins herself hasn't formally announced she'll seek re-election.Collins' office had no immediate comment Thursday.Collins is a self-described centrist in an era of increasingly polarized politics.First elected to the Senate in 1996, she's now the last Republican member of Congress from New England.Rice's maternal grandparents emigrated from Jamaica to Maine in the 1910s.Her grandfather, David Augustus Dickson, worked as a shipper, porter and janitor.Rice's grandmother, Mary Dickson, a maid and seamstress, was named Maine State Mother of the Year in 1950.
McConnell Calls for Bipartisan Immigration Legislation:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday opened the door to addressing the nation's immigration problems through bipartisan legislation that he said should include changes to asylum law.Speaking to reporters before the start of a two-week Senate recess, McConnell noted the "crisis" at the southern border with Mexico and said, "I think it's long past due for us to sit down on a bipartisan basis and try to fix as much of this problem as we can."With the numbers of Central American migrants surging at the U.S.-Mexico border, President Donald Trump earlier this year declared a national emergency.That, he argued, would allow him to take federal funds and use them to build a wall to repel undocumented immigrants.He took the step after Congress refused to give him $5.7 billion for the construction.But McConnell said that bolstering border security would not fully address immigration ills."That doesn't solve the asylum issue.That can't be solved I don't think without some kind of statutory adjustment of some kind or another," McConnell said.Asked whether he has spoken to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer about working on a wide-ranging immigration bill, McConnell said, "Well yeah.We're talking about a variety of different things and we'll see what happens."Schumer aides were not immediately available for comment.Earlier in the day at a news conference, Schumer did not list immigration as one of the issues he thought could be addressed by the Senate this year.U.S. officers arrested or denied entry to over 103,000 people along the border with Mexico in March, a 35 percent increase over the prior month and more than twice as many as the same period last year, according to data released on Tuesday.'A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT AREA' The Trump administration and leading Senate Republicans have called for moving Central American asylum cases more quickly through the legal system and setting an easier standard for deportations.But toughening U.S. asylum law is likely to face stiff opposition from Democrats in Congress and from immigration advocacy groups.Democrat Chris Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee that oversees immigration policy, earlier this week said it was "unlikely" he would support such changes to asylum law."But I'm always willing to hear constructive ideas and proposals.That is a particularly difficult area," Coons said in a brief interview outside the Senate chamber.Asked what other immigration problems could be addressed in a bipartisan negotiation, McConnell did not specify saying, "That's what a negotiation produces, some kind of understanding of how many of these different issues you can get agreement to solve."At the top of Democrats' list is providing permanent legal protections from deportation for hundreds of thousands of "dreamers."They are undocumented immigrant youths who were brought to the United States when they were under the age of 18, many as infants or toddlers.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, also in hallway interviews this week, said he has asked the White House to provide detailed changes it would want in asylum legislation."They were supposed to get it to me last week.I don't know what has happened," said Graham, who has developed close ties to Trump.Gregory Chen, director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said that instead of toughening U.S. asylum law, Congress and the Trump administration should invest in more orderly screening of undocumented immigrants and improve infrastructure at ports of entry.Asked whether asylum law also needs to be changed, Chen said, "In a word, no.We already have very strict and narrow definitions" of who should qualify.Altering it in the way some Republicans are discussing, Chen said in a phone interview this week, could put migrant children in jeopardy if they are sent back to their native countries, some of which have the highest levels of violent crime in the world.
Cain's Possible Nomination for Fed in Peril as Republican Opposition Mounts:::::The expected nomination of businessman Herman Cain to the Federal Reserve appeared in jeopardy on Thursday as another Republican voiced opposition, possibly denying Cain the support needed in the Senate to be confirmed in the post."If I had to vote today, I would vote no," Senator Kevin Cramer said in a statement.Cramer becomes the fourth Republican senator reported to be opposed to Cain's expected nomination by President Donald Trump.If all of the Senate's Democrats and the two independents aligned with them were to vote against Cain, he would fall short of the majority support he would need.
Dingell: Dems Spending 'Lot of Energy' on Unlikely Impeachment:::::Some Democrats are spending a "lot of energy" on impeachment when it is "very unlikely" to happen when they should instead focus on reforming healthcare, Rep. Debbie Dingell said Thursday."I think an impeachment would divide this country if we were not done it a bipartisan basis," the Michigan Democrat told Fox News' "Outnumbered Overtime.""I think everybody loves to speculate about this, but the fact of the matter is that I am focused on working an agenda for the people and that Republicans and Democrats need to worry about delivering for the American people on prescription drugs and infrastructure."She further refused to speculate on special counsel Robert Mueller's report, before it has been released."I will not engage in parsing words on a report I have not seen," Dingell said."None of us have seen it.We don't know what's in it.We've had a lot of people make assumptions on both sides."Dingell said she's also focused on trade, as "we need a level playing field for our workers."Meanwhile, Dingell said she's co-chairing the Medicare for All caucus because she thinks all Americans have the right to affordable, quality healthcare "so that if they are sick they don't worry about going to the doctor."Trump also needs to concentrate on healthcare reform before the 2020 election, not after, said Dingell."Isn't it about time that every person that lives in this country, if they are sick, doesn't have to worry about if they have cancer, whether it's worth having a mammogram because they can't get the treatment?"she said.
Barrasso: Barr 'Right Attorney General' to Probe Campaign Spying:::::Attorney General William Barr's comment that he believes spying took place on President Donald Trump's campaign was "very disturbing," Sen. John Barrasso said Thursday, but he thinks Barr is the right attorney general to look into it."The question is, was it unauthorized or authorized?"the Wyoming Republican told Fox News' "America's Newsroom.""Did obstruction of justice occur?Was it authorized?Who authorized it?The American public has a right to know what happened and I think we have the right attorney general to look into it now so we'll all know the truth."Barr later called the actions an investigative collection, but Barrasso said there is no difference between the two."Of course the Democrats were upset," said Barrasso."They've been upset since the day Donald Trump got elected president and did everything they could to help Hillary Clinton win.Now it looks like some of the things that may have occurred could have been illegal, unauthorized and we need to pursue it."Barrasso also discussed Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and his call for Medicaid for all, after the Democratic presidential candidate introduced legislation in the Senate for his healthcare push."Unfortunately he wants to do it with a complete government takeover of healthcare with the high cost associated with that and the loss of freedom for American citizens and the longer lines for people," said Barrasso."The first thing he wants to do is take a wrecking ball to the 180 million Americans who get their insurance through work, private insurance.Many of those people like the insurance that we have."
Dem Rep. Swalwell Defends Calling Trump 'Agent of Russia':::::Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., on Thursday defended his past comment President Donald Trump is an "agent of Russia," saying, "if he wasn't taking orders, he would release the report" special counsel Robert Mueller submitted.MSNBC anchor Willie Geist reminded Swalwell, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, of his remark during an interview on "Morning Joe" on Thursday."You said even in January on MSNBC when you were asked by Chris Matthews if the president is an agent of Russia, you said 'yes,'" and noted the president "will undoubtedly" claim the congressman was "way out there on the question of his campaign's relationship by Russia" in an attempt to discredit his campaign."Do you regret saying that?"Geist then asked."Or you do you still believe President Trump is still an agent of Russia?What do you mean by that?"Swalwell answered Trump "acts on their behalf, he too often puts their interests, too often, ahead of our own interests," and attempted to discuss another topic before eventually giving a more detailed response."If he wasn't taking orders, he wouldn't take the interpreter's note," Swalwell said."If he wasn't taking orders, he would release the report that said he's 100 percent exonerated with and so why does he act so suspiciously with Russia in ways he doesn't act with Theresa May or [France President Emmanuel] Macron or [Canada Prime Minister Justin] Trudeau?"All of my experience as a prosecutor tells me something's wrong with the way he's acting, the way that he's lying and that we should all be concerned about it."
Brandon Judd: Media 'Romanticize' Illegals, 'Vilify Good Guys':::::The pro-migration and pro-illegal immigration media is complicit in the U.S. border crisis as they "romanticize" illegal crossings and "vilify the good guys" trying to maintain law and order at the border, according to National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd."We always worried about how the media's going to react," Brandon Judd told Fox News' "Fox & Friends.""It's so frustrating and disappointing to see that border patrol agents are vilified for strictly enforcing the laws that Congress put in place."We're trying to protect the American public; yet, they romanticize those people crossing the border illegally and they vilify the good guys that are trying to do the job for the American public."Judd then added a call for Congress "to step up and do their job" on immigration reform, otherwise the Trump administration is forced to exercise its authority to "do what they need to do to alleviate this pressure" of massive migration at the border.While the media might paint the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen as a negative, it is a move in a positive direction for the administration, according to Judd."It's absolutely for the better," Judd said."If you look at Secretary Nielsen, she is second to none in cybersecurity.That's where her expertise lies.Unfortunately, she did not have that experience in border security."So, we elevated the commissioner of customs and border protection who had a career at CBP with border security to face the problems that the DHS is looking at in the face right now and that is border security."
Scalise: USMCA Will Be Approved Because It's a 'Better Deal':::::The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement will ultimately be approved because it is a better deal for American workers and jobs, House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., said Thursday."The president is negotiating with the Democrats in the House to get a plan for how they're going to move forward with it," Scalise told Fox Business' "Mornings With Maria.""I think in the end they will come to some agreement because it makes sense for everybody to get this passed so we have a better NAFTA 2.0."President Donald Trump has said if the USMCA was not approved, he would go back to pre-NAFTA, and Scalise said Thursday it was a positive sign when an agreement was reached with Mexico."Canada was a little more reluctant because they had a much better deal," Scalise said."They closed a lot of markets off to American products that we opened up in the new agreement."Scalise also called Wednesday's presidential executive order making it more difficult to block pipeline construction a "really big deal" for the energy industry."If you look in the Northeast especially, we are producing so much energy in America now that we are exporting we could be one of the world's leading exporters," said Scalise, noting there are parts of potential sites in the Northeast that are cut off because they do not have access to pipelines."That'll be a great advancement for American energy, so we cannot only export to the world but heat our ourselves for a lower cost," Scalise said."What's important is it lowers rates and helps ratepayers."
Congress To See Ex-WH Official Accused in Security Scandal:::::A former White House official who was accused of overturning security clearances for people who were found to have serious disqualifying issues will appear before the House Oversight Committee on April 23, The Washington Post reports.Carl Kline, the former White House personnel security director, will testify as part of the panels investigation into security clearances in President Donald Trumps White House.A whistleblower in his office accused him of granting security clearances to people that she and some of her fellow employees had found issue with.I regret the circumstances that have resulted in the committee on Oversight and Reform electing to subpoena Carl Kline, despite our legitimate offer to have him appear voluntarily, Klines lawyer, Robert N. Driscoll, wrote in a letter to the committee.Tricia Newbold, the whistleblower, told the committee last March that Kline overruled several clearance-denial recommendations, including a clearance application from White House adviser Jared Kushner, and subsequently retaliated when she complained.By corollary, it is not Mr. Klines role to comment on the strength of any such assertions, but to comply with instructions from the White House regarding appropriate scope of testimony, Driscoll wrote.I fully understand you may not see things the same way, but it is my sincere hope that we can avoid a harmful and costly inter-branch dispute that has a 40-plus year public servant and military veteran hanging in the balance.
White House Considered Busing Migrants to 'Sanctuary Cities':::::Trump administration officials sought to bus detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities as a way to retaliate against the president's adversaries, officials said Thursday.Pete Suratos reports.Trump administration officials sought to bus detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities as a way to retaliate against the president's adversaries, officials said Thursday, NBC News reported.The Washington Post, which first reported the proposals, said lawyers for Immigration and Customs Enforcement rejected the idea as inappropriate.The newspaper cited email messages it had reviewed and interviews with officials of the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS.DHS confirmed the broad outlines of the report Thursday night, saying in a statement: "This was a suggestion that was floated and rejected, which ended any further discussion."The Post quoted DHS officials as saying the administration sought to release detainees in the San Francisco-based district of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and in other strongly Democratic districts.It said the White House told ICE that the plan was partly meant to conserve jail space but also partly to "send a message to Democrats."AG Barr: I Think Spying Did Occur on 2016 Trump Campaign
Philly Races Highlight Historic 'Rainbow Wave':::::A win by Henry Sias, who is running for judge in Philadelphia this year, would be a first in the United States.He is trying to become the country's first transgender man to take the bench in a courtroom."There are times when I do feel very humbled by it and thats pretty awesome," Sias, who graduated from Yale Law School, said in an interview with NBC10 about his trailblazing campaign."But when I hear from younger people or their parents, when a parent will say, 'Hey, my kid saw your video,' that sort of puts the wind in my sails."He is part of the strongest contingent of LGBTQ candidates in memory.Five people are running for Philadelphia City Council and two are running for Common Pleas judge.Democrats Deja Lynn Alvarez, Sherrie Cohen, Adrian Rivera-Reyes and Lauren Vidas and Republican Daniel Orsino are running for Council seats in the May 21 primary, while Sias and Tiffany Palmer are seeking judgeships.The municipal general election will be held in November.Philadelphia's "rainbow wave" in this year's municipal elections is one reason that LGBTQ advocates are excited about municipal races across the country this year.The Washington, D.C.-based LGBTQ Victory Fund's endorsed candidate slate in local elections is dominated by the Philly hopefuls.Henry Sias The city has played a pioneering role in the fight for LGBTQ civil rights over the decades.Independence Hall was the site of the earliest recurring gay rights demonstrations, starting in 1965.The oldest LGBTQ bookstore in the country started on South Street and now is located at 12th and Pine streets.Barbara Gittings, who lived in Center City, founded the country's first lesbian magazine, The Ladder.But the rainbow wave reaches far beyond Philadelphia.At the national level, Democrat Peter Buttegieg, a gay Indiana mayor, is exploring a run for president.He raised $7 million in the first quarter of 2019."Last year was called a 'rainbow wave' in Congress," Victory Fund political director Sean Meloy said."We're seeing it continue into this year.And in places like Philly, which I believe is the only top-five city never to elect an LGBTQ person to Council, it's exciting to finally bring that representation."The community is still woefully underrepresented in elected government positions.From local governing bodies to state Capitols to Congress, only one-tenth of 1% of elected officials in the United States identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer, Meloy said.That's a much lower percentage than the 4-to-5% by conservative estimates of the country's population that identifies as LGBTQ, he said."Absolutely it's frustrating to see we're such a big part of Philadelphia as a whole, but have no elected officials in city government," Deja Lynn Alvarez, one of the Council at-large candidates, said.Deja Lynn Alvarez Alvarez said she has worked hard on the campaign trail to raise awareness about the intersection of LGBTQ issues and those facing the entire city."I've faced extreme poverty.I've faced discrimination and homelessness," she said."As a trans woman, I have faced all of those things.Its always the most marginalized in society."Lauren Vidas, who is challenging incumbent Councilman Kenyatta Johnson in the Second Councilmatic district, said Philadelphia's LGBTQ community is no longer synonymous with any single neighborhood."When Im out talking to members of LGBT community, their issues and concerns are the same," Vidas said."We all want affordable housing, good schools, clean streets."Lauren Vidas Philadelphia in this off-year election could be a test for the presidential election year of 2020, when Peter Buttegieg, the gay mayor of South Bend, Indiana, appears poised to throw his name in for the Democratic nomination.He recently gave a speech calling out Vice President Mike Pence."The fact that hes running and representing our community is emboldening to many LGBTQ members," Meloy of the Victory Fund said."And in Philly, it's happening already."Sherrie Cohen, one of the Democrats running for a Council at-large seat, is a trailblazer among the trailblazers.She previously ran for Council in 2011 and 2015, nearly winning eight years ago.Her father, David Cohen, served 38 years on Council.Sherrie Cohen "It's wonderful that there are so many LGBT community members running.It's a testament to people's desire to be involved," Cohen said."I'm a Jewish lesbian.Adrian (Rivera-Reyes) is a Puerto Rican gay man.Deja Alvarez is a trans woman.We have so many people stepping up."Rivera-Reyes, who secured a coveted first position on the May ballot among 32 Democrats running for five Council at-large seats, is all by himself a symbol of Philadelphia's diversity.Adrian Rivera-Reyes "You see it every time you meet someone campaigning," said Rivera-Reyes, who holds a Ph.D in cancer biology from the University of Pennsylvania."There is a craving for having someone like them in government."

Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Is Leaving:::::The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement is leaving his post Friday, the latest departure in a reshuffling of the Department of Homeland Security, NBC News reported.President Donald Trump had nominated the acting director, Ron Vitiello, to become the permanent head of ICE, but pulled his nomination last week.A DHS official said the agency received an email Wednesday with the news that Vitiello would be leaving ICE.DHS has not said who will replace Vitiello as acting director, but Deputy Director Matthew Albence is next in line.Vitiello's departure comes after DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was pressured to resign on Sunday and Secret Service Director Tex Alles resigned on Monday.Trump Purges Homeland Security Dept.After Nielsen Ouster

Trump Admin Wants to Make Asylum Harder by Putting Border Agents in Charge:::::This Nov. 17, 2008, file photo shows U.S. Border Patrol agent Gabriel Pacheco walking back to his vehicle along the border fence in San Diego.The White House is working on plans to make it harder for immigrants at the border to receive asylum by forcing them to do more to prove they have a credible fear of returning home and putting border agents in charge of the interview process, multiple senior administration officials told NBC News.The potential changes are part of President Donald Trump's overhaul of the Department of Homeland Security.Currently, asylum-seekers are interviewed by U.S.Citizenship and Immigration Services asylum officers and only need to express a fear of persecution in their home country in order to pass the first step in the process.A DHS spokesman declined to comment.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.About 90 percent of asylum-seekers pass the credible fear interview, according to data from DHS, but only about 10 percent go on to be granted asylum by a judge.Due to a backlog in immigration courts, those who pass the initial interview live in the U.S., either in detention or at large, for months or years while waiting for their cases to be adjudicated.AG Barr: I Think Spying Did Occur on 2016 Trump Campaign

Eric Swalwell officially declared his bid for the 2020 presidential race Monday evening in an appearance on "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" after much speculation and visits to Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and other states in the months leading up to the announcement.The 38-year-old Democratic congressman who represents Californias 15th Congressional District said in a clip that was released by the show: "I see a country in quicksand, unable to solve problems and threats from abroad, unable to make life better for people here at home.Nothing gets done.I'm ready to solve these problems.I'm running for president of the United States.""It's official," he added to cheers from the audience."Boy did it feel good to say that."The Late Show released the clip on Twitter.The 38-year-old Iowa native was elected in 2012 to represent Californias 15th Congressional District.Swalwell joins what is expected to be a wide-open race for the Democratic presidential nomination.There's no apparent front-runner at this early stage, and he will face off against several of his Senate colleagues who have more name recognition.
Analysis: at the Center of Trump's Homeland Chaos, Stephen Miller Is the Lone Survivor:::::In this March 28, 2019, file photo, White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, left, walks with White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, and White House senior adviser Stephen Miller, to board the Marine One helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, to travel with President Donald Trump en route to Michigan.Amid the chaos, Stephen Miller is in charge now, NBC News reports.The iconoclastic hard-line young conservative policy aide to President Donald Trump, hated by the left, and celebrated by the extreme right, is the obvious winner in the power struggle that led to Kirstjen Nielsen's ousting Sunday night as Homeland Security secretary.He's unofficially taking the reins of border security amid a purge at the department that has also seen Secret Service Director Randolph "Tex" Alles removed from his job and Trump's pick to head the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Ron Vitiello, yanked.Miller has survived them all.He's the only permanent fixture on immigration policy.That means he's running the show and the president's success or failure is on him.AG Barr: I Think Spying Did Occur on 2016 Trump Campaign Attorney General William Barr was asked why he has a team looking into why the FBI opened an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.He said he thought that spying did occur on the Trump campaign.The question was whether it was adequately predicated, he said.(Published Wednesday, April 10, 2019) President Donald Trump's re-election strategy depends on locating Americans who agree with him but don't usually vote and driving them out to the polls in droves.That, he has clearly concluded, means taking the hardest possible line on immigration and presenting it primarily as a security issue.
NJ Sen. Bob Menendez Cracks Down on China in Fight Against Fentanyl:::::New Jersey lawmakers are taking a stance on the flow of dangerous drugs into our country.In Camden County, they announced a plan to crack down on fentanyl through federal sanctions against China.NBC10 Reporter Cyndey Long has the latest on how this legislation could impact people in our area.A local lawmaker is demanding accountability from China and their role in Americas opioid epidemic.On Monday, New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez announced the Fentanyl Sanctions Act.The federal legislation would impose sanctions on China and Chinese entities who supply and support the trafficking of fentanyl, a synthetic opiate 50 times more potent than heroin, in the United States."Over the past five years, fentanyl poured into our country from China and saturated our communities with deadly consequences," Sen. Menendez, a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said during a press conference in Camden, New Jersey.Last summer, DEA agents raided a Chinese cargo ship at the Port of Philadelphia, discovering 110 pounds of fentanyl worth about $1.7 million."If it had gotten in the street it would have killed an enormous amount of people," Menendez said.Under the legislation, companies producing fentanyl would be blacklisted from U.S. markets.The Act would also invest in port security and expand access to life-saving treatment while holding the Chinese government accountable for enforcing their recently announced ban on all fentanyl."The bottom line is that we cannot simply take Chinas word for it when they say theyll crack down on fentanyl manufacturersespecially when American lives are at stake," Sen. Menendez said."With the Fentanyl Sanctions Act, we can send a clear message to the Chinese government that says your actions will have consequences."The Act would also allow new funding to law enforcement and intelligence agencies to fight foreign opioid trafficking and establish a commission that would monitor U.S. efforts and report on more effective ways to fight the flow of synthetic opioids from China, Mexico and other countries.In 2018, 3,163 New Jersey residents died from an opioid overdose with 312 in Camden County.In 60% of those cases, fentanyl was to blame.The epidemic hit Camden city especially hard."So far this year weve lost 63 Camden residents to an overdose," Camden County Freeholder Lou Capelli said."Weve had 147 Narcan deployments."Camden also had 90 fatal overdoses in 2017, more than 2016 and 2015 combined, with fentanyl being the primary culprit, according to Camden County Metro Police Chief Scott Thomson."We will continue our collaboration with state and federal law enforcement partners in the relentless pursuit of those trafficking this extremely lethal product to get this poison off our streets," Chief Thomson said."And I want to thank our representatives for putting more resources into the effort."

Brexit: Conservatives and Labour continue talks:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Michael Gove and John McDonnell have been involved in the talks The government and Labour have held further talks aimed at breaking the deadlock in Parliament over Brexit.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said discussions with cabinet ministers David Lidington and Michael Gove had been "positive" and "constructive".He added that a timetable was being worked out for more meetings over the next seven to 10 days.EU leaders have agreed to delay the UK's departure date from 12 April to 31 October, to avoid a no-deal Brexit.But Prime Minister Theresa May has said the UK can still leave before 22 May, if Parliament backs the withdrawal agreement she reached with the EU.This would avoid the UK having to take part in European Parliament elections, currently scheduled for 23 May.The UK was originally due to leave the EU on 29 March, but its departure date has been delayed twice, after the Commons rejected the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU by large margins.The meeting between Mr McDonnell, members of Jeremy Corbyn's staff and Mr Gove and Mr Lidington lasted just over an hour.Asked if the government had moved on its "red lines", Mr McDonnell told reporters: "I'm not going into the detail of it."We are trying to be as constructive as we possibly can on all sides... but we will see by the end of next week how far we have got."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.What's happened during the talks?BBC political correspondent Iain Watson has been told that the Conservative and Labour delegations have discussed some of the fine detail of the potential changes to the "political declaration" - the non-legally binding part of the Brexit deal, which sets out a blueprint for future relations between the EU and UK.But he said the two sides were still some way apart on customs arrangements.Labour wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, which would allow tariff-free trade in goods.The government has repeatedly ruled out remaining in the EU's customs union, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy.Under EU rules, the UK will have to hold European Parliament elections in May, or face leaving on 1 June without a deal.Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: "Clearly nobody wants to fight the European elections."It feels like a pointless exercise and the only way we can avoid that is by getting a deal agreed and done quickly, and if we can do that by 22 May, we can avoid fighting the European parliamentary elections."In any case we want to ensure any British MEPs that are elected never have to take their seats in the European Parliament by ensuring this is all done well before the new European Parliament convenes."Meanwhile, the government says it will "continue to make all necessary preparations" for a no-deal Brexit.A government source said "plans will evolve and adapt", but would not stop while the chance of leaving the EU without an agreement remained.The source said that a leaked message which reportedly referred to the "winding down" of no-deal preparation related only to Operation Yellowhammer - the contingency planning programme based on worst-case scenarios - and not no-deal planning in general.But the government has confirmed it is stopping Operation Brock - the contraflow put on the London-bound carriageway of the M20 in Kent - "in light of the reduced threat of disruption to services across the English Channel in the coming weeks".
Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party ahead of European elections:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nigel Farage: "No more Mr Nice Guy."Ex-UKIP leader Nigel Farage has launched his new Brexit Party, saying he wants a "democratic revolution" in UK politics.Speaking in Coventry, he said May's expected European elections were the party's "first step" but its "first task" was to "change politics"."I said that if I did come back into the political fray it would be no more Mr Nice Guy and I mean it," he said.But UKIP dismissed the Brexit Party as a "vehicle" for Mr Farage.The launch comes after Prime Minister Theresa May agreed a Brexit delay to 31 October with the EU, with the option of leaving earlier if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament.This means the UK is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May.Mr Farage said the Brexit Party had an "impressive list" of 70 candidates for the elections.Among those revealed at the launch was Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of leading Conservative Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.Mr Farage said: "This party is not here just to fight the European elections... this party is not just to express our anger - 23 May is the first step of the Brexit Party.We will change politics for good."He said he was "angry, but this is not a negative emotion, this is a positive emotion".The party had already received 750,000 online over 10 days, he said, made up of small donations of up to 500.Image copyright AFP Image caption Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of leading Conservative Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, was revealed as a Brexit Party candidate Ms Rees-Mogg said she had stuck with the Conservatives "through thick and thin", but added: "We've got to rescue our democracy, we have got to show that the people of this country have a say in how we are run."Who is Annunziata Rees-Mogg?Annunziata Rees-Mogg joined the Conservative Party, at the age of five, in 1984.She says she canvassed for the party from the age of eight.The sister of Conservative Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, Ms Rees-Mogg stood unsuccessfully as a Conservative candidate in the 2005 and 2010 general elections.The freelance journalist has written for the Daily Telegraph, MoneyWeek and the European.Earlier, Mr Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "In terms of policy, there's no difference (to UKIP), but in terms of personnel there is a vast difference."UKIP did struggle to get enough good people into it but unfortunately what it's chosen to do is allow the far right to join it and take it over and I'm afraid the brand is now tarnished."He promised the Brexit Party would be "deeply intolerant of all intolerance" and would represent a cross-section of society.Image copyright Reuters Image caption UKIP leader Gerard Batten said the Brexit Party was "just a vehicle" for Nigel Farage UKIP leader Gerard Batten tweeted that Mr Farage's suggestion that there was no difference in policy between UKIP and the Brexit Party was "a lie".He said: "UKIP has a manifesto and policies.Farage's party is just a vehicle for him."He said the Brexit Party's "only purpose is to re-elect him (Mr Farage)" and was a "Tory/Establishment safety valve".The Electoral Commission has issued European Parliamentary elections guidance for returning officers to advise them "on the rules should the elections go ahead" and to ensure they "have as much certainty as possible in developing contingency plans".
Upskirting now a crime after woman's campaign:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gina Martin campaigned for the law to be changed after a man took a picture up her skirt Upskirting is now a criminal offence in England and Wales after a campaign by a woman targeted at a music festival.Offenders will face up to two years in prison for taking an image or video under somebody's clothing in order to see their genitals or underwear.Gina Martin, who led the calls for change, said she hoped the change in law would help people "feel comfortable" to report such crimes.It is already a specific crime in Scotland but not in Northern Ireland.Speaking on the day the law came into effect, Ms Martin called on people to report upskirting when they see it happen.She told BBC News: "If a new law's there, great - but if we don't know about it or aren't reporting it, [then] it doesn't do anything."We have to build a picture of how much this happens, because it happens a lot."Prime Minister Theresa May described upskirting as "degrading and humiliating" and said offenders should "feel the full force of the law".How the law was changed Ms Martin, 27, was waiting to watch The Killers perform at the British Summer Time music festival in London's Hyde Park in July 2017 when a man put his phone between her legs and took pictures.After informing the police, she was shocked to discover upskirting was not a specific offence and the case had been closed.A few days later she wrote about what had happened on Facebook.Her post went viral with other women sharing similar experiences.Soon an online petition calling for police to reopen the case had received 50,000 signatures.She also wrote a feature for the BBC News website explaining her battle, recalling the dramatic moment she chased after the man who had taken the unwanted photo.Image copyright @beaniegigi Image caption Gina Martin could not believe upskirting was not already a criminal offence It wasn't long before the campaign was picked up by Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse.Encouraged by government ministers, she brought a private members' bill backing the creation of an upskirting offence.Her bill was expected to sail through the Commons, but parliamentary rules meant it only required one MP to shout "object" to block its progress.The bill was initially blocked by a Tory backbench MP, in a move which was widely criticised.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hear MPs shout "shame" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill However, Ms Martin's campaign secured government backing on 15 July last year and the Voyeurism (Offences) (No.2) Bill was put before Parliament days later.The new legislation was approved in the House of Lords and has now passed the formality of Royal Assent to become law.At the time, Ms Martin said: "To the outsider, the ordinary person, law and politics are complex and daunting.But both are penetrable if you believe in yourself and find the right support."She said the experience had been a "steep learning curve" in how the political system works - but that the decision was "politics and society at its best".Analysis By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Until now offenders could only be prosecuted for voyeurism or outraging public decency.But voyeurism only applies to filming in "private" while outraging public decency usually requires a witness - and upskirting often goes unobserved.So, following tireless campaigning by Gina Martin, the government has created a specific offence of upskirting where the purpose is to obtain sexual gratification, or to cause humiliation, distress or alarm.It covers culprits who say images were just taken "for a laugh", and paparazzi who take intrusive images.What is the new law?The new offences apply in instances when: Without consent, a person takes pictures beneath a person's clothing to observe their genitals or buttocks, whether covered or uncovered by underwear The offender has a motive of either gaining sexual gratification or causing humiliation, distress or alarm to the victim The Voyeurism (Offences) Act 2019 also ensures that the most serious offenders, where the purpose of the offence is for sexual gratification, are made subject to notification requirements (often referred to as being placed on the sex offenders' register).More incidents reported New police figures show that more people are reporting upskirting.Data obtained by the Press Association shows that the number of reported incidents rose from a total of 78 between April 2015 and April 2017 to 94 for the whole of 2018.The vast majority of cases involve female victims and male perpetrators, according to the data released by police forces under Freedom of Information laws.The police forces gave details of the incidents reported to them last year, with victims including pensioners and schoolchildren.One case involved a 70-year-old woman, Essex Police said.The same force was involved in a case where a suspect was charged with indecency after upskirt images of a child aged between seven and nine were discovered in his possession.Campaigners from a children's charity, Plan International UK, suggest that the problem could be more widespread than official figures show.The charity says its own research, which surveyed 1,004 girls in the UK aged between 14-21, found that one in 10 girls have experienced upskirting, and 52% didn't tell anyone about what happened to them.Lucy Russell, head of girls' rights and youth at the charity, said: "The government is recognising that street harassment is not OK, which is a huge step forward."However, street harassment has become so normalised that girls are telling us they aren't speaking out about it because they're too embarrassed or think they won't be taken seriously."She suggested more action should be taken at local level to encourage women to report offences.'Full force of the law' Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption "He was laughing": Three women tell the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire about their experience of upskirting Before the law was passed victims and police in England and Wales were only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism.Unlike other sexual offences, victims of those crimes do not have automatic anonymity.The Ministry of Justice said the new law "bans the degrading practice to deter perpetrators, better protect victims, and bring more offenders to justice".Justice Minister Lucy Frazer added: "We have always been clear - there are no excuses for this behaviour and offenders should feel the full force of the law.From today, they will."By taking decisive action and working closely with Gina Martin and other campaigners, we have ensured more people are protected from this degrading and humiliating practice."In Northern Ireland, upskirting is still not a specific offence although the Department of Justice (DoJ) has launched a consultation on potential changes to legislation.
Hammond: Brexit deadlock leaves little room for key issues:::::It is time to get Brexit "off the table" so that Britain can focus on other issues, the chancellor has said.Philip Hammond told the BBC that getting a deal done soon would release the "bandwidth" needed to take key economic decisions facing the country.He called the UK's involvement in May's European elections "pointless" and hoped a deal would be done before then.Mr Hammond was speaking in Washington, where he is attending World Bank and IMF meetings.The chancellor said talking to the Labour Party about finding a way forward to resolve the Parliamentary impasse was not his "preferred route".But it offered a new way forward to achieve a Brexit deal, after which he could concentrate on issues such spending and "where our economy is going over the next few years"."I would like us to spend more of our bandwidth focused on growing our economy," he told the BBC's economics correspondent Dharshini David."Until a deal is done we cannot make decisions about the spending review."'All will be forgotten' If a deal on leaving the EU cannot be agreed by the end of May, the UK is committed to fighting the European elections."Clearly nobody wants to fight the European elections.It feels like a pointless exercise, and the only way we can avoid that is by getting a deal agreed and done quickly."If we can do that by 22 May, we can avoid fighting the European parliamentary elections."In any case, we want to ensure any British MEPs that are elected never have to take their seats in the European Parliament by ensuring this is all done well before the new European Parliament convenes," he said.The chancellor is in Washington at the World Bank and IMF spring meetings.He rejected suggestions that the handling of Brexit negotiations was being seen overseas as a national humiliation."Britain is known as a bastion of democracy, and how we manage a challenging and complex issue like this is of huge interest," he said."In a year's time, when this is behind us and people are focussed on other things, all this will be forgotten."
MP Heidi Allen 'shaken to core' by 'Brexit hate mail':::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption MP Heidi Allen was the target of malicious communications An MP who was sent death threats "related to Brexit" said the messages had "shaken her to the core".Heidi Allen, South Cambridgeshire MP and interim leader of the Independent Group, was one of seven MPs targeted by Jarod Kirkman.It made her feel "very vulnerable", she said, but did not cause her to question her role as an MP, adding: "I will not be bullied."Kirkman has admitted sending malicious communications and awaits sentencing.Ms Allen, who quit the Conservatives to join the Independent Group in February, said Kirkman's threats were not the only abusive messages she had received.'They'll find you' "The language is always very cryptically and craftily worded - you know, 'we're coming for you, we won't tell you when or how' - and when something like that just pops into your inbox... it shakes you to the core, particularly when you don't know where it's come from, or whether that person is 10 yards away or 100 miles away - you just have no idea and you just feel very, very vulnerable."Asked whether she felt Brexit had "tipped some people over the edge", she said she did not pretend to understand the "psyche of these individuals", but added: "It certainly feels in my limited knowledge - I'm not a psychologist - that there's almost a platform or an excuse, that it's unleashed something and it's OK, and you don't need to temper your language."She said although some messages were sent anonymously with fake email addresses - as was the case with Kirkman - police could "still find people... they'll find you".Ms Allen said a separate case of abuse against her was currently being investigated by police.She described this case as "the most worrying" she had experienced so far, and said it made her "worried for my own personal safety"."Will it stop me being an MP?No.But does it modify my behaviour out and about?Yes it does, I'm afraid," she added.
Julian Assange should not be extradited to US:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Assange was found guilty of a British charge, but he could be extradited to the US to face a separate charge Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the UK government should not extradite Julian Assange to the US, where he faces a computer hacking charge.The Wikileaks co-founder was arrested for a separate charge at Ecuador's London embassy on Thursday, where he had been granted asylum since 2012.Mr Corbyn said Assange should not be extradited "for exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan".Meanwhile, Ecuador's leader expressed anger at how Assange had behaved.Australian-born Assange, 47, sought refuge in the Knightsbridge embassy seven years ago, to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault case that has since been dropped.But Ecuador abruptly withdrew its asylum and invited the police to arrest Assange on Thursday.After his dramatic arrest, he was taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court and found guilty of a British charge of breaching bail.He spent Thursday night in custody and is facing up to 12 months in prison for that conviction.The Met said it cost an estimated 13.2m to police Ecuador's London embassy between June 2012 and October 2015, when the force withdrew the physical presence of officers.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Video footage shows Julian Assange being dragged from the Ecuadorian embassy in London The Swedish authorities are now considering whether to reopen an investigation into the allegations of sexual assault, which Assange denies.The US government has also charged him with allegations of conspiracy to break into a computer, relating to a massive leak of classified US government documents.The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange, and if he was convicted, he could face up to five years in jail.Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that "this is all about Wikileaks and all of that embarrassing information about the activities of the American military and security services that was made public".But she said Assange should also face the criminal justice system if the Swedish government charged him.Swedish prosecutors dropped a rape investigation into Assange into 2017 because they were unable to formally notify him of the allegations - a necessary step in proceeding with the case - while he remained in the Ecuadorian embassy.Assange battle 'now political' In a tweet, Mr Corbyn shared a video said to be of Pentagon footage - which had been released by Wikileaks - of a 2007 air strike which implicated US military in the killing of civilians and two journalists.The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale said backing Assange is not without political risk and will not find universal favour among Labour MPs - but Mr Corbyn's intervention "means the battle over Assange's future will now be as much political as it is legal".Image copyright Julia Quenzler, BBC Image caption Australian-born Assange at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday The editor of Wikileaks, Kristinn Hrafnsson, has expressed fears that the US could file more serious charges against Assange, and that if he was convicted he could be behind bars for "decades".Mr Hrafnsson added that Assange had been thrown "overboard" by Ecuador - and the country was "horrible" to treat him like that.'He was a problem' Meanwhile in Ecuador, President Lenin Moreno criticised Assange, claiming that after spending seven years in the country's embassy he had dismissed Ecuador by describing it as an insignificant country."We had treated him as a guest," he said."But not anymore."Ecuador's ambassador to the UK, Jaime Marchan, also previously said Assange had been "continually a problem" while he was living in the embassy.Meanwhile, a man who is alleged to have links with Assange has been arrested while trying to leave Ecuador, the country's officials said.The man - who has been identified by supporters as a Swedish software developer called Ola Bini - had been trying to board a flight to Japan.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption He's been in Ecuador's embassy for seven years -

Brexit: Theresa May defends 31 October delay to MPs:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Theresa May: "If we want to get on with leaving, we need to start this process soon."Theresa May has told MPs it remains her "priority" to deliver Brexit, defending the decision to delay the UK's exit from the EU.The new deadline of 31 October means the UK is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections in May.The prime minister said that if the deal agreed with the EU was passed, the UK could leave the EU "as soon as possible".Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called the latest delay a "diplomatic failure".The prime minister promised to pursue an "orderly" Brexit, adding that the "whole country" was "frustrated".Brexit was originally set to happen on 29 March.But after MPs repeatedly rejected Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, the deadline was put back to 12 April.The new 31 October deadline averts the prospect of the UK having to leave the EU without a deal this Friday.The government said on Thursday it would "continue to make all necessary preparations" for a no-deal Brexit, after it was reported that departments had stood down their planning.A government source said "plans will evolve and adapt" but would not stop, while the chance of leaving the EU without an agreement remained.The source added that a leaked message referring to the "winding down" of no deal preparation related only to Operation Yellowhammer, the contingency planning operation based on worst-case scenarios - and not no-deal planning in general.Under EU rules, the UK will have to hold European Parliament elections in May, or face leaving on 1 June without a deal.In a statement to the House of Commons, Mrs May said she "profoundly" regretted her deal not being agreed to by MPs.She said: "The whole country is intensely frustrated that this process of leaving the European Union has not been completed."On the latest delay, she said: "The choices we face are stark and the timetable is clear.I believe we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest."And she told MPs that the UK would hold full EU membership rights during the extension, saying the country "would continue to be bound by all our ongoing obligations as a member state, including the duty of sincere co-operation".Talks with Labour The government is continuing to hold talks with Labour aimed at achieving a consensus on how to break the deadlock in Parliament.Mrs May and Mr Corbyn had a "short meeting" on Thursday, Labour said.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn says the Article 50 delay is a "diplomatic failure" In Parliament, Mrs May said: "Reaching an agreement will not be easy, because to be successful it will require both sides to make compromises."But however challenging it may be politically, I profoundly believe that in this unique situation where the House is deadlocked, it is incumbent on both front benches to seek to work together to deliver what the British people voted for."In response, Mr Corbyn said: "The second extension in the space of a fortnight represents not only a diplomatic failure but is another milestone in the government's mishandling of the entire Brexit process."He added: "The prime minister has stuck rigidly to a flawed plan and now the clock has run down, leaving Britain in limbo and adding to the deep uncertainty of business, workers and people all across this country."Mr Corbyn said cross-party talks were "serious, detailed and ongoing", but warned that the government would "have to compromise".If no agreement was possible, he said: "We believe all options should remain on the table, including the option of a public vote."What happens next?Shortly - Talks continue between the Conservatives and Labour on how to end the Brexit impasse 23 April - MPs return from Parliament's Easter recess 2 May - Local elections take place in England and Northern Ireland 23 May - European Parliament elections are scheduled to happen in the UK, if MPs do not back Theresa May's agreement with the EU in time to avert them 31 October - The UK leaves the EU, unless MPs back the withdrawal agreement in advance of this deadline Ian Blackford, the SNP's Westminster leader, urged Mrs May to use the extra time to hold a second EU referendum.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption After Bill Cash calls on her to resign, Theresa May replies: "I think you know the answer to that.""It's now a very real possibility that we can remain in the European Union," he said."As of today, there are 204 days until the new Brexit deadline on the 31 October, so will the prime minister now remove the ridiculous excuse that there isn't enough time to hold a second referendum with remain on the ballot paper?"And Brexiteer Conservative MP Sir Bill Cash accused the prime minister of "abject surrender" to the EU in allowing the delay and said she should resign.Before the Brussels summit, Mrs May had told leaders she wanted to move the UK's exit date from this Friday to 30 June, with the option of leaving earlier if Parliament ratified her agreement.What was agreed in Brussels?A Brexit extension "only as long as necessary" and "no longer than 31 October" to allow for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement The UK "must hold the elections to the European Parliament" and if it fails to do this, the UK will leave on 1 June The European Council reiterates there can be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement negotiations European Council President Donald Tusk said future developments were "entirely in the UK's hands", adding: "They can still ratify the withdrawal agreement, in which case the extension can be terminated."Mr Tusk said the UK could also rethink its strategy or choose to "cancel Brexit altogether", but urged: "Please do not waste this time."The EU had been split over the length of delay to offer the UK, and by law its other 27 member states had to reach a unanimous decision.

IMF's Lagarde says further Brexit delay will 'hinder' UK growth:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Christine Lagarde says she hopes a Brexit deal can be struck quickly Further uncertainty over Brexit will hinder growth in the UK economy, the head of IMF has told the BBC.Speaking ahead of the agreement of an extension to Article 50, Christine Lagarde warned that businesses and investors will remain hesitant in the coming months.She said any prolonged uncertainty would have a "negative impact".Ms Lagarde, a former French finance minister, said she hoped a deal could be struck quickly.Speaking at the World Bank and IMF Spring Meetings in Washington, Ms Lagarde said: "If there was a prolonged uncertainty, we can suspect that the impact on confidence would continue because, you know, whether you're talking about investors, whether you're talking about decisions as to where to expand where to set up how to organize a supply chain, people are going to wonder, you know, what comes next and and how will it settle?"So it would have a negative impact, no question about it. "Ms Lagarde also expressed sympathy with the plight of British businesses.She highlighted that even with the contingency plans in place, they would face disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit and may have to be resigned to taking a hit to their balance sheets and possibly market share.'Very sad' Earlier in the week, the IMF warned that no deal would cause the UK economy to shrink, echoing the scenarios published by the Government and the Bank of England.Revealing her personal insight, the IMF managing director said the Brexit process was "very, very concerning on the one hand and very sad"."I grew up across the Channel and in the city of Le Havre, and to me being able to go across to Southampton, in an easy and unhampered way, was wonderful."Ms Lagarde told journalists that "Having my positive hat on it removes the risk of the no-deal Brexit on April 12, so at least the UK is not leaving on April 12 without a deal."We believe that the no deal Brexit would have been a terrible outcome."Brexit is among risks the IMF has flagged at what it termed a delicate time for the global economy in its World Economic Outlook, with others including trade tensions between the US and China and high corporate debt levels in many countries.It said it hoped to see a rebound in global growth later this year but admitted that was "precarious".
Unregistered schools given council funding:::::Image copyright Getty Images Local authorities are paying for places for children in settings that are not even registered, Ofsted is warning.England's education watchdog has called for tougher rules on tackling illegal "schools" with risks of poor conditions and a lack of safeguarding.Inspectors suggest 6,000 children are taught in such unregulated settings.But the watchdog said councils were subsidising these unregistered alternatives to school, paying up to 27,000 a year for places.Ofsted has published its most detailed breakdown of the problem of children being taught in uninspected and unregistered settings.'Appalling conditions' Sue Will, senior officer for unregistered schools, said some had "quite appalling" conditions, with unsafe accommodation and unqualified staff.She said inspectors had come across places with rat traps, holes in the wall and exposed electrics.Since 2016, inspectors have investigated more than 530 unregistered settings - with the biggest number being so-called "alternative provision".These can be for pupils who have been taken out of mainstream schools or who have been excluded.Ofsted says almost 150 investigations have been in alternative provision settings which were without any registration.These can be very poor quality, say inspectors - and instead of getting an education, teenagers "languish, wasting their time" playing on computer games.These are private operations, but inspectors say some places are funded with public money.Ofsted would not name the location, but its inspectors have issued a formal warning to an alternative provision centre receiving 27,000 a year per child from the local authority.'Most vulnerable' Last autumn, in a landmark court case, two people in London became the first to be convicted of running an illegal school.But inspectors said that many children were still being taught in this "murky world", with the biggest number in London and the West Midlands.Image copyright Ofsted Image caption Ofsted inspectors found "appalling" conditions in some classrooms Councils funding unregistered schools Victor Shafiee, in charge of Ofsted's efforts to tackle unregistered schools, says it was often the "least capable looking after the most vulnerable"."These are not well-run, well-organised places.It's hapless people who don't know what they're doing - and that puts children at risk," said Mr Shafiee.About one in five of the places under investigation had links to religious groups - and among these the most common were Muslim, with a smaller number of Jewish and Christian settings.Inspectors warned that some parents were misusing the label of "home schooling", when they were really sending their children to these unregistered centres each day.From the 530 places under investigation, there have been 71 warnings issued - and Mr Shafiee said there were two more court cases expected.While councils might have paid for some places in alternative provision centres, most settings were collecting fees from parents, often of about 2,500 per year.Inspectors said this was "unfathomable" considering families could get free places at local state schools.Hard to prove But Ofsted officials warned of the difficulties of enforcing school registration, when there was ambiguity about the definition of what constituted a school.The guidelines suggest that anywhere teaching five or more school-age children for more than 18 hours per week should be seen as schools and as such, required to be registered.Image caption Ofsted's Victor Shafiee said it was often hard for inspectors to gain access to unregistered premises But inspectors said some of these "tuition centres", or "alternative provision" classes or other settings, might say they teach for only 17 hours and 50 minutes and so seek to remain exempt from registration.Proving whether these are really operating as full-time schools is very difficult, the Ofsted inspectors argued.When Ofsted tries to check, Mr Shafiee said there can be a "rigmarole" of trying to gain entry, giving schools time to conceal what they are doing.They also had no right to seize documents or registers that would indicate that these premises were open longer than the 18-hour-a-week mark.Sean Harford, Ofsted's national director of education, said inspectors were hampered by "significant limitations on our powers to search, to take evidence and to close them down"."The problem here is first and foremost about safeguarding.Many of these places are unsafe - with poor facilities and hygiene, badly trained or untrained staff," said Mr Shafiee."These settings deny children a proper education and can leave them at risk of harm," he said.A Department for Education spokesman said Ofsted had been given 3m to tackle unregistered schools and to "make sure illegal activity is uncovered and justice is delivered".He said Ofsted's report showed the importance of plans to introduce a register of children not being taught in school.Unregulated schools "present a danger to both the quality of education and the welfare of those children who attend them", said the DfE spokesman.
Brexit extension: What just happened?:::::Video European Union leaders have granted the UK a six-month extension to Brexit until 31 October, after five hours of talks in Brussels.But how did this happen?BBC Brussels Reporter Adam Fleming explains all.
Brexit: Home Office sorry for EU citizen data breach:::::Image copyright Getty Images The Home Office has apologised to hundreds of EU citizens seeking settled status in the UK after accidentally sharing their details.It blamed an "administrative error" for sending an email that revealed 240 personal email addresses - a likely breach of the Data Protection Act.The department may now have to make an apology in Parliament.In a statement to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, it said it had since improved its systems and procedures.One recipient of the email told Today that she was outraged and was considering returning to Germany.The Home Office sent the email on Sunday 7 April asking applicants, who had already struggled with technical problems, to resubmit their information.But it failed to use the "blind CC" box on the email, revealing the details of other applicants.In another message apologising to those who had been affected, the Home Office wrote: "The deletion of the email you received from us on 7 April 2019 would be greatly appreciated."The government has already made an unreserved apology after making a similar error with emails sent to 500 members of the Windrush generation.The department notified the Information Commissioner's Office and made a statement in Parliament.EU citizens in the UK before Brexit can apply for settled status, which allows them to continue to live and work there afterwards.Applicants and campaigning groups have criticised the system, saying it has proved slow and bureaucratic for some.Nicolas Hatton, from the 3 Million group that campaigns for EU citizens' rights, said the incident showed the settled status process was not sufficiently robust."It feels like it adds insult to injury," he said.A Home Office spokesman said: "In communicating with a small group of applicants, an administrative error was made which meant other applicants' email addresses could be seen."As soon as the error was identified, we apologised personally to the 240 applicants affected and have improved our systems and procedures to stop this occurring again."
Brexit: Leo Varadkar hints at UK say in future trade deals:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leo Varadkar was speaking in Brussels ahead of an EU summit The Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), Leo Varadkar, has suggested that the UK would be able to have a say in trade deals if it forms a customs union with the EU.A customs union is a major focus of Brexit talks between Labour and the Conservatives.It is Labour policy to form a permanent customs union with the EU.Many Conservatives oppose that idea saying the UK would be subject to EU trade deals but with no say.However, the Taoiseach suggested the EU would be able to develop a 'sui generis' (unique) arrangement for the UK, and said the proposal for the UK to stay in a customs union with the EU after Brexit has "real merit"."I believe as the EU having the UK in a customs union means we could get the best deals for all of us," he said.Image copyright EPA Image caption Leo Varadkar arrives for a special EU summit on Brexit in Brussels "If the UK were to decide to stay in a customs union, we would be able to develop something 'sui generis' so that they would have a say around things in terms of future trade deals, and a level playing field around labour rights and environmental rights."Mr Varadkar was speaking in Brussels ahead of a crucial EU summit.Leaders are due to discuss the UK's request for another extension, to avoid a no-deal Brexit on Friday.Image copyright AFP Image caption Leo Varadkar and Irish Europe minister Helen McEntee at the EU Council summit Mr Varadkar also said he did not want the EU to grant an extension "that goes on forever and causes the impasse to continue".What is a customs union?Countries in a customs union agree not to impose charges - known as tariffs - or custom checks on each other's goods.The rules also mean that any goods coming in from the rest of the world pay the same tariff - irrespective of where in the customs union those goods first enter.This is known as a common external tariff.The EU customs union includes the 28 EU member states as well as Monaco.The EU also has customs union arrangements with non-EU members: Turkey, Andorra and San Marino.But under (the EU's) customs union rules, members cannot negotiate their own independent trade deals with countries from the rest of the world.Instead, free trade deals (ie agreements that reduce or eliminate tariffs between countries) can only be negotiated by the EU as a whole.What is Labour's plan?It would see the UK join a new permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, and have the power to have a say in future EU trade talks.The idea that the UK would be allowed such a say has been dismissed by Michael Gove, the Environment Secretary.He has declared Labour's position "an unprecedented legal and political novelty of the kind that is rightly called a unicorn".
Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict:::::Image copyright UK Parliament Just hours ahead of her solo pitch to 27 EU leaders for a short delay to Brexit, Theresa May faced Jeremy Corbyn at the dispatch box.Here is what happened.While talks continued between the Conservatives and Labour on breaking the parliamentary deadlock on the UK's exit from the EU, the Labour leader avoided the issue of Brexit.Mr Corbyn did mark the 21st anniversary of the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland - as did Mrs May and the SNP's Ian Blackford - and called for it to be maintained post-Brexit.But he moved on to attack Mrs May over local council funding, claiming nine of the 10 most deprived council areas in the country had seen cuts almost three times the average of any other council."We shouldn't forget communities across the country abandoned by this government," he said.The PM defended her record, saying councils have more money available this year; and she said her government "listened to councils", for example by lifting the borrowing cap at their request to help funding to build new homes.Mr Corbyn threw more statistics across the dispatch box, saying cuts in Swindon alone amounted to 235 per household and in Stoke-on-Trent it rose to 640, but the affluent county of Surrey was seeing an increase in its funding.He also claimed 500,000 more children had gone into relative poverty and, in Stoke alone, 4,000 food bank parcels had been handed out to children.The Labour leader asked: "Does she think areas with the highest levels of deprivation deserve facing the largest cuts in their budget?"The PM said members across the House "should take action to make sure families are getting more money into their pockets".Mrs May listed measures taken by her government, from freezing fuel duty to introducing the Living Wage, adding: "He should be backing these measures instead of voting against them."She admitted that the government had asked local councils "to take difficult decisions to living with our means", but only because of the deficit left by Labour.In their last exchange, Mr Corbyn said it was a "political choice to impose austerity", which was "vindictive and damaging".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May on council funding He concluded: "Far from tackling burning injustices [she has] pushed councils to the brink and left those 'just about managing' not being able to manage at all.That is her legacy."Mrs May said she was proud in what her government had achieved, including better schools, more jobs and lower borrowing.She finished by saying a Labour government led by Mr Corbyn would be about "destroying our defences, abandoning our allies, [seeing] billions more in borrowing, fewer opportunities and higher taxes for everyone.That's a Labour future and we will never let it happen."What else came up?The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, was not afraid to focus on Brexit.He asked the prime minister outright whether the government had offered a further referendum to Labour during their talks - "yes or no?"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ian Blackford and Theresa May on new EU referendum Mrs May reiterated her opposition to another public vote and reminded him the Commons had voted on and rejected such an outcome twice.But Mr Blackford stayed on topic, saying: "People can't have faith in a backroom deal cooked up by two leaders who don't possess the ingredients to hold their parties together, never mind hold these islands together."He then asked her whether she would accept a longer extension from the EU if offered at the summit later.The PM said she had "made her position clear", but took a jibe at the SNP MP, saying: "It is a little difficult for many of us in this House to hear him week after week stand up and say that the UK should stay within the European Union when Scottish independence would have meant taking Scotland out of the European Union."Mr Blackford wasn't the only one highlighting Brexit either, as Conservative MP Henry Smith warned of the cost of a long extension to the UK.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption PMQs: Henry Smith and Theresa May on Brexit extension costs Police funding came up on both sides of the Commons.Conservative Theresa Villiers brought up a case of a 15-year-old in her constituency chased by three men with a knife and criticised London's Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan for closing her local police station.But Labour's Wayne David showed the PM a graph on how her government's choices on funding had affected the police in Wales.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption PMQs: Theresa Villiers and Wayne David on police funding Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas called on the prime minister to speak to more young campaigners about threats to the environment.Mrs May said it gave her an opportunity to praise the green credentials of a school in her constituency.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Caroline Lucas and Theresa May on Greta Thunberg The verdict?Here is BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy's take.Image copyright UK Parliament You wouldn't guess from PMQs that the UK is on the eve of an emergency European Council which could see Brexit postponed for perhaps a year.The elephant in the Chamber sat quietly at the back, emitting the occasional gentle belch, as the main protagonists argued about council spending in the run up to the local elections on 2 May - trading soundbites about Tory austerity and Labour's record deficits.The SNP's Ian Blackford wasn't playing and, on its 21st anniversary, he opened on the impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement.And he attacked the Conservatives and Labour as "Brexit parties", as they continue their talks on a possible deal to get some agreed form of Brexit through the Commons.It was noticeable that the PM did not answer Mr Blackford's well-targeted question about whether a referendum was on the table in those talks - merely observing that some in the Commons might propose a referendum, but her position had not changed.A few antennae quivered at that careful formulation.The PM took some rather diffident Brexit fire from her own side, but not as much as might have been expected the morning after 97 Conservatives defied the party whip and voted against a further postponement.It was mild rather than bitter.Craig Tracey said Britain had nothing to fear from a no-deal exit.Henry Smith complained about the cost of Brexit payments to the EU, and David Duguid offered an easy hit for the PM about leaving the Commons Fisheries Policy.Any thought that the PM might be treated to a pre-summit monstering from Brexiteer backbenchers, to demonstrate that she might not be able to deliver whatever she promised EU leaders, was soon dispelled.The troops were on best behaviour.
Ex-Brexit minister unclear if he will vote Tory in Euro elections:::::Image caption David Jones was unclear on whether he would vote Conservative A former Conservative Brexit minister has refused to rule out voting for a party other than his own if a European election is held."My vote is a matter between me and the ballot box," David Jones, MP for Clwyd West, told BBC Wales.EU leaders are deciding later whether the UK's Brexit date should be extended.A long extension is likely to require elections for the European Parliament to be held on 23 May.Theresa May has asked for an extension to 30 June to get the Brexit deal passed in the House of Commons.But EU leaders are expected to offer a longer delay, with conditions.The UK is currently due to leave the EU on Friday.When asked whether he might vote for UKIP or the newly-formed Brexit Party Mr Jones said: "My vote is a matter between me and the ballot box."Asked if it was not guaranteed he will vote Conservative, he added: "I've given you my answer."Mr Jones said the prime minister should be ensuring that the UK leaves the European Union "as quickly as possible" and that the current situation is "humiliating, not just for the prime minister herself but for the country as a whole".He said if European elections take place in the UK because of a delay to Brexit "it's going to be a pretty farcical situation" and that many Conservative Party members would be "reluctant to participate" in the vote.'Last game in town' Simon Hart, Conservative MP for Carmarthern West and South Pembrokeshire, said while he will continue to vote against a new public vote on Europe, "I can see how it would be the last game in town".He said: "The problem we have here is there are so many entrenched views that it's almost impossible to see how anything else can happen but an extended delay, and then we may be into leadership situations or even, much against my better judgement, into a situation where the only option left standing is around a confirmatory vote from the public because Parliament has failed in its duty to be able to resolve this."Earlier Wales' first minister Mark Drakeford said the assembly could be recalled if Mrs May's request for an extension fails.
Brexit donation: DUP received further £13,000 from CRC:::::Image caption The DUP previously received 435,000 as a donation from the CRC The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) accepted a further 13,000 donation from a pro-Brexit group in the months after the EU referendum, documents have confirmed.The Constitutional Research Council (CRC) had previously donated 435,000 to the DUP during the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign.The bulk of the 435,000 was spent by the DUP on pro-Brexit advertising.The DUP said it has complied with electoral law at all times.The party did not comment on how it spent the 13,000 donation but said it used donations to "further the cause of unionism at home and abroad".Image caption Richard Cook is a former vice-chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party The details on the latest CRC donation are contained in internal Electoral Commission documents published by the campaign group the Good Law Project.The CRC is thought to be a group of pro-union business people chaired by Richard Cook.Mr Cook is a former vice chairman of the Scottish Conservatives.BBC News NI contacted Mr Cook about the 13,000 donation to the DUP but he was unavailable for comment.The names of those who donated the money to the CRC have never been released.Donor laws in Northern Ireland state that the Electoral Commission cannot publish any donations made before July 2017.'Correctly declared' In February 2017, the DUP confirmed it received a 435,000 donation from the CRC as part of the EU referendum campaign.Image caption The DUP took out a wraparound ad in the Metro urging voters to "Take Back Control" Most of that money was spent on the Brexit campaign, including a four-page "Vote To Leave" advertisement in the Metro newspaper, which is available in London and other cities but not in Northern Ireland.The DUP reported the donation to the Electoral Commission but BBC News NI previously revealed that the CRC was fined 6,000 by the commission for failing to report the donation.Following an investigation, the CRC declared the donation and the commission found the source of the money was permissible.However, the latest batch of Electoral Commission documents confirm that the CRC gave the DUP a further 13,000 after the EU referendum.A donation of 6,000 was made in October 2016 and a further 7,000 was given in March 2017.Both donations were correctly declared to the Electoral Commission.'Extraordinary' The details of the 13,000 donation were contained in an assessment by the Electoral Commission of allegations made in a BBC NI Spotlight programme.It examined whether there was a common plan between the DUP and the referendum campaign group Vote Leave.Last August, the Electoral Commission announced it would not investigate the allegations contained in the programme, having made what it said was "a thorough review of the programme".Speaking to the Open Democracy website, some MPs have called on the Electoral Commission to re-open its investigation into the connections between Vote Leave and the DUP.Jolyon Maugham, from the Good Law Project, said it was "inevitable" that the Electoral Commission would need to re-examine donations to the DUP during the referendum campaign.He added: "It's extraordinary that - almost three years on - real questions remain."A DUP spokesperson said donations received by the party were reported to the Electoral Commission "in accordance with our legal obligations".
Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit?:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Andrew Fisher (centre) accompanied Mr McDonnell to the talks Cross-party talks are continuing in Whitehall, amid parliamentary deadlock over Theresa May's Brexit deal.So what are the sticking points and can Labour and the Conservatives reach an agreement?Public statements on the talks have tended to be bland, ranging from "constructive" and "serious" to the slightly more negative: "We have some way to travel."Behind the scenes, the prospect of a deal, while difficult, is not impossible.There is a big incentive for both sides to reach agreement: the avoidance of next month's European elections.Prime Minister Theresa May doesn't want to give a platform to parties such as Nigel Farage's new project which could appeal to Brexit-voting Conservatives.And, frankly, some of her own activists would be conflicted over how, or whether, to vote.For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, awkward questions about a second referendum could be ducked if there is no election campaign.So the talks are serious and not just political window dressing, and the fact that Mr Corbyn and Mrs May met on Thursday is significant.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Michael Gove is one of the Conservatives taking part in negotiations The Labour leader's policy guru Andrew Fisher joined shadow chancellor John McDonnell for the cross-party talks on Friday.But, as I understand it, significant hurdles remain.Some of the detail of possible changes to the Political Declaration - the blueprint for the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU - is being discussed.But sequencing is a problem.Labour wants to discuss legally binding changes to the document, future-proofing it, where possible, against a change of Conservative leader.Broadly speaking, the government would rather do "the easy bit" first - discussing legislation to protect workers' rights.Resolving this tension is key to a deal.Labour is also keen to secure agreement on a customs union.It is flexible on what it would be called - an "arrangement", for example - and Mrs May hinted on Thursday that the two sides were close on this.But they are not yet close enough.The definition of what a customs union/arrangement does is vital to the Labour side.But the main constraints to a deal may come from Mrs May and Mr Corbyn's parties, rather than their negotiators.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many Labour members want another referendum if agreement is reached If there is too much compromise on a customs union, Mrs May risks losing more cabinet ministers.For Mr Corbyn, the pressure from many Labour members is for him to exact a referendum, in return for passing the deal.So far, the prime minister isn't budging on this.One way round this obstacle would be to hold a separate vote in Parliament on a referendum, possibly as an amendment to the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn - who is not an enthusiast for a public vote - believe this would fall.But some of the Labour leader's shadow ministers - including some who are firmly on the Left - are pushing for a referendum, or confirmatory ballot, to be tied explicitly to any Brexit deal.So, getting a deal passed would be totally dependent on approving a public vote at the same time.I am told shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for a ballot to be part of any final package.If, in the end, these difficulties can't be overcome then the hope is that both sides will at least agree a parliamentary process for discussing and voting on options which might finally break the deadlock.

European elections: How the UK is gearing up for likelihood of polls:::::Image copyright PA Image caption UKIP topped the polls in 2014 but a lot has changed since then The UK's political parties are gearing up to fight elections to the European Parliament in six weeks' time.The planning needed to stage the polls on 23 May is under way, even though Theresa May still hopes the UK will have left the EU by then and they won't need to happen.As recently as the end of March, the prime minister said the public would find it "unacceptable" to have to elect a new group of 72 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU.But things have changed since then.Under terms agreed with EU leaders in Brussels, the UK has been given a Brexit extension until 31 October.The UK "must hold the elections to the European Parliament" and if it fails to do this, the UK will leave on 1 June without a deal.Given the political backdrop, they could turn out to be the most controversial and unpredictable European elections in UK history.How are the parties preparing?In short, in something of a hurry.The parties have to submit the names of the candidates representing them to the elections watchdog by 25 April or, in the case of the South West region, 24 hours earlier.MEPs are elected on a regional list basis, representing Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and nine English regions, using a system of proportional representation.If you want to know more about the European Parliament, the UK electoral process and the cost of staging the elections, read our Reality Check guide.While many Brexiteers are angry about the UK having to participate at all, believing it is a waste of time and money, the likelihood of any kind of boycott seems remote.Many now regard the poll as a proxy referendum on Brexit and the UK's future in the EU.UKIP leader Gerard Batten, whose party topped the 2014 poll, has launched a crowdfunding campaign and said the party's message would be one of "unilateral withdrawal" from the EU and "no surrender".How are candidates being selected?Image caption The leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament has said he will stand again Given the lack of time, the selection process is likely to be more truncated than usual.Labour is giving its existing MEPs preferential treatment by guaranteeing them spots at the top of each regional candidate list.As it stands, 16 of the 20 Labour MEPs elected in 2014 have applied to stand.Would-be Conservative candidates had until Tuesday 9 April to put themselves forward.The Conservative Home website said it was very unlikely all 18 incumbents would try again as many have been planning for life after Brexit.It queried whether the party would be able to fill all 70 spots on its respective lists with "candidates' WhatsApp groups full of jokes about the futility of taking part".The current leader of the Conservative group in the European Parliament, Ashley Fox, has confirmed he will be taking part and joked about the likely reception he could get on the doorsteps.The Liberal Democrats and the Green Party see the polls as an opportunity to make the case for continued EU membership, with the Greens vowing to "mobilise one of the strongest pro-EU movements ever".How much will the elections cost?The estimated cost of taking part in European Parliamentary elections has been given as up to 109m.This is based on the cost in 2014 which was 108.7m.What happened last time?The political landscape was very different the last time the European elections were held in 2014.The Conservatives and Lib Dems were governing in coalition and even though David Cameron had signalled his desire to hold an EU referendum if he won an overall majority, the prospect still seemed far off.But, with hindsight, the result could be seen to have been harbinger of things to come as UKIP topped the polls for the first ever time, winning nearly 27% of the vote and 24 seats.The party made its first proper electoral breakthrough a decade earlier when it won 15% of the vote and 12 seats in 2004's polls.European elections have historically been more fertile territory for anti-establishment parties, which have struggled to translate votes into seats in general elections because of the first-past-the-post system.The Conservatives and Labour are understandably nervous that this trend will continue if the polls go ahead.Will there be any new faces this time?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Same message, different party: Nigel Farage is heading the new Brexit Party after leaving UKIP For the past 20 years, UKIP has been the insurgent party in British politics but now it is facing a challenge from its former leader Nigel Farage, who has launched a rival outfit called the Brexit Party.Mr Farage, who will be standing as a candidate in the South East region, has vowed to "teach the establishment a lesson".The party, which will launch its campaign on Friday, is positioning itself as the real alternative to the Conservatives and Labour which it says have betrayed the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen is leading The Independent Group into the elections There is little love lost between Mr Farage and Mr Batten after the latter appointed anti-Islam campaigner Tommy Robinson as an adviser.There are reports the ex-English Defence League leader could play some kind of role in UKIP's campaign.Eurosceptic voters are likely to have a plethora of choice in May's polls, with other parties set to stand including Our Nation, an entity formed last year by the short-lived UKIP leader Henry Bolton.The prospect of a possible realignment is not confined to the right of British politics.The breakaway Independent Group of former Labour and Tory MPs are hoping to field a substantial number of candidates if their application to become a political party is accepted by the Electoral Commission.They hope to fight the election as Change UK - The Independent Group, on a platform of seeking another referendum on the terms of Brexit, with the option to remain.Interim leader, ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen, has said the poll is a "real opportunity" to build a new political movement, suggesting the public is crying out "for someone to lead and say we can just stay".What will happen after the elections?How long any UK MEPs get to stay in Brussels and Strasbourg is anyone's guess at this stage.The new European Parliament is set to reassemble in early July, and the Brexit extension is due to run up to 31 October.It is no longer beyond the realms of possibility that UK politicians and their staff, who only recently were contemplating a future outside the European Parliament, will find themselves there.
Brexit: What happens now?:::::The EU and UK have agreed a further delay to Brexit until 31 October.So how will the deadlock be broken?The UK could leave earlier if a withdrawal agreement has been ratified by MPs.The country must now take part in European elections on 23 May - if it did not the UK would have to leave the EU on 1 June without a deal.The UK was originally due to leave on 29 March.The first extension shifted that date to 12 April.But now the UK now has just over six months to decide what it wants to do.Government ministers are continuing talks with Labour leaders to try to find a compromise deal.If they can agree, MPs will be given a chance to vote on the deal.If not, a range of alternative options will be put to them instead.In either case, the prime minister says the negotiated withdrawal agreement would remain unchanged.That's the legally binding part of the Brexit deal that covers exit terms - including money, the transition period, citizen's rights and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.There could be changes to the non-legally binding political declaration which sets out parameters for the long-term future relationship.Or new commitments on Britain's future negotiating objectives could be written into legislation.The government is still committed to trying to leave the EU with a deal as soon as possible.But if the compromise plan does not yield results, many things could happen.1.No deal No-deal Brexit is still the default outcome if MPs can't agree anything else and there are no further extensions.If Parliament can't agree a deal soon and the UK does not take part in the European elections on 23 May then a no-deal Brexit would happen on 1 June.If the elections do take place then the next deadline is now 31 October.It would also be possible for MPs to back a no-deal Brexit - although there has been a majority against that option when they have voted on it before.2.Leave the EU on the PM's deal Despite the repeated rejection of Theresa May's deal, it has not been permanently ruled out.Even now, if a compromise cannot be agreed with the Labour leader, and if there is no majority among MPs for an alternative, it remains a possibility.And with the longer Brexit delay now in place, the negotiated deal could come back at a later date as a way of allowing an early exit.Also, if negotiations with the EU on any alternative plan run into difficulties, the two sides could decide to return to the one deal that has been fully worked out.3.Major renegotiation The government could choose to negotiate a completely new Brexit deal - perhaps in accordance with votes of MPs.This wouldn't be a question of making small additions to the political declaration.Instead, there could be a complete renegotiation that would take some time - perhaps involving a rewrite of the withdrawal agreement which would take much longer.If the EU refused to re-enter negotiations, the government would have to plump for one of the other options instead.4.Another referendum A further possibility is to hold another referendum.It could have the same status as the 2016 referendum, which was legally non-binding and advisory.But some MPs want to hold a binding referendum where the result would automatically take effect - like with the 2011 referendum on changing the voting system for UK general elections.One widely discussed option would be for a "confirmatory vote" on whatever deal is finally agreed where the public would be given the choice between accepting the deal or remaining in the EU.Others argue that any further referendum should have the option of leaving the EU without a deal.Either way, a referendum can't just happen automatically.The rules for referendums are set out in a law called the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.There would have to be a new piece of legislation to make a referendum happen and to determine the rules, such as who would be allowed to vote.It couldn't be rushed through, because there has to be time for the Electoral Commission to consider and advise on the referendum question.The question is then defined in the legislation.Once the legislation has been passed, the referendum couldn't happen immediately either.There would have to be a statutory "referendum period" before the vote takes place.Experts at University College London's Constitution Unit suggest that the minimum time for all of the required steps above is about 22 weeks.5.Call a general election Theresa May could decide the best way out of the deadlock would be to hold an early general election.She doesn't have the power just to call an election.But, as in 2017, she could ask MPs to vote for an early election under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.Two-thirds of all MPs would need to support the move.The earliest date for the election would be 25 working days later but it could be after that - the prime minister would choose the precise date.6.Another no-confidence vote The government survived a vote of no confidence on 16 January by 325 votes to 306.Labour could table another no confidence motion at any time.Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years.The next one is due in 2022.But a vote of no confidence lets MPs vote on whether they want the government to continue.The motion must be worded: "That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government."If a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown.If during that time the current government or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence, then an early general election would be called.That election cannot happen for at least 25 working days.7.No Brexit The European Court of Justice has ruled that it would be legal for the UK to unilaterally revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit (without the need for agreement from the other 27 EU countries).With the government still committed to Brexit, it's very likely that a major event such as a further referendum or change of government would have to happen before such a move.It's not totally clear what the process would be.But an act of Parliament calling for Article 50 to be revoked would probably be sufficient.Other possibilities Theresa May has said she will step down if her deal is passed.Having already survived a challenge to her leadership, there is no way she can be forced out by her party until December - under the Conservative Party rules.But she could still choose to resign if she can't get her deal through and she's not prepared to change course.That would trigger a Conservative leadership campaign which would result in the appointment of a new prime minister.She might also come under pressure to resign if MPs pass a "censure motion" - that would be a bit like a no-confidence vote but without the same automatic consequences.Again this could lead to a change in prime minister or even a change in government.Whoever ended up in charge would still face the same basic range of Brexit options though.
Brexit: How do European elections work?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The European Union (EU) has agreed a Brexit delay until the end of October and preparations have started to take part in the European elections on 23 May.Prime Minister Theresa May says if a deal gets through Parliament before that date, the UK will not participate.But it seems likely that the UK will still be in the EU at that point.What is the European Parliament?The European Parliament is directly elected by EU voters.It is responsible, along with the Council of Ministers from member states, for making laws and approving budgets.It also plays a role in the EU's relations with other countries, including those wishing to join the bloc.Its members represent the interests of different countries and different regions within the EU.How are its members elected?Every five years, EU countries go to the polls to elect members of the European Parliament (MEPs).Each country is allocated a set number of seats, roughly depending on the size of its population.The smallest, Malta (population: around half a million) has six members sitting in the European Parliament while the largest, Germany (population: 82 million) has 96.At the moment there are 751 MEPs in total and the UK has 73.Candidates can stand as individuals or they can stand as representatives of one of the UK's political parties.Once elected, they represent different regions of the country, again according to population.The north-east of England and Northern Ireland have three MEPs each while the south-east of England, including London, has 18.While most UK MEPs are also members of a national party, once in the European Parliament they sit in one of eight political groups which include MEPs from across the EU who share the same political affiliation.Member states can run elections to the European Parliament according to their own national laws and traditions, but they must stick to some common rules.MEPs must be elected using a system of proportional representation - so, for example, a party which gains a third of the votes wins a third of the seats.Turnout in the UK for European Parliament elections is low both by EU standards and by the standards of other UK elections.The last time they were held in 2014, 36% of those eligible to vote did so, compared with 43% in the EU as a whole.That compares with 66% turnout at the following year's general election.In 2016, 56% of the electorate voted in the Scottish Parliament elections, 45% in the Welsh Assembly and 54% in the Northern Ireland Assembly.In local elections in England, turnout varies depending largely on what other elections are taking place on the same day, sometimes dipping as low as the European elections turnout and sometimes rising close to the level of general elections.Elections to European Parliament How much do elections cost?The last time European elections were held in 2014, the UK spent 109m on them.The main costs were running the poll itself (securing polling stations and venues to run counts) and mailing out candidate information and polling cards.The government has said that if the UK does not end up participating in the 2019 elections, it will reimburse local returning officers - the people responsible for running elections - for any expenses already paid.What happens if the UK leaves?The EU is planning to reduce the overall number of seats in the parliament from 751 to 705 when the UK leaves.There will be a reallocation of 27 of the UK's seats to 14 other member states that are currently underrepresented.And the rest will be set aside with the possibility of being allocated to any new member states that join in the future.The EU has already passed legislation to do this, but it does not take effect until the UK leaves.The number of seats is capped in law at 751.The European Commission had advised that as long as the UK made a decision to take part in the European elections by mid-April, this reallocation would be reversed.But what if the UK elects MEPs and then passes a deal to leave the EU?In that case, the UK MEPs would not take their seats, leaving vacancies.The House of Commons Library says that extra MEPs could potentially be elected on "stand-by" in some member states but not take up their seats until the UK leaves the EU.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit Halloween deadline spooks Europe's newspapers:::::The flexible Brexit extension until Halloween given to the UK by EU leaders prompts a spirited response from Europe's papers.But it's what the wrangling in Brussels means for EU unity ahead of European Parliament elections next month that preoccupies many in the media.For France's Le Monde, it's a "Halloween Brexit... due on 31 October, the Anglo-Saxon holiday of pumpkins and witches".It says President Emmanuel Macron backed Prime Minister Theresa May's request for a short delay until 30 June but "was forced to compromise".The leaders finally split the difference with a typically European compromise: "they cut the pumpkin in half".France's Libration believes the extension came at the cost of breaking the united front of EU leaders."This increasingly incomprehensible waltz of dates shows that the UK has succeeded in exporting its byzantine internal battles to Brussels.For this summit broke to pieces the nice, united European front which held together, for better or for worse, for three years."Libration says the 27 EU leaders have raised the risk of "allowing the British to weigh in on the choice of the future presidents of the EU Commission, Parliament, European Council and the European Central Bank, as well as on discussions regarding the 2020 budget and financial prospects for 2021-2027"."Which is to say, they are giving London a capacity for nuisance which it could not have dared dream of."Image copyright Liberation Germany's Die Welt agrees the effect of Brexit is that "the alliance of the 27 member states is crumbling"."The diverging 'Brexit philosophy' in Paris and Berlin is obvious.With his hard line towards London, Macron wants to scare populists in his own country about similar anti-EU plans.Berlin, on the other hand, sees long-term damage in a lacking willingness to compromise, which could truly bring the populists onto the scene."In the Netherlands, Algemeen Dagblad says Europe is in a very difficult position."Everybody agrees that a no-deal Brexit is undesirable for all parties The EU, facing the prospect of European parliamentary elections in May, does not want to be perceived as the bad guy dropping the UK into misery."Other papers take a very tough tone towards Britain.Barcelona-based La Vanguardia says: "The extension discussed through an intense debate at an informal summit in Brussels is the second one and should be final.The British decided to leave the EU by their own volition," in a post-summit editorial headlined "Brexit and the patience of the EU".In Italy, there's recognition of the EU's tough choices.For Il Sole 24 Ore, "the 27 want to rule out a dramatic, hard Brexit, but they also want to avoid Britain's permanence in the Union, one foot in and the other out, impacting on European affairs".An alternative take that cannot be allowed to slip through the net comes from Patrick Smyth in the Irish Times who warns of the very real threat of a no-eel Brexit.He's talking about the transhipment of live species - in this case eels from Lough Erne in Northern Ireland - to the Republic, and the broader point of importing animal-based food products into the EU.Image copyright The Irish Times "It is true that the fate of the eels can be said to be small beer compared with the impact on the Irish economy of a no-deal Brexit.But it is an illustration of the breadth of the potential impact."While the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit may have receded, he says, "we may well be back all too shortly facing up for real to a dreadful prospect in which, among other issues of greater import, the fate of eels and ham sandwiches will again be on the order of the day."BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.
The hustings to be our next prime minister, in all but name:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Matt Hancock and Penny Mordaunt were on the panel Nowhere in the official billing for this event did the word "hustings" appear, but it had the distinct feel of just that.Conservatives gathered in a room in Parliament dripping with history, to talk about the future.The wallpaper in the Jubilee Room was designed by a bloke who died in 1852 - Augustus Pugin.The people there had designs on the 2020s and beyond.And, perhaps, on leading us into that decade.This was a gathering organised by the Tory think tank Onward - which presented research concluding that age is the new dividing line in British politics and the Conservatives are appealing to fewer and fewer younger people.The research is stark.Onward's report said 83% of Conservative voters are now over the age of 45 and just 4% are under the age of 24 years old."The 'tipping point age' - the median age at which a voter is more likely to be Conservative than Labour - is now 51 years old, up from 47 at the 2017 general election."Before the 2017 campaign, the tipping point was 34 years old," it adds.The brand is so toxic among many younger women, the organisers said, the party did not even "pass rudimentary hygiene" tests for them.Add to that, they said, the UK was urbanising, and people who moved to cities tended to become more left wing, "shifting the soul of the Conservative Party from Kensington to North Yorkshire".No denials Among those listening to the presentation are two cabinet ministers, teased by everyone else as leadership contenders when Theresa May stands down as prime minister.When the words were uttered, there was the odd awkward shuffle or looking down at notes from International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.But no denial.And both agreed the central conclusions of the research amounted to a "kick up the arse" for the Conservative Party.Incidentally, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Tom Tugendhat, was also on the discussion panel - although he suggested others were contenders rather than him.Image copyright AFP Image caption Tom Tugendhat also attended the event The pitch from Mr Hancock, who voted Remain, but said Brexit had to be delivered, went like this: "I'd like to change the subject."We need to talk about everything else.Not just Brexit.We need to look and feel like a party that is a champion of modern Britain."We can do that without changing the name.You can do it by providing the policies, the tone and the subject matter."Signs of contest to come Yes, Brexit was the elephant in the room, acknowledged as it had to be, while it was universally hoped that one day, eventually, it might be possible for politicians to actually talk about other stuff.Environment Secretary Michael Gove had hoped to do just that here, but pulled out at the last minute because, you guessed it, he was negotiating with Labour about Brexit.Ms Mordaunt voted Leave, but went out of her way to appeal to some who had voted in the opposite direction to her: "Those who, in my view, showed the greatest act of patriotism over the last few years weren't Leave voters."It was Remain voters who accepted the result."Because believe it or not they have faith in this institution and in our democratic traditions.And at times like this we are testing those institutions to the absolute limit."Classic signs of the contest to come were there to be witnessed.Mr Hancock appeared to address the camera at the back of the room, rather than those of us gathered within it.Ms Mordaunt started her spiel with the story of Femi, a disabled computer coder, aged 11.A classic of political communication - grounding a message in the story of an individual they have met.This was a party asking serious questions about the future, and its place within it.But it also amounted to this: pre-season training for the competition to come.The first evidence, in public, of the contest that awaits us.The battle to be our next prime minister.
Unhappiness with politics 'at 15-year high':::::Image copyright PA Image caption Politicians are now less trusted to act in the public interest than bankers The public's dissatisfaction with how government is working is at a 15-year high, an influential study of political engagement suggests.Levels of unhappiness are now greater than in the wake of the MPs' expenses scandal, the Hansard Society found.More than half of the 1,200 people questioned thought the UK was in decline and needed a "strong leader who is willing to break the rules".And more than 40% said they could support new parties with radical ideas.The Hansard Society's 16th Audit of Political Engagement was carried out in early December, before the extent of the current Commons deadlock over Brexit became apparent.But it found that MPs were less trusted to handle Brexit than judges and civil servants, while banks were more trusted to act in the public interest than MPs, ministers or political parties.The survey of 1,198 adults, carried out by Ipsos-Mori, found falling levels of confidence in the political system and the belief that the public can influence decision-making and change the country for the better.'Room for improvement' The proportion of respondents who believed the system of government required either "quite a lot" or a "great deal" of improvement rose above 70% for the first time - to 72%.This was 12 points higher than when the annual research first took place in 2004 and three points higher than in 2010 - when it hit 69% in the aftermath of the furore over MPs' expenses claims.Institutions and individuals both came in for their share of blame.Nearly 40% of respondents agreed that "neither the system nor the people making the decisions" were good enough, as opposed to 15% who said the people in power were good but the "system prevents them from making the right decisions".On Brexit, 79% of respondents had little or no confidence in political parties' ability to sort it out, while 75% said they were too divided to act in the national interest.Confidence levels in civil servants and judges were higher, at 40% and 49% respectively, than for individual MPs (25%) and ministers (26%).'Important questions' While one in three of those questioned still considered themselves to be a "fairly or very strong" supporter of an established political party, 43% said they would consider backing parties with radical ideas which had not been in power before.Some 54% said they agreed that the UK needed "a strong leader willing to break the rules" - against 23% who disagreed.And 42% of respondents said they believed many of the UK's problems could be dealt with more effectively if the government did not have to worry so much about votes in Parliament.While support for referendums to solve big political questions has declined sharply since 2016, 55% of those questioned still had faith in them as opposed to 39% who did not.Ruth Fox, director of the Hansard Society, said the findings raised "some pretty important questions about how people feel about our democracy at the moment"."We are seeing some anti-democratic sentiments coming through, through the frustration that the public have got with the politicians and the parties," she told the BBC's Politics Live.On a more positive note, she said core indicators of engagement - such as certainty to vote and interest and knowledge of politics - remained stable at average or above-average levels compared with previous years.The survey found 80% of those who voted Remain in the 2016 referendum were "absolutely certain" to vote again in a future referendum or election, compared with 64% of Leave voters.
Council elections: Why don't people vote?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Council elections: Why don't two thirds of people vote?People are being urged to register to vote in the local elections by 12 April, but only about a third use their ballot.What is putting them off?More than 8,000 local councillors up and down England are being elected to 248 councils on 2 May, with the power to decide and scrutinise policy and spending on everything from bin collections to protecting vulnerable children.Yet turnout in local elections has been low for years.Just over one in three registered voters actually took part in the elections in 2018 and there were some areas where it was barely one in four.In Hartlepool, just over 24% of the 70,455 registered voters returned a ballot.This includes spoiled and rejected papers.The council holds elections three years out of every four, with 11 of its 33 seats up for the vote each time.Even in the areas where turnout was highest, only one council - Richmond-upon-Thames - saw more than half of people cast a vote.And of the 10 areas with the highest turnouts in 2018, six are not holding elections this year.Why don't some people vote?Voters in Hartlepool's Manor House ward, where just over 16% of voters turned out in 2018, told the BBC it was a mixture of apathy, a belief that nothing would change, disillusionment with national and local politics and having "no one party that sticks out" Rachael Farrington, founder of Voting Counts - a campaign to encourage voters to register - said: "Many of the people we speak to feel there is a disconnect between politics and their everyday lives.Everyone has issues they care about, from local planning and leisure facilities to bin collections and schools, but it can be difficult to identify how local councils operate and affect these issues."There is also little national attention paid to the role councils and councillors play in communities.While national politics continues to dominate headlines it can appear that change can only happen via Westminster - and those making decisions at a local level are neglected of the due attention, and scrutiny, they deserve."Do we have too many elections?The official data shows turnout improves dramatically when voting takes place on the same day as a General Election and people are choosing their MPs and the government.In 2017, the snap general election was not held until a month after the local elections and turnout in the council vote stayed about a third.Almost four out of 10 councils holding elections on 2 May elect their councillors by "thirds".This means they hold an election for one third of their councillors three years out of every four, rather than putting everyone up for the vote at once.Jess Garland of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) said frequent elections where not a lot changed could put people off."There's not one big election day where everyone comes out and there's a large buzz," she said, "but there is a lot that can and must be done to ensure every voice is heard and every vote counts."The ERS has also criticised the voting system, saying the "one-person-takes-all" system made people feel like they had to vote tactically and led to "too many safe seats"."When you have one party dominating in an area it can be hugely off-putting, with many people feeling like their votes don't count and it's not worth turning out," Ms Garland said.Why should you vote?Getty Local elections 2019 What's at stake on 2 May 8,402 Council seats up for election 248local authorities 5 directly elected council mayors 1combined authority mayor Source: Electoral Commission Michael Sani from the campaign group Bite The Ballot said: "Local government decides what they do with the money provided to them by central government."This means it is crucial to vote in these elections in order to have a say on your local community.Voting in local elections also sends a message to the national parties that you are active and they can no longer overlook your needs and priorities."Ms Farrington added: "Your local council has an impact on many of the services you see and use every day, including housing, transport and public spaces and services.Choices made by the council will have visible impacts on your community, so engaging in local elections is the best way to have your say over who is making these decisions."Local councils set the rates of council tax for your area, these rates have a direct impact on your income as well as the services in your area."Councillors represent a much smaller group of people than MPs do, that means your single vote is more likely to make an impact on the result."You may also be interested in: Who can vote?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption #Dogsatpollingstations always gets people talking on Twitter but only a third of people vote in council elections To vote in local elections a person must be registered to vote, 18 years or over on polling day and also be: A British citizen, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of the EU Resident in the UK Not subject to a legal incapacity to vote, such as serving prisoners The Electoral Commission has been running a campaign on social media to encourage people to register by the deadline of Friday 12 April, even attempting to drum up interest by using the hashtag #dogsatpollingstations, which has become popular in recent years with people sharing photographs of their dogs when they go to vote.Chris Hinde from the Electoral Commission said: "It only takes five minutes to register to vote online - time that you might otherwise spend waiting for the kettle to boil or a bus to arrive.So if you want to make sure your voice is heard, go online and register now."
Extinction Rebellion: Saving the world or wasting police time?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Extinction Rebellion's fight against climate change is making headlines Protest group Extinction Rebellion's fight against climate change is making headlines - most recently when they stripped almost naked in the House of Commons.The Victoria Derbyshire programme went behind the scenes with the group, which urges people to break the law to save the world."Troublemakers change the world," says Roger Hallam, one the group's founders."When they're starting to call you troublemakers, you're starting to get some traction, right?"Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible.Since its launch last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament.Critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.Mr Hallam is unrepentant: "If you're a trade union, everyone knows that when you first go on strike everyone's going, 'Troublemakers.'But then you have to state your case, which is, 'If you don't get this sorted, we're going to die.'"We filmed members as they blocked traffic in central London - playing cat and mouse with the police - and as young members glued themselves to the entrance of a fracking conference.Civil disobedience Image caption Group founder Roger Hallam says he has spent years studying how to achieve social change It has three core demands: for the government to "tell the truth about climate change", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress.Mr Hallam has spent years researching how to achieve social change through radical movements."Mass participation and civil disobedience maximise the chance of social change in this context," he explains."It doesn't mean it's guaranteed, it just means it's massively more likely to be effective than sending emails and doing conventional campaigning.And it's significantly more effective than using violence."He estimates that thousands of people will need to be arrested before the government will take notice.So far, 222 people have been arrested for offences relating to the protests."The police will go to government and say, 'We're not doing it anymore,'" says Mr Hallam."They're not there to start arresting 84-year-old grannies or 10-year-old kids, there has to be a political solution."Non-violent Image caption The group was given its office in London by a supporter The group's headquarters is in a slightly unexpected spot, the top of a corporate building in Euston which also houses a construction company and a fashion brand.It was given to them after one of their members approached a corporate landlord and said: "We're not going to be around in 10 years, let us do something about it."He gave it to them, in effect, for free.At a training event for new joiners, a debate is held on what counts as violence - Extinction Rebellion is a non-violent organisation.In a role-play exercise, they learn how to deal with angry members of the public - the people they are often obstructing during protests.They are also taught what to do when they are arrested - how to make it more difficult for police to pick them up and their legal rights once they get to the police station.Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger The Taxpayers' Alliance says their behaviour is "clearly irresponsible and wasting police time".The campaign group's chief executive John O'Connell said: "They should stop these juvenile actions and express themselves peaceably, and not resort to playground politics."Does Extinction Rebellion really think ruining people's day by blocking their way is going to change their minds?"Yes, it is," says Mr Hallam."The only way people change is by getting upset.No change is possible unless there's major emotional distress.And you can do that violently and non-violently... it's a no-brainer, that's how society changes."No arrests?Image caption Lorna Greenwood says traditional forms of campaigning are not working At their Downing Street demonstration, which they have called Blood of our Children because they are covering the street with fake blood, 31-year-old Lorna Greenwood is demonstrating with the group for the first time."I don't want to be standing here, six months pregnant, breaking the law," she tells the crowd."I don't want to spend my weekend in a police cell, and I don't want to be giving more work to our overstretched and undervalued police force.But I don't feel like I have any other options."In fact, there are no arrests during this demonstration - the police do not always give the group the results it hopes."The whole point is to get arrested - I've come from Manchester to get arrested," says one disappointed man.But there are journalists everywhere which is also what the group wants - the press covering them and telling people they exist.Later this month, the group plans to blockade London in its biggest action yet - it says its members will sit in the streets until politicians listen.Farhana Yamin, an international climate change lecturer and environmental lawyer, is one of the people prepared to be arrested for the cause.She explains: "I've got four kids and the eldest one, every year she gets older and I feel, 'Where's the progress?'All that time I spent as a lawyer and a professional away from her, what does that count for?"Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter -

Brexit: What are EU countries doing to prepare for no deal?:::::Political deadlock remains over Brexit because Theresa May cannot get her deal through Parliament.The UK government has stepped up its planning for leaving the EU without a deal, covering areas such as transport, healthcare, energy, food and water.What is the EU doing to prepare for this scenario?European Commission The European Commission has set out its readiness for the "increasingly likely" chances of no deal.It covers basic arrangements for road hauliers, flights and financial services.The Commission reiterated that these would not replicate the conditions of EU membership and said that it would be "required to immediately apply its rules and tariffs at its borders".The document, however, did not mention what would happen to the Irish border.The Commission has a website which links to advice from all of the EU member countries.Here are summaries of the measures taken by some of them.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The 499km (310-mile) Northern Ireland border would be hard to police Ireland The Republic of Ireland has been preparing for Brexit for a long time.It's clear that a no-deal Brexit would raise serious questions for the Irish economy.Ireland passed no deal Brexit legislation in February, which covers a number of important issues such as allowing for pension and other benefits to be paid, for cross-border rail and bus services to continue and for citizens to access services across the border as they do now.But, the most important issue - the future of the land border with Northern Ireland - does not feature in the legislation.Ireland, the UK and the EU all say they want to avoid any physical infrastructure at the border.But an EU official said checks on goods would need to be done and the EU and Ireland were working on carrying them out away from the border.In the event of no deal, the EU would add new shipping links between Ireland and ports in France, Belgium and the Netherlands; the EU says funding for this would be a priority in its budget.The Irish government has plans to expand port infrastructure in Dublin and Rosslare, to allow inspections of trucks arriving from the UK and of live animals, and to accommodate extra staff.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption France is creating extra facilities in Calais, a vital hub for trade with the UK France The French customs service has been preparing for Brexit for some time and is planning to recruit 700 extra staff by the end of 2020.It has also produced detailed online information for businesses with advice on transporting live animals, fish, chemical products, medicines and waste.France is spending 50m (43m) on expanding port infrastructure to accommodate additional officials and customs checks.If there is no deal, new border inspection posts will be needed to check food, plants and live animals.For veterinary checks, 117 new inspectors have already been trained after a fast-track programme and are ready to take up their posts.The majority will be based in Calais.The French parliament passed a law in January to give the government (rather than parliament) the power to introduce new measures by emergency decree to cope with a no-deal Brexit.The law covers, among other things, the rights of UK nationals living and working in France.Further advice for citizens and companies is available on the French government's website.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption German VWs bound for export: they could face 10% tariffs in the UK under no-deal Germany Germany has produced less detailed public information than France, which has led to some frustration among business leaders and opposition parties.The German government has a special Brexit cabinet, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.It says it is well prepared for all eventualities.Behind the scenes, Germany is making many of the same preparations as France, including the recruitment of 900 extra customs staff.In areas of social security, tax issues and financial services, the German government has initiated new legislation with the aim of creating legal certainty if there is no deal.But the government says its biggest priority is protecting the interests of citizens on both sides of the Channel.In the event of no deal, the government would give British citizens living in Germany an initial period of three months during which their rights to live and work there would not change.However, they would have to apply for residence permits during that period.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rotterdam handles a vast amount of cargo going to and from the UK The Netherlands The Dutch have been busy.Last year the government said more than 900 customs officials and an extra 145 vets would be needed for the Port of Rotterdam.The foreign ministry has published a no-deal Brexit impact document which says that this outcome would be "accompanied by disruptions and problems".It says 321 customs officials are ready to be deployed as well as an extra 14 border guards to carry out checks on UK nationals entering the country.The main international airport, Schiphol, will have more than 100 extra customs staff.UK passport holders will face stricter checks, the airport says.Some 10.5m people fly between Schiphol and the UK every year.British nationals and their family members who were legally resident in the Netherlands before the UK's departure would retain their right to live, study and work in the Netherlands for 15 months, through a temporary residence permit.The government estimated that around 45,000 British nationals and their family members currently have residence rights, with around 20,000 of them working in the Netherlands.British students already studying in the Netherlands will be able to continue on the same terms as before, but anyone planning to study there after a no-deal Brexit will have to pay much higher tuition fees.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An Ostend fish stall: Brexit means extra food inspections in Belgium Belgium An extra 141 customs officers are being deployed in the port cities of Ghent, Antwerp and Zeebrugge to cope with the impact of Brexit.Antwerp, Europe's second-biggest port, currently has 3,400 customs staff.The greatest impact is expected in Zeebrugge, as 45% of the port's traffic is with the UK.Belgium's government says it will maintain current rights for UK nationals - residence and social security - until the end of 2020, and the same goes for their tax status.Belgium's national food safety authority AFSCA will recruit 300 extra staff in the event of no deal, to check food going to and from the UK.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Spain wants to minimise any Brexit harm to its vital tourist industry Spain Spain has announced it needs an additional 860 employees for airports and ports to carry out checks on people, goods and animals.But, as in many other countries, the issue of citizens' rights is the most pressing one.On 1 March, Spain's cabinet approved temporary measures for Britons in Spain to continue living there as now, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.Under the measures, which will become law if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, Britons living in Spain would have to apply for the "foreigner identity card" before 31 December 2020, to prove their legal residency status.More than 300,000 UK nationals are officially resident in Spain - the highest number in Europe, outside the UK.There are many pensioners among the UK nationals in Spain.The Spanish measures include healthcare provisions, stating that the current conditions will continue provided the UK government reciprocates for Spaniards living in the UK.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gibraltar remains a thorny issue between Spain and the UK Gibraltar The Spanish plans would also cover Gibraltar, although certain additional provisions may apply, including Spain's power of veto over issues relating to the British Overseas Territory in any future agreement between the UK and the EU.An estimated 9,000 Spanish citizens work in Gibraltar, and the Madrid government says the measures would be contingent on them receiving the same rights as British citizens.The Government of Gibraltar's no-deal planning has been focused on possible delays at the border with Spain, which is crossed by thousands of people every day.It has also issued a number of notices with advice to citizens on healthcare, driving, studying, financial services, mobile phone roaming and other issues.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: Why a long extension worries Europe:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May met Angela Merkel in Berlin ahead of the EU summit The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has urged European Union leaders not to humiliate Theresa May when they discuss her latest request to delay Brexit.But the other 27 EU countries (known as the EU27) may still impose tough conditions on any extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, to ensure that they protect their own interests.So what do they have in mind?The EU's main initial demand is that the UK fulfils its commitment to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May, if Brexit hasn't happened by then.Draft conclusions for today's summit in Brussels say that if the UK were to fail to hold the elections, it would automatically leave the EU - without a deal if necessary - on 1 June.But even if those elections take place, and UK MEPs attend the first session of the new parliament in July, there is still concern in some quarters that a disgruntled British government could prevent the EU making progress on a series of important issues.Different member states have different opinions on how serious a threat this is.But it is certainly an important part of the discussion.Theresa May has already pledged that the UK will remain a "constructive and responsible" member state, and abide by its "duty of sincere co-operation" with the rest of the EU.This is a form of words that carries weight in Brussels, but it doesn't bind any future UK government to act in the same way.What else is on the EU's mind?The EU has a series of big decisions to make in the coming months.It doesn't want Brexit to get in the way.To begin with, there is a changing of the guard at the top of the EU's political structures.A new president of the European Commission has to be nominated by EU leaders, and approved by the European Parliament, in time to take over on 1 November from Jean-Claude Juncker, who is standing down.A month later, on 1 December, a new European Council president will take office, succeeding Donald Tusk.Both of these appointment, though, involve qualified majority voting - in other words they don't have to be approved unanimously by all member states.That would limit the ability of an unhappy UK government to block critical EU business."We've looked very carefully," a senior EU official says, "and in reality there aren't many things you can veto over the coming year."But there are other important issues looming for the EU notably on the size and shape of the next seven year budget for 2021-27.Negotiations on the budget will start to intensify under the new Commission, although final decisions won't be made for at least a year.The budget does need unanimous approval.That is one of the reasons why any Brexit extension will almost certainly, as Mr Tusk has suggested, be "no longer than a year".Brexit has been taking up far too much time already.It has diverted the EU from a focus on other subjects, and the leaders of the EU27 would rather concentrate on their own future than on the internal debates of a country that is trying to leave.So the leaders will have to decide how many conditions they impose on a Brexit extension, and they will want to hear Mrs May repeat her written pledge of co-operation in person.Throughout the Brexit process, the unity of the EU27 has been a consistent factor.But there is now a difficult balance to strike.Does there need to be a formal review process during an extension, or is a European Council decision to "remain seized of the matter" (EU jargon for paying close attention to it) enough?"I think the extension should be as short as possible," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the German parliament."But it should be long enough to create calm, so we don't have to meet every two weeks to talk about the same subject," she added.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
No-deal Brexit: What is the UK government doing to prepare?:::::Image copyright Gareth Fuller/PA Image caption A section of the M20 had been reserved exclusively for lorries as part of no-deal Brexit plans The European Union (EU) has agreed to the UK's request for a further Brexit delay.Under the new timetable, the UK's scheduled departure from the EU is now 31 October 2019 - seven months after the original deadline.Despite this extra time being granted, the UK government says it will "continue to make all necessary preparations" for a no-deal Brexit.This follows reports that official planning for that scenario was being stood down.The government adds that plans "will evolve and adapt" but will not stop, while the chance of leaving the EU without an agreement remains.So what are the government's no-deal contingency plans?Operation Yellowhammer The government's no-deal Brexit contingency plan is code-named Operation Yellowhammer, after a species of bird.First launched in June 2018, it covers 12 areas including transport, healthcare, energy, food and water.It is based on worst-case scenario assumptions - delays at the border over a six-month period, increased immigration checks at EU border posts, reduction in choice and availability of food, and potential price increases for utilities, food and fuel.Operation Yellowhammer isn't the government's only Brexit contingency plan, but sits alongside broader preparations.This is to "reflect the fact that it would not be possible for departments to plan for every eventuality", according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO), and that the government would need a way of taking control and quickly coordinating different agencies to handle any short-term disruption.Through Operation Yellowhammer, the government has been looking at what existing powers it could use to prioritise fuel to essential services or to relax rules limiting the working hours of HGV drivers, for example.As part the contingency plans, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has made 3,500 troops, including reserves, available to be deployed if necessary.It has also set up an operations room in a bunker at its main Whitehall building to coordinate efforts in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The MoD will not comment on exactly what role the troops could perform, only that they will "support government planning".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May talking to soldiers.The MoD says 3,500 troops will be available to be deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit if necessary In its report on Yellowhammer, published in March, the NAO said some no-deal preparations might not be ready in time.For example, the report said the government did not have enough time to put in place all of the infrastructure, systems and people required for fully effective border operations on day one.The cost of Yellowhammer is part of the 1.5bn allocated by the Treasury to government departments for Brexit preparations.For Yellowhammer to be effective, the NAO says that the "command, control and coordination" structure needs to be in place ahead of the UK leaving the EU.The Cabinet Office refused to tell the BBC whether Operation Yellowhammer was already underway ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit on 12 April.It said it would not provide a running commentary.But what about the government's broader no-deal Brexit plans?Healthcare The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says thousands of medicines have been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU.Suppliers are stockpiling an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual "buffer" stock.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Plans are in place to ensure there is enough essential medicines like insulin The same approach is being taken with vaccines as well as blood and transplant products.The DHSC has also agreed contracts for extra warehouse space with refrigeration capacity to store these supplies.A plane has been chartered to fly in medicines which have short shelf-lives and cannot be stockpiled, like medical radioisotopes used in cancer treatment.Transport The government has previously warned "there could be some freight traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no-deal Brexit".That's because under a no-deal scenario, lorries travelling between the UK and the EU will need to complete custom declarations.On top of this, certain goods from the UK, such as food and plant products, arriving at EU ports may also require physical checks, under EU single market rules.The Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day and the worry is that extra checks could lead to bottlenecks, leading to many miles of tailbacks.Independent modelling has estimated that two minutes of extra processing time for each lorry would lead to tailbacks of 17 miles.To avoid significant disruption, Operation Brock is the name of the plan to hold up to 2,000 lorries heading for mainland Europe in a queue while keeping other traffic flowing around it (ie a contraflow system).A fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time.If further capacity was still required, a "last resort" would be to turn the M26 into a temporary lorry park.The M26 is a 10-mile motorway connecting the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20, near West Malling.Under this scenario, the M26 would be closed to normal road users and lorries would park on the carriageway.Kent County Council believes this option could accommodate an additional 2,000 lorries.Roadworks have been taking place to install a temporary steel barrier on the M20 that would be used for Operation Brock.On 11 April, Highways England said it had scaled back its plan following the Brexit delay to 31 October.It said it would remove the contraflow on the M20 to "restore capacity on the motorway in time for the Easter bank holiday weekend."Kent County Council has also issued advice to local schools suggesting pupils and staff could be moved inside school buildings if extra lorry traffic causes air pollution to increase.Food The government has published a "tariff schedule" - a list of the taxes placed on different types of products when they are imported from other countries - which has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit.It will mean some goods from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper.And some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive.The British Retail Consortium has warned that there could be gaps on supermarket shelves if there is disruption at the border.Irish border The UK government published on 13 March its contingency plan to avoid a hard border (ie physical infrastructure) in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Under the plans, the UK will not bring in new checks or controls or require customs declarations for any goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of no deal.Image copyright Getty Images But this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer term solutions.The UK government says its contingency plan recognises "the unique social, political and economic circumstances of Northern Ireland".To protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked.The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself.But it has not specified exactly where they will take place.It remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland.Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market (such as at the Irish land border).However, the Irish government says there are "no plans for Border Inspection Posts on the border with Northern Ireland".Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Why UK child poverty targets won’t be met:::::Image copyright Getty Images Twenty years ago, then Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged to end child poverty in a generation, at a speech in central London.He called it a "20-year mission".Two decades and three prime ministers later, BBC Reality Check looks at what has happened to child poverty.What counts as poverty?If someone asked you what poverty was, you might think about how far someone's pay packet goes.Can they afford their household bills?Can they ever go on holiday?But rather than looking at how someone is making ends meet, the main way poverty is assessed is by using a relative measure - "relative poverty".It's calculated by taking the median income in the country - that's the midpoint where half of the overall population have income more than that amount and half have less.It was 507 a week in 2017-18, or 437 after housing costs.Then you take 60% of this middle amount and anyone who has less income than this is considered to be living in relative poverty.In 1998-99, 34% of children in the UK were living in relative-poverty households.Today, this proportion is 30%, which represents about 4.1 million children.How many children are in relative poverty?% of children in relative low income households after housing costs Statistics on income after housing costs and benefits received are more widely used as this gives a better idea of how much disposable income someone might have.But, some say relative poverty is flawed as a measure because the poverty line moves when average income changes.In times of recession, for example, when lots of people's wages decrease, relative poverty rates improve.That's because the gap between the median and lowest incomes is less but low-income families might not be any better off.Figures are also published on "absolute" poverty.Instead of comparing people's incomes with the average for the current year, these use a fixed year - 2010-11 - to track how many people have been in poverty over an extended period of time.This can help avoid the problems of a drop in incomes in one year changing the poverty line.But absolute poverty doesn't reflect how, if standards are rising quickly for the rest of society, the poorest are being left behind - because it is fixed on a middle income from almost a decade ago.On this measurement, the number of children in poverty has reduced more quickly, falling to 26% in 2017-18.How many children are in absolute poverty?% of children in absolute low income households after housing costs Analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC head of statistics With many different definitions of the poverty line, it's easier to understand what they mean by looking at pounds and pence.Here's what the version you'll hear most often from politicians, analysts and campaigners - relative poverty - means in real money.A one-child-one-parent family is poor unless they have more than 200 a week left to spend after paying their tax and housing costs.For a two-parent-two-child family, it's 360.That's not the dollar-a-day often referred to when talking about global poverty.In a rich country such as the UK, it's more about whether someone can do what all the people around them do and still make ends meet.In 2016, the Conservatives removed poverty targets established by Labour in 2010.The government said basing policies on "relative" poverty simply led to efforts to push income above the poverty line rather than tackling the underlying causes of poverty.Labour's targets were also based on incomes before housing costs were accounted for.Attempts have been made to agree an alternative measure of poverty - whether their income meets the material needs of a family, such as affording a bedroom for every child over 10 and a school trip once a term.Record high Meanwhile, the proportion of children living in relative poverty risks hitting a record high by the end of the Parliament, according to the Resolution Foundation.In a recent report, the research group said it was projected to rise to 37% by 2023-24.The foundation blames economic factors and government policy.It said a spike in inflation in 2017 and weak wage growth for lower-paid workers have put pressure on household budgets.Speaking to BBC News last year, Mr Blair said that efforts to reduce child poverty required a "new approach" to infrastructure, housing and investment in new technologies, saying these would help reduce wage stagnation.Image copyright Getty Images Child Poverty Action Group director of policy Louisa McGeehan said: "By 2021, we will be cutting 40bn a year from our work-and-pensions budget through cuts and freezes to tax credits and benefits and, as a result, we have put so much progress on child poverty into reverse."She also cites cuts to universal credit and the two-child cap on benefits as contributing to poverty rates.This week in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government is taking poverty "very seriously".She added: "The only sustainable way to tackle poverty is with a strong economy and a welfare system that helps people into work."Since becoming Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd has attempted to soften some benefit cuts introduced under the government's austerity programme, including removing the two-child cap on universal credit for some families.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: EU weighs risks of going into extra time:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Tense times for Europe: EU leaders Jean-Claude Juncker (L) and Donald Tusk (R), and Germany's Angela Merkel The UK impasse over Brexit casts a cloud of uncertainty over EU leaders meeting for emergency talks in Brussels on Wednesday.The 27 are frustrated with all the Brexit wrangling.They have agreed that 12 April will be the UK exit date, if by then Theresa May still has not got the withdrawal agreement passed by Parliament.So legally the UK could still exit on Friday.But neither the EU27 nor the UK Parliament wants it.An overwhelming majority of MPs voted against no deal.And there is a new complicating factor: European Parliament elections on 23-26 May.So what are Mrs May's EU partners saying?Donald Tusk's 'flextension' European Council President Donald Tusk is proposing a one-year flexible extension ("flextension").It would have a break clause, allowing the UK to exit earlier, if the UK Parliament finally ratifies the withdrawal agreement.The House of Commons has already rejected the agreement three times.The EU27 insists that the withdrawal deal cannot be renegotiated, but the accompanying political declaration - spelling out ambitions for future ties - can be revised.That declaration is not legally binding.There is still scope for the UK to agree, for example, to stay in a permanent customs union.In her Brexit "red lines" Mrs May insisted the UK would pull out of the EU customs union and single market.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.The opposition Labour Party - now in Brexit talks with Mrs May - is worried that any deal to have a softer Brexit, closer to the EU position, could still be scrapped by a future Conservative leader.So why might the EU27 opt for "flextension"?The EU wants to maintain a close partnership with the UK; a disorderly no-deal exit could ruin that The UK would have time to find a new Brexit compromise; it might even remain in the EU after a second referendum Any new EU decision to delay has to be unanimous; one country's veto could trigger no-deal Brexit.French scepticism The French government sees Theresa May's proposal, for the UK to exit on 30 June, as a political manoeuvre to appease MPs at Westminster.The EU27 have previously rejected a 30 June deadline.There is fierce Conservative opposition to the UK participating in the European elections.Exiting on 30 June would mean electing MEPs, but not actually sending them to Brussels, because the new parliament session starts on 2 July.French President Emmanuel Macron, an ardent champion of the EU, is sceptical about any further Brexit delays.One of his MPs, Bruno Bonnell, told the BBC that "we've been giving some delays so far, with no result".With all the turmoil at Westminster, he said, "we have to accept that no deal might be the option".A source close to President Macron also called Mr Tusk's one-year proposal "a clumsy trial balloon".France insists that Mrs May must present a "credible plan" for Brexit.Image copyright AFP Image caption President Macron objects to Theresa May's Brexit "red lines" What are the risks of a long delay for the EU27?Brexit threatens to eat up more of the EU's time, while other issues demand attention, such as the EU budget and new appointments to top jobs in the EU Legally it could be difficult to stop the departing UK still influencing EU policy in key areas The status of British MEPs would be strange - half-in, half-out of the European Parliament Irish border worries Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar favours a longer extension.He has warned that a no-deal Brexit would have dire consequences, almost certainly forcing the return of a hard border with Northern Ireland.On this week's summit, he said a country "wouldn't be forgiven" if it vetoed a postponement of Brexit, as that veto would cause hardship to Ireland and other EU countries.But he is against "rolling extensions" like Mrs May's new deadline, "because that just adds to the uncertainty".The backstop in the withdrawal agreement is Dublin's guarantee that the Northern Ireland border will remain open, free of physical infrastructure.Germany fears no-deal Brexit Chancellor Angela Merkel says Germany will do all it can to prevent a no-deal scenario."Where there's a will there's a way.We still hope for an orderly Brexit," she said in Ireland last week.Norbert Rttgen, head of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee, backed Mr Tusk's one-year delay.And Merkel ally Elmar Brok, a veteran of EU politics, said "we now want as long a delay as possible, ideally unlimited".Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte says UK politicians need to "make clear how they would want to use an extension".He has demanded "clarity" on that from Theresa May.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz says the EU has set "very clear deadlines and there is no reason to further extend those deadlines"."Unless the facts in Britain change.But we have not yet reached this point," he added.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki favours a long delay."Six, or nine, or twelve months, these options are acceptable to us," he said.
Was this the weirdest week in Westminster?:::::Image copyright UK Parliament Image caption Some found the week's activities funnier than others Here in Westminster, things haven't been "business as usual" for quite some time.But this week outdid itself, with every day delivering an odd surprise - and the funny reactions to match.These are just some of the weird and wonderful things to have taken place in SW1A over the past five days.Monday: Bumday We all know what it is like - that slow start to the week, the afternoon lull... Then boom!Twelve naked people crash into your office and demand action on climate change.No?Maybe it is just MPs then... On Monday, activists took over the public gallery in the Commons during a debate on indicative Brexit votes, with slogans painted across their bodies.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Semi-naked climate change protester on interrupting Brexit debate.MPs courageously carried on, with the odd reference ad-libbed into their speeches and a hair-raising facial expression or two, as some of the protesters managed to glue themselves to the security glass.It took the police a fair while to unstick the group and carry them off the premises, but the imprints of their backsides remained for some time - both on the glass and in our memories.Tuesday: Crack out the Chilean wine Every week, Theresa May summons her cabinet to No 10 for a chat (row) about the latest direction of the government.These occasions tend to last for about two hours before the top brass can head back to their departments and maybe get on with some non-Brexit related work - Steve Barclay is exempt from this, of course.But on Tuesday, after ministers arrived at Downing Street, the doors were locked and they were stuck in talks for more than seven hours.Think what you could do with seven hours: Watch nearly five football matches Smash through the whole series of Bodyguard Get a healthy amount of sleep But no, these ladies and gentlemen had to come up with an answer to the Brexit deadlock.To stop them telling gossip-hungry journalists what had been decided before she did, Mrs May is said to have shut them up in the cabinet room, confiscated their phones and fed them "cheap Chilean red wine".Wednesday: Message from the gods?As Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn entered into their talks on Wednesday afternoon, it seemed the weather gods were siding with the angry Brexiteers.A previously fine day was shaken by a huge clap of thunder and hailstones crashing on to the pavements, despite spring being well and truly sprung.But the dramatic scenes in the Commons were still to come.For the first time in 39 years, a vote by MPs was tied.It was on an amendment calling for backbenchers to take over business in the House for a fourth day, and the lead-up to the 310-310 result produced a lot of angry exchanges.So how was the impasse solved?Mr Order himself, Speaker John Bercow, got to have the casting vote and he went against the amendment.Cue lots of oohs and aahs from a Commons beside itself with procedure.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaker casts deciding vote after dead heat And the day was rounded off by an odd point of order from Tory backbencher Mark Francois after MPs approved a bill - in just one day - forcing the PM to ask the EU for an extension to Brexit.The staunch Leaver chose the run-up to Holy Week to exclaim: "Forgive them Father for they know not what they do."The Lord does work in mysterious ways... Thursday: Here comes the flood The biblical theme continued into Thursday.As MPs debated the introduction of a loan charge, water began to pour into the press gallery above, with journalists sprinting out to avoid damp shoes.While the hacks were tweeting puns about "leaks in Westminster", politicians tried to continue and be heard over the sound of running water.But despite it being a somewhat busy week in Parliament, Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle was forced to suspend the House, eventually adjourning - meaning they all got an early bath.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption House of Commons suspends sitting due to water leak Meanwhile, the Lords were embarking on an epic debate that saw so many votes, peers were up and down from the benches as if they had repeatedly sat on a hedgehog.It was a battle of Brexit, as one side tried to get Thursday's one-day bill through its peer review and the other tried to stop it.The players were "dusting off camp beds" and checking times for breakfast (07:30 BST if you were wondering), promising to debate through the night.But after almost 12 hours, they called it a day and went for a nightcap.Friday: You think it's all over...So far, so normal.But there are still a few hours to go.Maybe it will be locusts next...
Losing votes, losing ministers:::::Image copyright Getty Images It's fair to say that Theresa May has not had the smoothest ride as prime minister.Her job is to run the country, but really for her, it all comes down to Brexit.That was meant to be 29 March.But the UK is still in the EU and there's still no way out which everyone can agree on.Meanwhile, she has been repeatedly defeated in the House of Commons and has lost 20 ministers over her handling of Brexit.Things were very different a couple of years ago.Minority government is tough Theresa May was riding so high in 2017 that she decided to call a general election.The idea was to boost her position even further so she could get on with a nice smooth Brexit.Her gamble backfired.She ended up with 317 MPs - not enough for a majority in Parliament.She managed to scrape together the numbers she needed by teaming up with a party in Northern Ireland called the DUP.But they're not exactly BFFs.They have voted against her Brexit deal and called her negotiations "lamentable".To add insult to injury, four of her MPs have left the Conservative Party.Image caption The PM facing the flak in Parliament Biggest loser?This means it's even harder for her to win votes.She is losing often and losing big - and always on her core policy, Brexit.So far this year, she has had the 1st, 2nd and 5th largest defeats in recent times.Her government has lost in the House of Commons 23 times since December 2017.For context, Margaret Thatcher lost four votes in her 11 years as PM.Tony Blair had four defeats, Gordon Brown had three and David Cameron's coalition government saw six losses.They did have solid majorities though, so it was easier for them to win.You have to go back to the 70s to find other governments which have had more defeats.Prime Minister Harold Wilson lost 25 times in the Commons between 1974 and 1976.The biggest loser crown goes to Jim Callaghan though, with 34 defeats in 3 years from 1976.Ministerial merry-go-round It's normal to have some ministers coming and going over time.Then again it's normally the boss making those decisions - not the other way round.But the independent research group the Institute for Government says that's been "turbocharged since the 2017 election".Thirty-two government ministers have resigned or left their jobs.Some were part of reshuffles or because of other political problems.But 20 quit over Brexit.This shows how utterly divided the party is.And no prizes for guessing which bit of government has been the most unstable...The Department for Exiting the European Union.Only one junior minister from the original team is still working there.Image copyright Getty Images MPs running Parliament Normally the government controls what Parliament debates and which laws are passed.But that's been turned on its head.MPs, including some of her own backbenchers, have taken the power to bring their own laws.They have voted to force the PM to ask for an extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Some see this loss of control as the most serious part of this Brexistential crisis.Meanwhile, ordinary business is not getting done.Big announcements for things like housing and education seem to have gone missing.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Things have been bad before though - literally rubbish But actually....So far, so very, very damning.But you don't have to look far back in history to find dramatic moments of crisis that affected people in their everyday lives.In the 1970s Britain was known as the "sick man of Europe" as it ricocheted from one financial crisis to another.In 1974, fuel supplies got so low, businesses were put on a "three-day week".Two years later the value of the pound plummeted and the PM Jim Callaghan had to accept a humiliating 2.3bn bailout from the International Monetary Fund.1978 was known as the "winter of discontent" as everyone from bin men to gravediggers went on strike.By comparison, the economy looks very stable nowadays.Employment figures are the best since records began.The government has launched a long-term plan for the NHS in England.And over the last couple of years, Theresa May has generally got better polling figures than the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.So really how bad are things?It all depends how you measure it.And how you see the world.And how you view Brexit.For some the bigger picture is relatively rosy, but Theresa May's biggest focus has been Brexit.She has not managed to deliver it on time.She has lost control of her government and her Parliament.But, she is dealing with an unusually complicated situation where people on both sides have passionate views.Theresa May could well argue that it's too early to judge her yet.If she manages to get her Brexit deal through soon, she could claim that it's all been worthwhile.But that's a big if.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra -

Brexit delay: What does extension letter say?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The prime minister's original letter, setting out the UK's intention to leave the EU, was handed to Brussels on 29 March 2017 Theresa May has written to the European Union (EU) to request a further delay to Brexit until 30 June.Reality Check examines some of the key passages of the letter addressed to European Council President Donald Tusk.Extension date It is only towards the end of the letter that Mrs May spells out the proposed date for the further extension - 30 June.This is the same date as the prime minister's original request last month, and just so happens to be two days before the new European Parliament meets for the first time.But such a relatively short extension may not be on offer - the talk in other EU capitals has been of a longer extension until the end of this year at the earliest.Mr Tusk is likely to suggest a one-year extension.The EU may well be more receptive, though, to the idea of a get-out clause: it would mean that if a deal were to be approved by MPs and ratified earlier, the UK could leave the EU straightaway.That would suit both sides, and it's another idea that Donald Tusk has been promoting behind the scenes.The PM still hopes a deal can be finalised before voting in the European elections begin on 23 May, but given the divisions in Westminster the timetable for that already looks really tight.It's also worth bearing in mind, given the initial reaction to Mrs May's letter from Paris and other capitals, that granting any extension is not yet a done deal.Withdrawal agreement She is referring here to discussions between the government and Labour - and MPs more broadly - aimed at agreeing a Brexit plan which can be put to a currently deadlocked Parliament.This section is also a reminder for rebellious Conservative backbenchers and the DUP and its leader Arlene Foster: under this prime minister you can forget about reopening the withdrawal agreement and changing the wording of the Irish backstop.The EU has been ruling that out for months.Theresa May tried and failed to get them to change their minds (although her Tory critics say she didn't try hard enough), and now she's emphasised again that the focus for any new suggestions has to be the non-binding political declaration on what the future holds.The votes on various options in the House of Commons are designed to do that - but there's no cast-iron guarantee that a future government wouldn't opt for a change of course.Other options The prime minister is making a promise to the EU that if the House of Commons backs any kind of compromise proposal, the government "stands ready" to abide by that decision - if Labour does the same."Stands ready" isn't quite the same as "will" but it is pretty close.The dilemma for the PM, of course, is that backing a customs union would cross one of her red lines: that the UK must have a fully independent trade policy after Brexit.And membership of the single market, another option, would cross perhaps her reddest line of all - ending the free movement of people from the EU to the UK, and vice versa.Could that be a compromise too far for Theresa May?European elections The prime minister really doesn't want to hold European elections, but here in black and white is a commitment to the EU that preparations for the elections are taking place.That includes making the legal order that sets the date of the poll on 23 May - something that needs to be done by 11 April.The government will hope that this provides reassurance to other EU countries that it will hold the elections if it has to.Downing Street will also hope that election preparations concentrate minds among MPs who are refusing to back the prime minister's deal.'Sincere co-operation' The language here is really important.The prime minister is saying that the UK will not try to block EU business or be obstructive to other countries - something backbench critics, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, have already suggested could happen.The phrase "duty of sincere co-operation" carries some weight in Brussels, and is designed to reassure the EU that the UK will play by the rules as long as it remains a member state.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit talks: Will Labour push a public vote option?:::::Image copyright PA The view of Labour members seems clear.Polling for a project on party membership - led by Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University - was published at the turn of the year.It suggested more than 70% of Labour's members backed a second referendum.And if it were held, nearly nine out of 10 would vote to remain in the EU.But this wasn't a poll of shadow cabinet members.Nine of Jeremy Corbyn's top team are very, very sceptical of - or opposed to - another referendum.And most of these are his political allies.Public vote, private fears The man he installed as Labour Party chairman - Ian Lavery - is reported to have offered his resignation twice because he broke the party whip and failed to back a referendum in the recent indicative votes.Twice Mr Corbyn refused to accept it.From a Leave-supporting area in north east England, Mr Lavery is convinced Labour would pay a high political price if it is seen to be disrespecting the result of the 2016 referendum.It's interesting that the elections co-ordinator, Andrew Gwynne, who is not as close to Mr Corbyn, takes a similar view.So far, a formulation around the question of a second referendum has just about maintained a show of unity from senior figures in public - though this is now fraying.The form of words deployed is that Labour would support a "public vote" in order to avoid "a hard Tory Brexit" or "no deal".But these caveats now worry supporters of a referendum in the party - including some who sit at Mr Corbyn's top table.The fears are fuelled by the current cross-party talks.Because if Mr Corbyn was to reach a deal with Theresa May which avoids "a hard Tory Brexit", would the referendum commitment melt away?Shadow boxing Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry was so concerned she wrote to shadow cabinet colleagues last night to argue that ditching a public vote on any deal - including one hammered out with the prime minister - would breach party policy and would require a vote of the whole shadow cabinet.At last night's special meeting of shadow ministers, I am told Ms Thornberry's possible leadership ambitions were aired.(She couldn't be there for family reasons).Key figures in Mr Corbyn's office were furious at her intervention.But the party's deputy leader Tom Watson - who doesn't always see eye to eye with the shadow foreign secretary - took to the airwaves to insist: "Our position is we want a confirmatory ballot."It's very difficult for us to move off that because I don't think our party would forgive us if we signed off on Tory Brexit without that kind of concession."Even more uncomfortably for the Labour leader, left-wing allies have written to him to push for a referendum commitment in talks with the prime minister.The eleven signatories include shadow ministers Clive Lewis and Rachael Maskell.They wrote: "We - your supporters - urge you to make a confirmatory public vote your bottom line in negotiations with Theresa May and to fight to bring this government down."Mr Corbyn has said he did raise the "option" of a public vote with Mrs May yesterday and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said today that a "confirmatory vote" would be discussed at what are being billed as technical discussions between Labour and Conservative frontbenchers.Meaningful policy?Behind the scenes there is what to outsiders will look like a "dance on the head of a pin" argument going on as to what Labour's policy actually is on a public vote - but the interpretation could determine how hard, or otherwise, the referendum is pushed in talks.The motion agreed last autumn at Labour's conference says "should Parliament vote down a Tory Brexit deal, or the talks end in no deal" then there should be a general election.If that doesn't happen, then "Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote".Supporters of a referendum say that Mrs May's "Tory Brexit deal" - as represented by two meaningful votes - has been voted down.So Labour should now be calling unequivocally for a "public vote" on any deal.Sceptics and opponents stress, on the other hand, that it should still be a last resort to prevent no deal, or another attempt to get Mrs May's unrevised deal over the line.Divided we stand So a group of 25 Labour MPs from Leave areas has written to Mr Corbyn urging him to "compromise" in talks with Mrs May.The group includes the shadow minister Gloria De Piero, and former shadow minister Melanie Onn, who resigned because she voted against the referendum option rather than abstain on an indicative vote.More familiar supporters of Mrs May's current deal - such as Caroline Flint and Sir Kevin Barron - have added their names too - as has Lisa Nandy, the former frontbencher who has so far held out against the prime minister's deal, but who could be persuaded if it were combined with a customs union.The signatories say: "Our policy seeks a deal that protects jobs and rights at work.It does not require a confirmatory ballot on any deal that meets those conditions."The political hook But sources close to the Labour leader think the fuss over a referendum is over-blown, as government and opposition are unlikely to agree a joint motion on Brexit in any case.It's far more likely there will be a series of votes on a range of options - including a referendum - next week.Peter Kyle, who drafted a motion on the option of a referendum during the phase of indicative votes, is hopeful of success.His formulation garnered more votes - though not a majority - from MPs than any other option.But some close to the Labour leadership believe it will, once again, be rejected.That outcome would get both the prime minister and the opposition leader off a potentially painful political hook.But it doesn't bring a Brexit deal any closer.
Led by Donkeys and Brexit Express: Why campaigners are using the humble billboard:::::Image copyright Brexit Express Image caption Campaign groups, including those for Brexit, are among those hiring out billboards In a world which is increasingly moving online, the old-fashioned billboard seems to be having a moment.Brexit campaigners on both sides have hired billboards across the UK, while activists for other causes - from promoting the Saudi crown prince to veganism - have got in on the act.This is despite internet advertising booming: in 2017, the 11.5bn online market overtook all other forms, a report for the government found.So why are billboards still popular?The Brexit campaigners Led By Donkeys is the name of a group of four friends who describe themselves as an anti-Brexit guerrilla protest group.They came up with their idea last December, while discussing Brexit in a pub.They were talking about how tweets (in particular one of David Cameron's) can get lost amid the noise of the internet.They wondered: "Can we make sure it wasn't forgotten about?"Four months on, the group has hired more than 240 billboards across the UK, having raised over 340,000.The posters feature old tweets or quotes from politicians who have been involved in the Brexit process.Image copyright Led By Donkeys Image caption The first billboard went up next to the A10 in London Why choose billboards?Co-founder Adam - not his real name - believes endless scrolling through digital content has led to a "problem in holding politicians to account - they get away with saying things"."Very quickly these quotes disappear into the digital graveyard.We have put these tweets back into the public space.It gives people the opportunity to re-read them in the reality about what's unfolding.""In an information-rich, perhaps information-overloaded age, putting these words up without... commentary gives people an opportunity to appraise them on their own terms."That's the space in which people can begin to change their own minds."Image copyright Led By Donkeys Image caption A banner in Dover shows a quote during a 2011 debate on the UK's relationship with the EU There's another point, he added - not everyone who is politically engaged is on social media."Taking [the words] off the digital, makes them more tangible.That move from digital into physical thing, the responsibility for the words becomes more acute."On the other side of the debate is Brexit Express, a pro-Leave group formed in the run up to the 2016 EU referendum.Image copyright Brexit Exoress Image caption Brexit Express says the group is not party political Its current campaign started a month ago, though not in response to Led By Donkeys, said Patrick Barrow.It has more than 100 ads up across the UK at the moment."Its simple reasoning is to really ensure MPs are reminded of public opinion," he said.The idea the internet is king is true "up to a point [but] at some point most people are on the roads, on the street, in a Tube station."Image copyright Brexit Express Image caption The response on Twitter has been "positive", the group said, although there have been some attempts to take the posters down In that regard, physical posters can complement online campaigns, he said.Billboard ads are "more impactful" and "play much more to the tried and tested techniques of commercial and political slogans".He cites iconic slogans such as "Beanz meanz Heinz", adding: "These are things that people store in their heads."The 2017 film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, about a grieving mother who seeks justice for her murdered daughter by hiring billboards, sparked similar campaigns.Last year in London, Grenfell Tower campaigners drove banners in the same colours and font of those in the film through the capital.Image copyright Jeff Moore/Justice4Grenfell Image caption The billboard campaign demanded justice for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Other stunts - including one by NHS campaigners in Bristol - have also taken inspiration from the film.And separately, in March last year, huge signs promoted the Saudi crown prince ahead of his visit to London.Yvette Williams, from the Justice 4 Grenfell group which was behind their billboard effort, said organisers were looking for new ideas to draw attention - and, in particular, catch the eye of young people.The three signs achieved their aim."Stormzy picked it up," she said, referring to the south London grime star who, during his Brits performance a week later, criticised Theresa May over the government's response to Grenfell.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption "Billboards still work," said Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri actress Frances McDormand, who said she enjoyed seeing them move "off the screen and onto the street" Last summer, vegan Tony Galuidi, from Middlesbrough, spent 2,400 on four billboards near the town's traffic hotspots, to urge people to consider what they eat.For Mr Galuidi, the publicity was much of the attraction.Image copyright Tony Galuidi Image caption Mr Galuidi said "the novelty" of buying a billboard is a "different way to get the message across" "I was wanting the press to see all of it.As a consequence, I have been on TV twice, written in the i newspaper and on the radio.It's been brilliant for promoting the message."The money was "absolutely" worth it, he said.The billboard businesses According to Outsmart, the trade body for the billboard industry, the market for "out of home advertising" grew by 5.7% last year to be worth 1,209m.However, data suggests this growth is down to the boom in digital billboards.Traditional ad hoardings have seen a decline in revenue.The market for billboards is showing "continued steady growth" said Martin Corke, of Clear Channel UK - part of one of the world's largest outdoor advertising firms.Globally, it sells space on hundreds of thousands of billboards.With 12,000 in the UK, national reach - "they are kind of everywhere" - is a big draw.But also, they are a "safe place"."Brands don't have to worry about appearing next to inappropriate content.You are in the public domain, it's a very open environment."By contrast, online ads risk appearing next to offensive content.An obvious perk for advertisers is that "the public can't miss them".Another is they represent good value, with rent for a two-week billboard starting from hundreds of pounds.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption "We know through research that brands that are in the public domain are more trusted," Mr Corke said Meanwhile, Simon Boon, director of billboard advertising company Airoutdoor - one of several which sold space to the group Led By Donkeys - said traditional billboard advertising "works beautifully" with online."Although we spend a lot of time on a device, we are still driving our cars, walking to work."Mr Boon said the company is apolitical, but believes in freedom of speech."We said we will do this as long as there's no politics and swearing," he said."No obscenities, nothing which can be any way illegal or immoral.As long as it meets that criteria, we are happy to put it up."The Advertising Standards Authority said billboard ads must not be misleading, harmful or offensive.However, it said it does not regulate political ads, so when campaign groups buy billboard space it is likely to be considered political and falls out of its remit.
Brexit talks: What are the likely sticking points?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Cross-party talks between the Conservatives and Labour, aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock, are continuing.Theresa May has said she wants to negotiate a "joint plan" with Jeremy Corbyn.If that is agreed, it would then be put to MPs in the hope that a Brexit deal could finally be voted through Parliament.Both leaders have agreed a "programme of work" for their negotiating teams to work on.So, what are the main differences likely to be when it comes to Brexit and where might possible compromise be found?Customs union Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU - it's one of her so-called red lines.As a member of the European Union, the UK is part of the EU customs union.Its members have an agreement not to carry out checks or put tariffs (extra payments) on goods that move around the area.This can be particularly advantageous for businesses whose goods cross multiple EU borders.But critics of the system say it has several drawbacks.For one, members of the customs union cannot negotiate their own trade deals, on goods, with other countries - such as the United States.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.As recently as 25 March, the prime minister rejected the idea of a customs union, saying it "does not deliver on [an] independent trade policy".Labour says it wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, after Brexit.But it also says it wants the UK to "have a say" when the EU strikes future trade deals.The level of UK involvement would depend on what Labour means by "have a say" but EU law currently prevents a non-EU member from influencing or vetoing its trade negotiations.But Labour says its policy cannot be ruled out until it has had a chance to negotiate this with the EU.Single market Membership of the single market is another area where there are differences.The EU single market requires members to follow the same regulations and standards to keep trade flowing freely.It is based on four freedoms: goods, services, money and people (this last one allows EU citizens to live and work in the UK, and vice versa).When Theresa May first set out her Brexit negotiating objectives, she said failing to leave the single market "would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all".That's because the UK would have to continue to pay into the EU budget, follow all the rules, and continue to allow freedom of movement.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.Labour's policy, on the other hand, is to have "close alignment with the single market".But the EU has previously said the UK cannot cherry-pick only the parts of the single market it likes.So, it's unclear what the EU would accept as "close alignment", which Labour is calling for.Immigration Theresa May has always been firm that Brexit must mean the end to freedom of movement.In her 2017 election manifesto, she set out plans for an immigration system designed to "reduce and control" the number of people coming to the UK from the EU - and she hasn't wavered from this pledge.Like the Conservatives, Labour also pledged at the 2017 election to end freedom of movement.So, on the surface, this looks like something on which the two party leaders could agree.But in January, when it came to voting on the Immigration Bill, which would put an end to freedom of movement, Labour encouraged its MPs to vote against it.A big unknown is whether Labour's policy of "close alignment" with the single market might restrict the UK's ability to set its own immigration policy.Its Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, previously told BBC News the party would be willing to accept some EU workers but with restrictions."If somebody is coming to do a job and it needs to be done and it has been advertised locally beforehand with nobody able to do it, then most people would say, 'I accept that,'" he said.A Labour spokesperson said: "We support fair rules and the reasonable management of migration."Workers' rights Theresa May has said she's made it clear in the political declaration - the part of her deal agreed with the EU concerning the future relationship - that the UK agrees to not going backwards in terms of workers' rights.But she has not guaranteed that when the EU introduces a new right or protection for workers, the UK will also adopt it.In Prime Minister's Questions last week, though, Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to use EU standards, including any introduced in the future, as a minimum for the UK to improve on.He accused the prime minister's deal of involving a "race to the bottom" on workers' rights - something he said Labour's proposals would prevent.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: Can you have frictionless trade in a customs union?:::::Sir Oliver Letwin told BBC News on Wednesday morning: "I think it should be possible to forge an arrangement in which we do have frictionless trade in a customs union, for the time being at least."At the moment, the UK has frictionless trade with other European Union (EU) countries because the EU is both a single market and a customs union.The customs union means that once goods have cleared customs in one country and the commonly agreed tariffs (charges on imports) have been paid, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed.The single-market part means that there is free movement of goods, services, capital and people and all the members follow the same rules, regulations and standards.Having just one or the other does not give you frictionless trade.Image copyright AFP Turkey, for example, has a customs union with the EU, covering most manufactured goods, but is not part of the single market.The border between Turkey and Bulgaria is far from frictionless.Documentation is needed to cross the border, including things such as export licences, invoices and transport permits.A report prepared for the European Commission in 2014 suggested a waiting time of about three hours for lorries travelling from Turkey to Bulgaria - but, anecdotally, lorry drivers say they sometimes have to wait for more than 24 hours, in queues several kilometres long.Norway is part of the single market but not part of the EU or its customs union.Image copyright Getty Images That means that goods exported from Norway into the EU must meet rules of origin requirements, to demonstrate that they do not contain more than the maximum permitted level of parts and components from elsewhere.Norway's border with Sweden, for example, is one of the most frictionless in the world between two countries that do not have a customs union - but it still takes about 20 minutes on average for a lorry to pass through its main border crossing, at Svinesund.Sir Oliver told BBC Reality Check: "I am of course assuming that the Chequers arrangement for a single market in goods is also part of the deal, as both Mr Corbyn and Mrs May will wish it to be."While Theresa May's Chequers agreement did indeed suggest a common rulebook on goods, the political declaration that sets out the starting point for the negotiations on a future relationship says that trade in goods should be "as close as possible", which is not the same as being frictionless.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Has Theresa May's Brexit strategy left the DUP in the lurch?:::::Image copyright Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA Image caption The DUP and Conservatives entered a confidence-and-supply arrangement after the 2017 General Election Has the shift in Theresa May's Brexit strategy left the DUP in the lurch?It certainly looks that way.Up to now, the prime minister had been trying to win the votes of the 10 DUP MPs, by seeking changes to her deal.It seems she has now decided that path has reached a dead end.Mrs May has side-stepped her confidence-and-supply partners, and turned to the official opposition benches to reach consensus.Yet again, the DUP has criticised her overall handling of the negotiations, this time as "lamentable".It's warned that allowing Jeremy Corbyn to "sub-contract" the future of Brexit is unlikely to end well.But Number 10 has likely listened to the repeated opposition coming from DUP quarters and figured that it's time to pursue a more flexible route.As recently as Sunday, Sammy Wilson said the DUP would vote against the deal "1,000 times", if it stayed the same.Well, there's no re-negotiation on the backstop forthcoming from the EU.Theresa May has accepted that avenue isn't open to her - despite the DUP's repeated calls for it.It's not clear if talks with Labour will lead to much, or if the EU will be willing to grant another extension, without enforcing certain conditions like the UK taking part in next month's European elections.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: "I recognise that she has made a move...I recognise my responsibility" If something can emerge from the May-Corbyn talks, the government has said that won't change the withdrawal agreement - but rather shape the UK's future relationship with the EU (the political declaration).That means getting Labour to accept the backstop, which will prove a big task unless the prime minister is willing to show flexibility on some of Labour's demands.Other parties in Northern Ireland, who are pro-remain and support the backstop, will hope Theresa May has now left behind the Brexiteer wing of her party and the DUP.The repeated criticism being that the DUP does not represent the majority in Northern Ireland who voted remain in 2016's referendum.The DUP, meanwhile, has not indicated that it is preparing to withdraw its support for the government.It's always said it would only take drastic action, if the government got the withdrawal agreement (including the backstop) through Parliament.That's still a big if: Mrs May's change of direction, however, shows she is determined - one way or another - to get the votes she needs from somewhere, to avoid no deal.Pulling the plug The DUP could yet pull the plug - but given the influence it wields at Westminster, that's not a decision it will take easily.On Tuesday night, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the government still wanted to secure the support of the DUP - but it's hard to see how this could happen, when it is now pursuing options the DUP is so against.Image copyright PAcemaker Image caption Boris Johnson was a guest speaker at the DUP party conference in 2018 Labour's call for a permanent customs union with the EU would breach the version of Brexit that the DUP wants, and also would not eliminate the potential for border checks in Ireland.For its part, the DUP says it will judge all outcomes in the coming days against its "clear unionist principles".However much resistance it puts up, for now Mrs May is taking her chances with Labour - and leaving her Northern Ireland allies in the margins.
Brexit deadlock: The Commons in numbers:::::The House of Commons continues to struggle to break the Brexit deadlock.MPs have rejected the UK's withdrawal agreement with the EU three times and have twice voted down all the alternative options put forward.An explanation for this stalemate can be found not only in MPs' deeply-held and divergent views on Europe but also in the fluid political make-up of the House of Commons.What was the situation in 2017?Image copyright PA Image caption The DUP have supported the Conservatives since 2017 but will their agreement survive Brexit?No political party won a majority at the 2017 election, which resulted in a Hung Parliament.After the poll, the Conservatives agreed a parliamentary pact - officially known as a confidence and supply agreement - with the Democratic Unionists.This arrangement gave Theresa May's government an overall majority of six - in other words, the Tories and DUP had six more MPs elected than all the other parties combined.But in reality it had what is called a working majority of 13.That's because Sinn Fein - which currently has seven MPs - historically does not take up its seats.Excluding Commons Speaker John Bercow and his non-voting deputies, Tory Eleanor Laing and Labour's Lindsay Hoyle and Dame Rosie Winterton, Theresa May has typically needed to get the backing of 320 MPs to get a majority in Commons votes.For the first year or so, the government got its legislation through Parliament quite comfortably but as Mrs May has found to her cost, things have become much more problematic in recent months.What's changed?Image copyright AFP Image caption Anna Soubry (centre) and Sarah Wollaston (right) are among those to have left the Conservatives The government's already slim working majority - the smallest of any new government since the 1970s - has been further whittled down this year.In January, three Conservative members of Parliament - Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry - quit the party to join the Independent Group of MPs.Then on Monday, former minister Nick Boles resigned the Conservative whip over Brexit and said he would be sitting as an Independent Progressive Conservative.What's the current state of play?Image copyright AFP Image caption Labour has suffered its own casualties - losing more than a dozen MPs As it stands, Theresa May currently has a working majority of six.This will fall to five if Labour wins the Newport West by-election on Thursday.The seat has been vacant since the death of Paul Flynn in February.Labour has held the seat since 1987 and Mr Flynn re-gained it with a majority of 5,658 two years ago.The Conservatives are still the largest party by far in the House of Commons, with 312 MPs.Their direct numerical lead over Labour, the second largest party, has actually grown since 2017.After the last election, it stood at 55 seats.Now it is 68.That's because Labour, which currently has 243 MPs, has suffered a slew of defections of their own.Eight of their MPs left to join the Independent Group while another five - Ivan Lewis, John Woodcock, Jared O'Mara, Frank Field and Ian Austin - have quit the party for a variety of reasons and are now sitting as independents.Fiona Onasanya was expelled after being jailed for perverting the course of justice while Kelvin Hopkins and Chris Williamson are currently suspended pending internal inquiries into their conduct.What does this mean for Brexit?With the DUP opposed to her agreement and Tory MPs increasingly prepared to defy the whip, Theresa May has no real majority to speak of for her Brexit policy.As well as the three defeats on the withdrawal agreement, the government has been left red-faced on numerous other occasions, even losing control of the House during the indicative votes process.When it has won key votes, it has often only done so by the skin of its teeth.The government is opposed by a broad coalition of Labour, SNP, Lib Dem, Plaid Cymru and Green MPs who are pushing for a different kind of exit, or who want to remain in the EU.While some of the newly-independent MPs, including ex-Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd, have sided with Mrs May over Brexit, most have not while the Independent Group has voted as a bloc against the PM.What does this mean for a confidence vote?Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no-confidence motion in the government in January, shortly after its first defeat on Theresa May's Brexit deal.Every single Conservative MP at the time supported the government, as did the Democratic Unionists, as the government survived by a margin of 325 to 306 votes.But the result could be a lot closer if the Labour leader chooses to repeat the exercise again.Not only do the Conservatives have fewer MPs but leading Tory Brexiteers have warned the PM their support cannot be taken for granted if they think the future of Brexit is under threat.And the DUP have said they will use all means to oppose the withdrawal agreement in its current form.
Brexit delay: How can Article 50 be extended?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May has said she will ask the European Union for a further delay to Brexit to break the political deadlock at Westminster.As things stand, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April.The prime minister said a further extension to Article 50 was needed in order to leave the EU "in a timely and orderly way".She has offered to sit down with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a plan.She said it would have to include the current withdrawal agreement (negotiated between the UK and EU) and would focus on the future relationship with the EU.The aim would be to put it to MPs for approval and then take it to Brussels next week.If Mrs May and Mr Corbyn couldn't agree on a single plan then a range of options could be put to MPs instead.Article 50 This further delay requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty which sets out what happens when a country decides that it wants to leave the EU.It allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on a divorce - finalising a withdrawal agreement and drawing up the broad outlines of a future relationship.Theresa May and her fellow EU leaders agreed both of those but their deal has been rejected - in successive votes - in the House of Commons.The UK was due to leave on 29 March (two years after Article 50 was triggered) but, because no agreement could be reached at Westminster, the prime minister asked the EU for a delay to avoid the UK leaving without a deal.Now, she says she needs more time - so how does she go about getting it?The UK makes a request The UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it needs the agreement of all 27 other EU countries (EU27).That's what happened when the original 29 March deadline was extended.On that occasion, the request was made in a letter from Theresa May to the European Council, on 20 March.The EU agreed to delay the UK's departure although not the UK's suggested date, of 30 June.Instead, it offered two alternative dates: until 22 May, if MPs voted through the government's withdrawal agreement (by 29 March).They didn't.until 12 April, if they rejected it.Now, Theresa May has said she wants a further extension that is "as short as possible".She said the government would want a deal to be passed before 22 May to avoid the prospect of the UK having to take part in European elections.The UK will need to submit its request to EU27 leaders ahead of an emergency summit on 10 April.The EU's decision But the EU is not obliged to say yes to the UK.One big issue is the European elections which are due to start on 23 May.The EU has said the UK cannot stay beyond 22 May if it doesn't take part in the polls.The European Parliament's legal service had argued that an extension to the end of June would be fine because the new parliament would not have held its first session by then.But EU leaders have sided with a stricter legal interpretation put forward by the European Commission, which argued that allowing the UK to stay in the EU without taking part in European elections was far too much of a risk.A longer extension?The EU could insist on a longer extension.But Theresa May has been firm in saying that she doesn't want one because she "shares the frustration" that many people feel about the Brexit process.If the EU decided to offer the UK a delay of between nine and 12 months, or even longer, there could be a get-out clause: an understanding that the UK could leave the EU earlier than the specified date if the government managed to get an exit deal passed in Parliament.A long extension could also buy time for either an early UK general election or even another Brexit referendum.For now, the government says it doesn't want either of those.Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator has said a long extension carried "significant risks for the EU" and that a "strong justification would be needed" before the EU would agree.Revoking Article 50 It's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be withdrawn or revoked.The UK can do that without consulting anyone else.It would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now.But, again, Theresa May has said she does not intend to do that.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be "unequivocal and unconditional", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter

What does a no-deal Brexit actually mean?:::::Image copyright REX/Shutterstock Image caption Not now, mate What does the phrase "no deal" mean to you?Depending on whether your answer is "an anonymous phone call offering me money" or "one of the options MPs are being asked to consider to determine how the UK leaves the EU" will probably show how devoted you are to Brexit.Similar to any big game show (we're talking politics now, sorry Deal or No Deal fans), Brexit has had its fair share of twists and turns and dramatic moments since the referendum vote in June 2016.Whether it's the "Nick, don't go!"EastEnders-style moment... Or Theresa May's car door being an analogy for the whole process... Or Brexit making a celebrity out of the grown man that has to shout "order" at MPs in a very dramatic way...It's been FULL.OF.BANTS.Well stitch up your sides and buckle up because there's another Brexit staple that's popping up more and more now (which you might want to add to your Brexit vocabulary): No-deal Brexit.What does it mean?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption No deal is becoming "more likely" according to the EU's chief negotiator No deal means the UK leaving the European Union and cutting ties immediately, with no agreement at all in place.The EU has previously said a no-deal Brexit would mean border checks would have to be brought in - which would affect things like exports and travel between the UK and EU.Things like how the UK trades with the EU and the rights of UK citizens living in the EU and visa-versa would also be up in the air.The government says it's made initial plans for a no-deal Brexit and has told businesses to do the same.Image copyright UK PARLIAMENTARY RECORDING UNIT Image caption Heads up, this is what Theresa May means if she ever invites you to a lock-in The UK was due to leave the UK on 29 March but so-called Brexit day sailed by after politicians repeatedly voted against the proposal Theresa May hammered out with the EU (aka the withdrawal deal).The EU has given the UK until 12 April to see if Parliament can agree on what should happen next - with the general understanding that yet another extension would only be on the table if the UK knows what it wants to do.At the moment, that's not happening.MPs have been voting on various other options but none have been agreed.On Tuesday 2 April, Theresa May emerged from a mammoth Brexit-escape-room-type-nightmare round of talks to say she wants a short extension to the deadline - no later than 22 May.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thankfully, for everyone involved, this guy has nothing to do with this type of deadlock But, if things carry on until 12 April without MPs agreeing another option - as it stands - the UK would leave the EU with no deal.And if (yes, another if) that happens the UK would have to follow rules set out by the World Trade Organization (WTO).It would mean UK exports would be put under the same checks and tariffs that the EU puts on other non-EU countries which also follow these rules.Some Brexiteers support a no-deal Brexit and say it would mean the UK would be fully independent, would be able make trade deals around the world and wouldn't have to pay the divorce bill - estimated to be 39bn.But no-deal critics say it could cause chaos at the borders, push up food prices and damage businesses and the economy.With Brexit Day 2.0 still days away, there's still time for Theresa May to ask MPs to vote on her deal for a fourth time, an emergency summit of EU leaders to consider another Brexit extension to be held, and a load more no-deal memes to spread around WhatsApp.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.
Soft Brexit: What are the options?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Brexit isn't a moment or a single day.It's a long-term process.And that begs the question: where is the UK likely to end up?When people talk about a "soft Brexit" they are usually referring to the kind of economic relationship the UK will have with the EU in the future.And most of the debate revolves around two things: membership of a customs union and membership of the EU single market.Customs union Being in a customs union means there are no tariffs (or import taxes) on goods traded between two countries or trade blocs, and no other customs infrastructure.Once goods arriving from other countries have crossed the external border of a customs union, they can then move around freely without any further customs checks or payments.For companies that operate in European markets that is a huge benefit.It helps protect their complex supply chains, which often see parts cross borders several times during the manufacturing process.But the removal of internal tariffs also means members of a customs union have to apply the same external tariff to goods arriving from the rest of the world.And, after Brexit, that would limit the UK's ability to pursue a fully independent trade policy, breaking one of Theresa May's red lines.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.The UK wouldn't be able to sign separate trade agreements on goods, but it would still be able to do deals in the service sector (there are no tariffs on services).The other thing worth remembering about a customs union proposal is that - on its own - it wouldn't meet the test of avoiding a hard border in Ireland "under all circumstances".It would help, but there are other checks that need to take place at borders that have nothing to do with customs.So a customs union alone also wouldn't guarantee that trade between Dover and Calais, an economic lifeline for the UK, would be as open as it is now.Single market This is the other main building block for the UK's current economic life inside the EU.Being in the EU single market means all the rules that govern the economy are the same.That can be anything from regulations on chemicals or pharmaceuticals, to the rules on food safety and animal welfare.Staying in the single market would mean all those rules stay the same - and the UK would have to continue to respect the EU's four freedoms.That's the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.So it would be good news for the service sector, which makes up about three-quarters of the UK economy.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.But the reddest of the prime minister's red lines is probably her determination to end the free movement of people from the EU.Staying in the single market (but outside the EU) would mean that isn't possible.There are circumstances in which you can limit free movement if there is a sudden surge of arrivals, but it's fairly limited and not automatic.Common Market 2.0 Some MPs want to combine single market membership with some sort of customs arrangement that would be a customs union in all but name.This is the proposal known as Common Market 2.0 and is probably the softest form of Brexit being debated.It would resolve problems at the Irish border.One of the big differences from the UK's current status is that it would no longer have to be part of the EU's common fishing and agriculture policies.But critics argue that if you're staying in the single market and in a close customs partnership, there's not much point in leaving the EU in the first place.None of the above There are of course plenty of Conservative MPs who would prefer to leave with no deal than any of the options outlined above.Initially, trading would be done on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms - which would mean some goods would be subject to tariffs.The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these "as far as possible".In addition to tariffs, there would be extra checks at the external border of the single market - which could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover).But even if you leave with no deal, you still need to negotiate a future relationship.No-one is advocating cutting trade links with the EU altogether.Most no-deal Conservatives want to end up in a free trade agreement with the EU, similar to the one negotiated in the last few years between the EU and Canada.They argue that because the UK will be a much more important trading partner for the EU, it can get a much better deal than Canada.That would get rid of most tariffs on goods, but it wouldn't deal with other aspects of customs such as rules of origin, which mean companies have to prove where all the parts in their products have come from.That can be a time-consuming and expensive business.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some Brexiters favour a future relationship based on the EU-Canada free trade deal A free trade agreement is a much looser economic partnership than membership of the single market and the customs union, or of any combination of the two.It would allow the UK to regain more sovereignty over the economic decisions it has to make, but it would make trading with the EU, its largest single partner, more difficult.Nearly three years after the Brexit referendum, these are the choices that MPs are still struggling with.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions
Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU:::::Image copyright AFP Feeling a little lost on Brexit?Never really got your head around it in the first place?Let us walk you through it.What is Brexit?Brexit is short for "British exit" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU).What is the EU?The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work (click here if you want to see the full list).The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973.Why is the UK leaving?A public vote - called a referendum - was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.The Leave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m - but the exit didn't happen straight away.It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been extended twice (we will explain in more detail below).What has happened so far?The 2016 vote was just the start.Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries.The discussions have been mainly over the "divorce" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards.This deal is known as the Withdrawal Agreement.Image copyright AFP What does the Withdrawal Agreement say?The Withdrawal Agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about 39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU, and equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) A length of time, called the transition period, has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust.That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020.Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term.This is the political declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks.The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs.Have MPs backed the Withdrawal Agreement?Well, no.They have voted against it three times.On 15 January they rejected the deal by 432 votes to 202 - a record defeat.Then on 12 March, after Theresa May had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances, they rejected it again.And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU - MPs rejected it for a third time (this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration).The UK was meant to leave on 29 March - why didn't it?As MPs did not approve Theresa May's withdrawal deal in a vote on 12 March, the prime minister was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit.They agreed to postpone it until 22 May, if MPs approved her deal in a new vote.As they didn't (on 29 March), the UK missed that deadline and faced leaving on 12 April instead.But Mrs May has now gone back to the EU to ask for another extension - which the EU has agreed to.The new deadline is 31 October.However, the UK can leave before then if the prime minister can somehow get her deal approved by Parliament.So what happens now?The government will continue talks with Labour to try to come up with a solution.If the two sides do not come to an agreement, Theresa May has said she will put a number of options to MPs to work out what to do next.Why do people oppose the deal?Image copyright Getty Images There are a broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU.One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border.Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something called the backstop - a sort of safety net - was included in the deal.What is the backstop?The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations.It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.The prime minister insists that if all goes as planned it will never be used.But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good.Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still, in it.And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK.On 11 March, Mrs May and the EU released a statement, giving added legal reassurances that the backstop plan, if it ever needed to be used, would only be temporary.Mrs May hoped the statement would persuade her MPs to vote for her deal, but it was still rejected.So could Brexit actually not happen at all?It is written into law that the UK will be leaving.The European Court of Justice has said the UK could cancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations, but politically, that's not likely to happen.What happens if the UK leaves without a deal?"No deal" means the UK would have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement.That would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves, and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately (more on that here).The government says it is preparing for this potential situation.It expects some food prices could rise and checks at customs could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here).It has published a series of guides - which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies.Here is a list of 10 ways you could be affected by a no-deal Brexit.
Brexit: What is Common Market 2.0?:::::Image copyright Getty Images A group of Labour and Conservative MPs is promoting what they call Common Market 2.0 as an alternative model for the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit.You may have also heard it referred to as Norway Plus.The MPs promoting it say it would go back to the sort of economic relationship the UK had with the European Economic Community in the 1970s and 80s, without having to be involved with closer political union or the direct involvement of the European Court of Justice.They also say it could be agreed with the EU quickly and that there could be a majority for it in the House of Commons.Critics point out that it would still involve freedom of movement, making significant contributions to the EU Budget and following EU regulations without membership of the bodies that create them.It crosses several of Theresa May's red lines.How would it work?The European Economic Area (EEA) includes all 28 EU countries and three nations that are not members of the EU: Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are part of the Single Market but not the EU or its Customs Union.They are members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), along with Switzerland, which is not part of the EEA, having single market membership as a result of a complicated set of trade deals with the EU.They make substantial contributions to the EU budget, and have to follow many EU rules and laws.EFTA members are not part of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) or the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), so they can set their own policies in those areas.They are also exempt from EU rules on justice and home affairs.What about the Customs Union?EFTA members are not members of the EU Customs Union, which means they can sign their own trade deals with other countries, but they do not benefit from EU trade deals with other countries.There have to be some customs checks on goods travelling between EFTA countries and EU countries.Norway's border with Sweden, for example, is one of the most frictionless in the world between two countries that do not have a customs union, but it still takes about 20 minutes on average for a lorry to pass through its main border crossing at Svinesund.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Svinesund Bridge is a border crossing between Sweden and Norway This is a problem for the Common Market 2.0 plan because in order to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, its supporters are proposing that there should be a customs arrangement that basically mirrors the Customs Union.It is the extra customs arrangement that makes the proposed solution a "Norway plus" deal.But having that sort of customs arrangement would be against EFTA's current rules.How much would it cost?As an EFTA member, the UK would continue to make contributions to the EU Budget.They would be calculated based on which EU programmes the UK wished to continue to be involved with.It is likely that the bill would be considerably lower than it is as an EU member.It's not clear exactly how much lower it would be, with estimates ranging between two thirds and 88% of the current level, which is about 9bn a year on average.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.What about having no say in the rules?When the EU adopts a measure that is relevant to the single market, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have to bring it into their domestic laws.The three countries do not get seats in the European Parliament, membership of the European Council or the right to appoint a commissioner, but they do have some influence over legislation.At the early stages they sit on committees at the European Commission, and they are entitled to submit comments on upcoming legislation.At a later stage, they can challenge a new law relating to the single market via the EEA Joint Committee, which includes representatives of the EU as well as the three countries.Through that body, they may secure exemptions from new laws and regulations.Could freedom of movement be restricted?EFTA members have to follow the four freedoms of the single market - freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.That means people from across the EU are free to live and work in EFTA countries, and people from EFTA countries can live and work across the EU.But the MPs promoting Common Market 2.0 have suggested that EFTA rules could allow freedom of movement to be restricted in exceptional circumstances."We would have critical new powers that we would unilaterally be able to bring in if we needed to, if a new country joined the EU, for example," Labour MP Lucy Powell told BBC News.But imposing restrictions on migrants from new EU member states is not a new power.All the existing EU states apart from the UK and Ireland temporarily imposed restrictions on the right to work for citizens of the eight countries that joined the bloc in 2004: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.The UK did the same to Romania and Bulgaria in 2007.Image copyright Getty Images Ms Powell's claim is based on Article 112-114 of the EEA Agreement, which says countries can take unilateral action if they are facing "serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties".The measures have to be taken in consultation with other EEA members, and reviewed every three months.The only EEA country that has managed to use this is Liechtenstein, which was allowed a restriction on freedom of movement based on it being a very small country, with a population that would only fill about half of Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium.There is considerable doubt that a country with the size, population and economy of the UK would be able to do the same thing.What about the European Court of Justice?Clearly, European Court of Justice (ECJ) rulings on single market matters would still be relevant to the UK, but the court would no longer have direct powers to rule on matters of European law arising in the UK.Instead, such issues would be heard by the EFTA Court, which has a judge from each of the member countries, so currently it has three judges and presumably if the UK were to join EFTA it would also get to nominate a judge.The EFTA Court tends to follow ECJ rulings closely.Also, its rulings are not legally binding on the member states, unlike the ECJ's.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Game of Thrones, hamsters and other things that didn't last as long as Brexit:::::Image copyright Getty Images/Alamy Whatever you think about Brexit - or even if you try not to think about it at all - we can probably all agree on one thing.It has gone on for a long, long time.We're more than 1,000 days on from when the UK voted to leave the European Union and it seems politicians are only just starting to enter the endgame.Maybe.The UK and the EU have now agreed on an extension to Brexit until 31 October, here are five things that don't - or didn't - last as long as Brexit.Building the Titanic Image copyright Getty Images Image caption ERROR: Metaphor not found Before it rose to international fame as the home of the backstop, Northern Ireland was legendary for many reasons.Among them, the construction of the Titanic.The mighty liner was built in Belfast - the keel was laid in 1909 and the ship launched just 26 months later - that's about 790 days.The Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in 1912.Similarly frozen and bigger than it appeared at first sight: the question of what happens to the Irish border in the future.The frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic will become the only land crossing between the UK and the EU - so there's huge controversy about what customs arrangements could be put in place.That, simply put, is the issue that's been stopping Theresa May's deal sailing through Parliament.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.Travelling to Mars Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mars yesterday Distant, lonely, red.Thirty-five million miles away from the House of Commons.Sounds idyllic, doesn't it?When Mars and Earth are closest together, it should take around 300 days to fly between them.So since the referendum in 2016, you'd have had time to get there, harvest an entire crop of potatoes like Matt Damon and bring them home to make Mars mash for your friends.And here's something that sounds like a distant planet but isn't: MV3.That stands for Meaningful Vote 3: Theresa May's planned third attempt to get MPs to back her deal.She's promised that if they do, she'll go.Not to Mars, just out of her job as prime minister.The entire plot of Game of Thrones Image copyright HBO/Sky Atlantic Image caption "He would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes" (said no-one about Brexit ever) Estimates vary, but all the events of the epic swords 'n' sorcery saga seem to take place over a period of around three or four years (around 1,100 - 1,400 days) And Brexit has packed in enough plot twists and backstabbing in the same timescale to make Lord Baelish look like a rank amateur.Allegiances have shifted, people have been double-crossed and deep-seated loyalties have been tested.Who will be sitting on the Iron Throne - and in 10 Downing Street - when the dust settles?Only one thing is certain: both battles are going to be messy.Your pet hamster Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Wait, what?The average lifespan of a hamster is around three years (around 1,100 days) So countless hamsters have lived out their entire lives knowing nothing but endless Brexit negotiations.Just think of that.Fun fact: hamsters are immigrants.They were native to Syria and Turkey before being bred domestically.They've been with us a while now though, so like EU citizens already living here they should be fine to stay after Brexit.Constructing the Eiffel Tower Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Who doesn't love Brexit in the springtime?How long does it take to build a proud, majestic symbol of national identity?Well, if you're French, around two years (a little more than 700 days).The Eiffel Tower was erected between 1887 and 1889.The tower was supposed to be dismantled after 20 years, but of course that never happened.Because, as Theresa May has discovered, plans can change.Especially where Europe is concerned.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitterand YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.
Brexit: What deal did MPs reject?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The withdrawal agreement is 585 pages long, while the political declaration is just 26 pages MPs have rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal for a third time.The government lost by 344 votes to 286, a majority of 58.But on this occasion there was a key difference: MPs only voted on the withdrawal agreement and not the political declaration.Previously, both of these were voted on and rejected.So, what are they?Withdrawal agreement This is the deal the UK government negotiated with the European Union, over 18 months, and it sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.First published in November, it is almost 600 pages long and some of the key areas it covers are: The transition Under the withdrawal agreement, the UK would enter into a 21-month transition period with the EU after Brexit.During this time the UK would continue to follow EU rules and remain in the single market and customs union to allow frictionless trade to continue.The UK would also lose membership of EU institutions.The transition period could be extended, but only for a period of one or two years.Money This is known as "the divorce bill" - the amount of money the UK would need to pay the EU to settle its obligations.Although no figure appears in the document, it is expected that the UK would pay at least 39bn over a number of years.The Irish backstop The most controversial part of the withdrawal agreement is the Irish backstop, which has proved to be the main reason it cannot command a majority in Parliament.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics The backstop is the insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland after Brexit.It would kick in at the end of the transition period in the event that a comprehensive trade deal, that avoids the needs for checks at the Irish border, is not reached between the UK and EU.The terms of the backstop would effectively place the UK into a temporary customs union with the EU.Critics worry that the UK could find itself trapped in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to pursue its own independent trade policy (signing trade deals with countries like the US).Citizens' rights During the transition period, UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would retain their residency and welfare rights after Brexit.The withdrawal agreement also allows citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK, of course) to be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.Political declaration The political declaration - also published in November - is all about the future relationship between the UK and the EU, after Brexit.This document is far shorter (just 26 pages) and, unlike the withdrawal agreement, it is not legally binding.Some of the keys areas it covers are: Trade The document calls on the trading relationship to be "as close as possible" and says there would be an "ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced" economic partnership.But it does not a set out what the final outcome for UK-EU trade will look like.Customs The political declaration refers to an "ambitious customs arrangement".The concern, from some, is that this could turn into a permanent arrangement that could prevent the UK from pursuing its own independent trade policy.The government dismisses this concern, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future.Irish border Technology and other alterative arrangements would be considered in order to keep the Irish border open with no physical infrastructure (eg border posts).However, presently, there is no border which the EU shares with a non-EU country that is entirely open and frictionless.Freedom of movement The UK, according to the document, would take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK (and UK citizens to the EU) would come to an end.The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: what is the withdrawal agreement?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 599 pages long.It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union.Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.Transition The transition period (which the UK government calls "implementation period") is due to last for 21 months.The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions.The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years.Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension.Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that.At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer.There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice.The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter.The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU.Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.Money The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or "divorce bill") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations.While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least 39bn and it will be paid over a number of years.Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period.In 2018/19 the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net 10.8bn.If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately.Chris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the "divorce bill" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible.Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU.Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.Citizens' rights This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March.UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit.Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.Chris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority.But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty.British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders after the transition period, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live.Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now are also unresolved issues.Northern Ireland/the backstop If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of "a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom" will be triggered.Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market.As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to "level playing field conditions", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory.The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU.Chris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border.But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods.That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent.The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.Fishing The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters.The document says: "The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."Chris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy.Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.Laws and disputes The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition.A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement.If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly.Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel.However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision.Chris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow.The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over.That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.What else is in it?Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus.There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled.EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like "Welsh Lamb" or "Parma Ham" remain.Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like.It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: Can Norway say no to the EU?:::::The claim: Norway, using its "right of reservation", has refused to implement the EU's Postal Services Directive.Reality Check verdict: While Norway initially notified the EU that it might opt out of the Third Postal Services Directive, it was adopted by the new coalition government in 2014.Nick Boles is one of the cross-party group of MPs that has been promoting the idea of Common Market 2.0, otherwise known as Norway plus, as a model for the UK's future relationship with the European Union, after Brexit.It was one of the alternatives to Theresa May's Brexit plan considered as part of the indicative votes process in Parliament on Wednesday, when it was defeated by 283 votes to 188.One of the key objections to the proposal is that Norway adopts the rules and regulations of the single market without having any seats on the European Parliament, membership of the European Council or the right to appoint a commissioner.Norway, along with Iceland and Liechtenstein, is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), but not of the EU itself.EEA members are part of the EU's single market.Asked about this in Parliament on Wednesday, Mr Boles told the House: "There is an absolutely crucial process for EEA members called the EEA joint committee."All new rules passed under single market legislation are referred to that committee and members of the EEA have a right of reservation, which means that the postal directive, for instance, has still never been implemented by Norway because they don't like it and they just say no."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg has said she may be prepared to help if the UK decides to pursue a Norway plus model The EEA joint committee does indeed get to scrutinise new EU rules and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have the right to opt out, but they have never done so."Although this 'safety valve' provision has never been used, Norway has considered invoking it a number of times and, legally speaking, there is no doubt that it can be used," Liv Monica Stubholt, partner at the Norwegian law firm Selmer, told Reality Check.The example Nick Boles used was the Postal Services Directive, which Norway said could be a reservation matter in 2011, but eventually accepted under a new coalition government in 2014.The directive introduced competition in postal services into areas that had previously generally been monopolies for national postal companies.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Norway was worried about how the directive could affect the viability of postal services in remote areas "While it's clear that states do have the right to opt out of new laws, the political costs for using it are considered to be potentially quite high, which is why it hasn't yet been used," Hanne Zimmer, from the Norwegian law firm Wikborg Rein, told Reality Check.While this has never been tested, the EU could impose sanctions under the EEA agreement such as suspending parts of the single market in ways that could be damaging to businesses in the country making the objections.Mr Boles told Reality Check: "I wasn't aware that Norway had ultimately accepted the postal directive but the broader point about the right of reservation still stands."In addition to the right of reservation to completely opt out, EEA members can also negotiate adaptations to new EU rules.While most of these are minor, technical points, there are a few examples of more significant changes, such as Norway's exemption from implementing EU rules on emergency exits in certain tunnels."Such examples are relatively rare, and the EU is generally reluctant to grant them except in very specific circumstances," Hanne Zimmer said.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: What John Bercow's intervention means for May's deal:::::Image copyright HoC Never afraid of stoking controversy, the Speaker has again infuriated many Tory MPs with his latest surprise pronouncement to the Commons.Just as it seemed the government was poised to try and get its Brexit deal through again, John Bercow took it upon himself to tick ministers off before they had even tried.Why?Because last week he ruled the deal could not be brought back to the Commons for a third time without "substantial" changes.Mr Bercow's intervention today suggests he doesn't think that test has yet been met.But No 10 disagrees and points to the additional backstop guarantees agreed at a summit in Strasbourg, and formally approved by the EU last week.It's clear the date of Brexit has changed too.It will be 22 May if the withdrawal agreement is passed by the Commons this week and 12 April if not - unless there is a further extension.With so little time, there is some incredulity around Parliament that the Speaker is sticking so rigidly to his ruling.The government was considering a procedural move that could have proved MPs wanted to have a vote, regardless of the parliamentary convention.But John Bercow said that wouldn't do.Hannah White from the Institute for Government said that while the Speaker is the ultimate authority on parliamentary procedure, "the government ought to be allowed to test the will of the House on whether to set aside its own rule".So what happens next?It still seems likely the government will have another crack at getting its deal through the Commons before Friday night.Tory opposition to the agreement seems to be crumbling at the same rate interest in alternative forms of Brexit is growing.Many Tory Brexit-enthusiasts who hate the withdrawal agreement are now very worried the indicative vote process might lead to a long extension and possibly no Brexit altogether.No 10 will only bring the deal back for a third vote if it thinks it could pass.That probably requires DUP backing and a guarantee some Labour MPs will vote for it too.As it stands, there isn't yet a majority for the deal, but the mood is shifting fast.It is possible the government attempts to pass the withdrawal agreement on its own - detaching the non-binding political agreement MPs are arguing over now from the terms of divorce.That may well satisfy the EU's deadline and allow MPs time to continue their wrangle over the sort of future relationship they want after Brexit.
Weary EU press say they're appalled by Brexit deadlock:::::Image copyright BBC Monitoring European newspapers say UK Prime Minister Theresa May's promise to quit if MPs back her Brexit deal - and the failure of Parliament to agree on any of the eight proposed alternatives - have plunged Britain deeper into paralysis.In Germany, Die Welt says "Mrs May plays her last card - her own job".It notes growing support for her proposed deal among MPs from her Conservative Party but says it remains doubtful that it will eventually be approved, adding: "The Brexit chaos in the British Parliament goes on."Similarly Germany's Bild speaks of the "chaos becoming even more confusing" after MPs rejected all eight alternative Brexit proposals.Der Spiegel magazine describes proceedings as "another day of chaos in Westminster".Image copyright Bild France's Le Figaro observes that Mrs May made a "Faustian pact" with Conservative MPs by offering to resign, but adds "on the other side of the Channel, Europeans are watching these developments with a feeling of weariness".Meanwhile, Le Monde's headline says: "The prospect of a no-deal increases by another notch."Image copyright Le Monde It recalls that French President Emmanuel Macron and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel "openly evoked it as an option" at a European Council meeting earlier this month.For Polish broadsheet Rzeczpospolita, last night's Brexit wrangling was the "Final humiliation of Theresa May"."For a moment, it seemed that the never-ending Brexit saga was over.But this illusion lasted for two hours tops" it said, referring to the continuing refusal by the Northern Irish DUP party, on whose support the Conservatives rely, to back Mrs May's deal.Image copyright Rzeczpospolita In a similar vein, La Libre Belgique says the votes, "far from bringing the awaited clarity, plunged the United Kingdom into confusion even more profoundly".Looking ahead, Belgium's Le Soir points out that the UK may face a "cordon sanitaire" setting it apart from the rest of the EU in case of a lengthy exit process."The hypothesis of a long delay to the UK's departure, for example for a year, will give the British an influence in the EU that the EU27 will do their best to limit," it notes.For Stephen Collins in the Irish Times, letting the UK hold another European election would be "disastrous" as the European Parliament already faces an upsurge of populist forces."There is a serious danger that the Brexiteers who have paralysed the House of Commons and undermined the reputation of British politics will take their wrecking tactics to the European Parliament if the United Kingdom is allowed to remain in the European Union for an extended period," he says."It is theoretically possible that European elections in the UK could provide a rallying point for those who want to remain in the EU or at least desire a softer Brexit The problem is that no party apart from the Liberal Democrats is committed to remaining in the EU so the odds must be that, as last time, the elections will be a vehicle for anti-EU forces to mobilise."BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.
Brexit: What are the options now?:::::MPs vote: What's next for Brexit?With MPs voting to take control of Commons business, what does this mean for government and how will it affect the Brexit process?
What do voters make of Brexit now?:::::Almost three years ago the UK voted in favour of leaving the EU.Yet the original departure date of 29 March has been delayed and the government is searching for a way forward.So, what do the majority of the UK's voters now think about Brexit?How well have talks been handled?Theresa May argues that her deal is the best way of fulfilling the instruction to leave given by voters in the EU referendum.Trouble is, voters themselves - including not least those who voted Leave - have become deeply critical of how the UK government has handled Brexit negotiations.This is seen in data from a newly published survey from NatCen Social Research, conducted between 24 January and 17 February.Two years ago, those who voted Leave were inclined to give the government the benefit of the doubt.However, as many as 80% of Leave voters now say that it has handled Brexit negotiations badly.That figure is almost as high as it is among Remain voters (85%), who had previously been more critical of the government's approach.Remarkably, Leave voters are now just as critical of the UK government's role as they are of the EU's: 79% of Leave supporters say the EU has handled Brexit badly.Will the UK get a good deal?Meanwhile, the longer negotiations have continued, the more pessimistic voters have become about how good a deal the UK will secure.Two years ago, there were almost as many who thought that the UK would obtain a good deal (33%) as thought it would find itself with a bad one (37%).However, that mood soon changed and by last summer as many as 57% reckoned the UK would emerge with a bad deal.Now that the first phase of the Brexit negotiations has been concluded - though, as yet at least, not approved by MPs - the proportion who think the UK is heading for a bad deal is, at 63%, even higher.Here too, Remain and Leave voters are now largely in agreement.This is despite Leave voters initially being much more positive.As many as 66% of Leave supporters now believe that the UK is faced with a bad deal - even more than the 64% of Remain voters who express that view.It seems that the prime minister's deal has failed to satisfy many of the very voters whose wishes the deal is intended to fulfil.Do UK voters still want to leave the EU?But does this negative reaction to the deal mean voters have changed their minds about leaving the EU in the first place?In truth, a moving average of the six most recent polls, has been indicating for some time that slightly more people now say they would vote Remain than Leave in another ballot.At present, the average level of support for the two options (after Don't Knows are excluded) is Remain 54%, Leave 46%.In part, this is because Leave voters are a little less likely to say they would vote the same way again (82%), than Remain voters are (86%).But the swing to Remain, such as it is, is also down to those who did not vote in 2016.Of this group, 43% say they would vote Remain, whereas 19% say they would back Leave.In truth, the polls are too close for opponents of Brexit to assume that a second ballot would produce a different result.But, equally, supporters of Brexit cannot say with confidence that the balance of opinion remains as it was in June 2016.More like this Do people support another referendum?So, do the UK's voters want another referendum?That depends on how they are asked.Some polls introduce the idea of another ballot as a "people's vote", or a "public vote" and do not make it clear that remaining in the EU would be an option.When put to the public in this way, the polls suggest on average that supporters of a second referendum outnumber opponents by 12 points.However, the average level of support and opposition changes when people are asked if there should be another referendum with Remain as an option on the ballot paper.Asked in this way, opponents outnumber supporters by nine points.But perhaps what is more important is that Remain voters are much keener on this idea than Leave supporters.That suggests the proposal is not yet a way out of the Brexit impasse that is backed by both sides in the Brexit debate.Remain and Leave voters may agree that they do not like Mrs May's deal, but that does not mean that they agree on what should happen instead.About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.It is partly based on research published by NatCen Social Research and the website WhatUKThinks.Sir John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University, senior fellow at NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.He is also chief commentator at WhatUKthinks.org.Edited by Duncan Walker Charts by David Brown
Brexit debate: Do petitions ever work?:::::More than five million people in the UK have signed a petition calling on the government to stop Brexit by revoking Article 50.It's the most popular petition to ever have been submitted on the UK Parliament's website - and historians say it is the biggest ever petition to parliament in history.But the government has ruled out cancelling Brexit, and rejected a previous petition for a second referendum.MP Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House of Commons, has dismissed the petition, saying it has far fewer signatories than the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU during the 2016 referendum.So do petitions ever achieve anything - and is there any point in signing one?"Petitions by themselves don't do anything, but they can be a very valuable tool for change," says Cristina Leston-Bandeira, a professor of politics at the University of Leeds, who specialises in petitions and public engagement.It all comes down to "how campaigners use the petition to put pressure on their representatives".Can petitions succeed?The petitions website Change.org says that, globally, one of its petitions secures a campaign victory ever hour.One of the campaigns it lists as a success is the 2015 petition to scrap the "tampon tax" - a sales tax on sanitary products - in the UK.The organiser, Laura Coryton, was a student when she started the petition - and made headlines after more than 320,000 people signed up.Image copyright Change.org Image caption Laura Coryton (centre right) started her first-ever petition in 2015 Months later, the government said it would try to change the relevant EU law so the tax could be removed.Many retailers also cut costs on sanitary products to shoulder the cost of the tax themselves.Ms Coryton says she did not expect her petition to be so popular, but believes it was helpful in allowing large numbers of people to document their desire for change."320,000 signatures is much harder to ignore than one person writing to their MP," she told the BBC.However, she's keen to stress while the petition helped attract attention, there were many more factors behind the campaign's success."So many people wrote to their MPs, started localised campaigns, or raised motions at their universities - it was definitely a combination of traditional campaigning methods and petitions at the same time."Another reason petitions can work is by raising awareness, says Bettina Siegel, a US blogger who led three petitions given "confirmed victory" status by Change.org.Ms Siegel is known for her campaign to stop the use of "pink slime" (lean beef trimmings made from fatty beef carcass off-cuts) in US school lunches, and also petitioned to block a McDonald's infomercial from local schools."In general, I think a petition can attract the attention of news media because it's a very tangible indication of public interest," she told the BBC.However, she adds: "A business is likely to be more responsive because they have a direct financial interest in pleasing their customers.I think it's more complicated when you're petitioning a government."Why do people sign petitions that are unlikely to succeed?It's fair to say that not all of the 5.6 million people behind the "Revoke Article 50" petition expect the government will suddenly agree to keep the UK in the EU.Image copyright EPA Image caption Hundreds of thousands took part in a "Put it to the People" march in London on Saturday But, people signing petitions for causes they think are unlikely to win is nothing new."A traditional historical feature of petitions is that many people will sign it without an expectation that it is necessarily something the government will turn around and agree to" right away, says Dr Richard Huzzey, a historian at Durham University leading a study into petitions.Instead, many signed petitions "out of a sense of duty and self-expression" and to "discharge their own personal sense of responsibility".They "hope it will draw attention [to the issue] and play a part in shifting the dynamic", he says.He points to a 1783 petition against slavery in the colonies - which was not abolished until 1833 - as an example of a petition that supporters would have signed without expecting any immediate change."Thinking about petitions in isolation misses the fact that historically they've been the lynchpin of broader activism and campaigns - they are very important but rarely a solution in their own right."What makes a modern petition successful?Both Ms Coryton and Ms Siegel believe that petitions work best when they are specific and asking for something "realistically achievable".For example, "ending sexism" is a great goal but too vague, whereas targeting the tampon tax addresses "a specific symptom of a sexist society", says Ms Coryton.Prof Leston-Bandeira argues that petitions don't have to dominate headlines, or attract millions of signatures, to be successful."If you have a system where petitions are integrated into policy processes, like parliamentary procedures or debate... they can really effect change."She points to the example of a petition into funding for brain tumour research, which sparked a petitions committee inquiry at a point when it only had about 14,000 signatures.Eventually it attracted 120,000 signatures, enabled the stories of many affected by brain tumours to be heard in parliament, and did lead to increased funding.Another petition, to give police dogs and horses more legal protections if they are attacked on duty, received 128,000 signatures.It was debated in parliament, and legislation, known as Finn's law, has now been approved in the House of Commons.Image copyright BCH Police Dogs Image caption German shepherd Finn was stabbed in the head and chest after pursuing a suspect in 2016 Prof Leston-Bandeira says petitions can be divided into "substantive" petitions - that tend to relate to specific policies to be changed, and "protest" petitions, which are more of an reaction or expression of dissatisfaction."Petitions on specific issues, that are non-partisan, are most likely to be successful," she says, especially if it raises an issue that lawmakers haven't thought about before.However, "protest" petitions can also be effective in less obvious ways.In 2017, more than 1.6 million people signed a petition calling for US President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK to be cancelled, and while Mr Trump still visited the UK, "it took a long time for him to come to the UK, and it was a much more low key type of visit than it would have been when it was first announced", she says.What does all this mean for the 'Revoke Article 50' petition?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 17.4 million people - 52% - voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum "The issue with this is it's very divisive - I wouldn't be surprised if there's a counter petition developing as we speak," says Prof Leston-Bandeira.However, she believes the petition is still "likely to apply pressure" and "shape the discourse" with the government."It will not achieve the revoking of Article 50 by itself, but it's another indicator, like the mass protest on Saturday, that MPs and the government will take into account."Even if millions more sign the petition, however, "it's not the same as people going to vote", given that all UK residents are able to sign the petition whether they are eligible to vote or not.A brief history of petitions Petitions are not a new thing - in fact there were one million petitions submitted to the UK's parliament between 1780 and 1918.Historians have suggested the first documented petitions were from slaves building pyramids in ancient Egypt, who tried to petition for better working conditions.Until this week, the biggest recorded petition to parliament was a petition against ambulance service cuts, in 1990, that attracted 4.5m signatures.Source: Dr Richard Huzzey, Durham University History department
Brexit votes: The lowdown on MPs' alternative plans:::::Image copyright Getty Images MPs are trying to forge a Brexit consensus as they debate and vote on alternatives to the government's EU withdrawal agreement.In an unprecedented show of strength by the Commons, MPs are wresting control of the parliamentary timetable from the government for a few hours to consider a range of other options and try to break the current deadlock.Commons Speaker John Bercow has chosen eight proposals, out of more than a dozen put forward by MPs, to be debated.It will then be up to MPs, when they fill in their ballot papers, to express an opinion on each of them.Any that secure the support of more than 50% of MPs could go forward to be debated again on Monday as Parliament tries to convince the government, and just as importantly the EU, that it has an alternative solution.Here's a brief rundown of proposals up for consideration and who's backing them.No-deal Brexit The general idea: It's a very straightforward motion: "That this House agrees that the UK shall leave the EU on 12 April 2019 without a deal."The key bits: It seeks to ensure that there will not be further delay to Brexit.Who's backing it?Conservative Brexiteers John Baron, Sir David Amess, Martin Vickers and Stephen Metcalfe A customs union The general idea: At least three motions were being circulated around Westminster which argue for the UK to negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU.The Speaker has selected the most straightforward one, tabled by veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke.The key bits: It does not argue for the UK to remain in the EU's current customs union.It says that any EU withdrawal agreement, and declaration on the future trading relationship, "must include, as a minimum, a commitment to negotiate a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU".Who's backing it?The cross-party proposal has the backing of a smattering of senior Conservative and Labour MPs, including Ken Clarke, Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper.Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button Labour's plan Image copyright PA The general idea: Aside from the customs union, the opposition's motion unarguably points in the direction of a "softer Brexit" while, the party insists, still honouring the result of the 2016 referendum.Labour argues that its proposal is negotiable with the EU - something its detractors contest.The key bits: The motion calls for "close alignment" with the single market, underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, and for the UK to be in harmony with laws on workers' rights and environmental protections.It seeks guarantees over the UK's continued participation in educational, scientific and cultural programmes and access to security and law enforcement schemes, including the European Arrest Warrant.Who backing it?It is being put forward by party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer.But it is unlikely to attract much support from other parties, particularly opposition parties who favour another referendum.Common Market 2.0 The general idea: Also known as "Norway plus", this motion takes as its starting point the Scandinavian country's relationship with the EU and seeks to build on it.It derives its name from the common market, the vernacular name for the European Economic Community (EEC) at the time the UK joined it in 1973.The key bits: The UK would reapply to join the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which it left when it signed up to the EEC.If successful, it would join what is known as the "EEA pillar" of the EFTA agreement.In essence, the UK would not leave the European Economic Area, to which it currently belongs as an EU member, and would continue to participate in the single market.It envisages a "comprehensive customs arrangement" with the EU until alternative arrangements are put in place and would maintain freedom of movement, albeit with conditions.Who's backing it?It is the brainchild of Tory MP Nick Boles, who has been championing it for nearly 18 months.It has the support of Brexiteer Tory Andrew Percy and a number of Labour MPs, including Stephen Kinnock.The Labour leadership has indicated it will order its MPs to vote for this, increasing its chances of success.EFTA/EEA The general idea: This is similar in some respects to Common Market 2.0 but with a number of important differences.While the UK would rejoin EFTA and stay within the EEA, it makes clear the UK's rights and obligations would be enforceable by the domestic courts, not the European Court of Justice.The key bits: It rejects any kind of customs union with the EU after Brexit and says the Irish backstop must be replaced with alternative arrangements to preserve the territorial integrity of the UK.Who's backing it?It has been drawn up by George Eustice, who quit as a minister last month to vote against delaying Brexit.It is largely a Tory affair but does draw support from "soft Brexiteers" like Nicky Morgan and Jeremy Lefroy and members of the Brexit Delivery Group of MPs.Confirmatory referendum The general idea: This one is pretty straightforward.It says Parliament cannot ratify or implement any agreement on the UK's withdrawal and future relationship "unless and until they have been approved by the people of the UK in a confirmatory public ballot".The key bits: It basically requires Parliament to withhold its consent for any deal until it is approved in a referendum.Unlike Labour's motion, it does not specify what deal could be voted on or whether there should be an option to remain, thereby differentiating itself from the People's Vote campaign.Who's backing it?This was known around Westminster as the Kyle-Wilson amendment, as it's the idea of Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, but it has been tabled by Labour MP Dame Margaret Beckett.They have a long list of Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Independent Group supporters, and a smattering of Tory rebels.Revoking Article 50 The general idea: This requires the government to stop Brexit in its tracks if the UK gets to within days of its scheduled departure from the EU and the necessary legislation implementing any withdrawal deal has not been approved.The key bits: Talk of revoking Article 50 - the legal process by which the UK is leaving the EU - has been all the rage in the past week, with a petition backing the move attracting more than five million signatures.This motion obliges the government to act if the UK reaches "the penultimate House of Commons sitting day before exit day" and no law implementing Brexit has been passed.In such a situation, MPs would be asked to vote on a no-deal exit and if they rejected that, Article 50 would be revoked.Who's backing it?The prime mover is the Scottish lawyer and SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who was behind a legal challenge earlier this year to establish whether the UK could unilaterally revoke Article 50.Its supporters include Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and members of the Independent Group of MPs.Malthouse compromise Plan B The general idea: This looks a bit like the "managed no-deal" plan that was being touted by some cabinet Brexiteers.It would see an extended transition period to December 2021 to allow time to prepare for departure on World Trade Organisation terms or a revised version of the withdrawal agreement.The key bits: It would seek to reduce the 39bn "divorce bill" to the smallest amount possible - and introduce a "standstill period" with no tariffs and no new barriers to trade with the EU while talks are ongoing.The first part of the plan, Malthouse Plan A, which called for the current withdrawal agreement to be implemented with the "backstop" for the Irish border replaced by alternative arrangements, which had cross-party support, was not selected for debate Commons Speaker John Bercow.Who's backing it?Mostly Conservative Brexiteers, including Marcus Fysh, Steve Baker and Priti Patel.
Brexit: What are indicative votes?:::::Image copyright UK Parliament MPs have decided to try to break the Brexit deadlock by holding a series of "indicative votes".But what does it mean?Indicative votes are where MPs vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority.In the case of Brexit, supporters of indicative votes believe it could provide a way out of the current political stalemate.How will it work?Usually the government has control over what happens day-to-day in Parliament, but on Monday evening MPs backed a proposal by a cross-party group of MPs, including Labour's Hilary Benn and Conservative Sir Oliver Letwin, to take control of the timetable.Under the cross-party plan, MPs can put forward their preferred Brexit plans this evening to Speaker John Bercow.Tomorrow he will select all or some of these options for debate.MPs may be asked to consider whether any plan agreed by Parliament should be put back to the public in another referendum, or whether the UK should stop Brexit altogether by revoking its notification of Article 50.Following a debate on the various options, at 7pm the Commons will be suspended for 30 minutes so MPs can vote on the each plan.During the indicative votes, MPs will enter one of the division lobbies - the corridors in the House of Commons where votes are normally counted - and will receive a paper ballot.They can vote "yes" or "no" on as many options as they are prepared to support.The results will be announced by the Speaker later that evening.After the results are in and options are narrowed, a second round of voting could also take place next Monday to find a single preference.It is unclear if the voting system will remain the same for this.Among the possible ideas are: Would MPs be forced to vote a particular way?Usually, MPs are instructed to vote with their party line (a process known as "whipping") and they can face repercussions if they don't.But with indicative votes, MPs might be allowed "free votes" - where they can choose to vote as they wish - meaning the final outcome could be substantially different.Government ministers have indicated free votes are likely.Does it tie the government's hands?Any decision taken by indicative votes would not compel the government into pursuing that course of action, but would show what Parliament wants and where the most votes lie.However, there is always a risk that either no single Brexit option secures a majority, or more than one does.If this happens then Parliament would still find itself deadlocked over Brexit.If certain options such as Norway plus or another referendum are chosen and enacted by the government, it would require a longer extension to Article 50.The Prime Minister Theresa May has also warned that the votes could lead to an outcome which the EU would not agree to.Have they happened before?Yes.One occasion indicative votes were used was in 2003 when MPs were presented with seven different options on how to reform the House of Lords.It produced exactly the deadlock some fear would be the case over Brexit as nothing was able to secure a majority.This meant reforms were not passed and the status quo prevailed.But haven't MPs already voted on all the options?MPs have had a number of opportunities to vote on different ways forward, and, as Mrs May has pointed out, they have "equally been rejected".But these were all "whipped" votes and each proposal was taken in isolation, rather than side by side.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: How could another referendum on leaving the EU work?:::::Image copyright Getty Images With Parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, EU leaders have agreed to Theresa May's request to delay the UK's departure date for a second time.Under the plan, the UK is now scheduled to leave on 31 October 2019.One option to break the political stalemate, could be to offer the public a new Brexit vote.The Electoral Commission has told BBC News it has "contingency plans in place" and is ready "to respond quickly to any unscheduled poll".So how would another referendum on the UK's membership of the EU work?Passing the legislation To allow a referendum to happen, legislation would first of all need to be passed in Parliament.This would set the rules of the poll and the regulation of the campaign.That would mean the majority of MPs would need to support the idea of holding another vote.It took seven months before Parliament signed off the previous legislation which led to the 2016 referendum.But could it be done more quickly this time?One possible option is to use the 2015 Act as a template and, in effect, copy over large chunks to speed the process up."This could be done very quickly in theory," says Alan Renwick, deputy director of the Constitution Unit at University College London.If it were shortened in this way, Mr Renwick estimates it would still take about 11 weeks to get through Parliament.Based on that timetable, it would take until late June for the bill to be passed - and that's if the process started now.But the legislation could take much longer to pass if there was a lot of disagreement amongst MPs.For example, should there be multiple options on the ballot paper, as opposed to the straightforward choice of "Leave" or "Remain" in 2016?The question In the end it would be up to Parliament to decide what the question might be.The People's Vote campaign, which wants a referendum on a final Brexit deal, says a choice between the deal and remaining in the EU is their preference but it doesn't rule out the possibility of voters having three options.Justine Greening, a former Conservative cabinet minister who supports another referendum, has previously called for three choices when people come to vote: accept a negotiated Brexit deal stay in the EU leave with no deal On the other hand, some argue that if there was to be another vote, "Remain" should not appear on the ballot paper and it should be a straight choice between a Brexit deal and leaving the EU with no deal.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Justine Greening favours a second referendum and says voters should have three options If there were several options, MPs would also need to decide what voting system to use - ie would voters make one choice or vote in order of preference?The Electoral Commission would also need to test the proposed question and ensure it was presented "clearly, simply and neutrally".The campaign Once the legislation is passed, official campaign groups would have to be selected.The Commission would need to provide information to voters about how to take part in the referendum and ensure there were enough counting officers in place around the country.Once that's out the way, there's the campaign - which usually lasts four weeks - and the vote itself.The Electoral Commission told BBC News all of this would take a minimum of 10 weeks - from passing the legislation to holding the vote, as set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.So adding together the time to pass the legislation and organising a campaign, the process would take a minimum of 22 weeks says Alan Renwick.The 10-day referendum But it's not unheard of for countries to hold referendums on much tighter timescales.Three years ago, Greece organised a referendum in just over a week, in which voters rejected the terms of an international bailout following the country's debt crisis.However, Alan Renwick says that if referendums are organised too hastily, it can give the impression that "normal procedure is not being followed" and that voters may see the eventual result as illegitimate.A referendum similar to Greece's timescale, for example, would not allow enough time to organise postal votes and assess the question on the ballot paper.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Article 50: Can the UK revoke Brexit?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Prime Minister Theresa May has been granted another Brexit delay by European Union (EU) leaders with a new deadline date of 31 October.European Council President Donald Tusk said the UK should use the extra time to either pass the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the UK and the EU, rethink its strategy or "cancel Brexit altogether."If the UK chose this last option, it would mean revoking something called Article 50.Article 50 This is the part of the Lisbon Treaty which sets out what happens when a country decides that it wants to leave the EU.It was triggered by Theresa May on 29 March 2017, starting a two-year countdown to leaving - although this period has now been extended twice.A petition calling for Article 50 to be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit - has been signed by more than six million people.But Theresa May has said that it should not be revoked.How could Article 50 be revoked?The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling last year confirmed that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission.This could be done by writing a letter to the European Council, made up of EU heads of state.The ECJ said the UK would then remain a member of the EU on the same terms - as it has now - including keeping its budget rebate.But it did set some conditions.The ruling said revocation should be "unequivocal and unconditional", suggesting that the UK could not simply revoke Article 50 in order to buy more time and then resubmit it at a later date.A senior lawyer at the ECJ said that "appropriate legal instruments" could be used if a member state tried to trigger and revoke Article 50 in order to secure a better withdrawal deal.Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button Who decides?Theresa May or Parliament?On this, the ECJ did not give a definitive answer.The court ruled that: "Revocation must be decided following a democratic process in accordance with national constitutional requirements."The UK government has a power known as the Royal Prerogative, which allows it to do certain things including deploying armed forces, granting honours and altering international treaties without consulting Parliament.So it is possible in theory that Mrs May would be able to revoke Article 50 without giving MPs the chance to vote on it.But there are limits to that power, and those limits have been tested during the course of the Brexit process.Their use to activate the two year Article 50 negotiating period was challenged by Gina Miller at the beginning of 2017.The Supreme Court ruled in her case that the government could not trigger the EU exit process without bringing it before Parliament.Because an act of Parliament was required to trigger Article 50, it has been suggested revoking it would also need parliamentary approval."The balance of opinion is that the safest and most secure legal route is to enact a very short piece of legislation to authorise the prime minister to revoke," according to Kenneth Armstrong, professor of European law at the University of Cambridge.Although some lawyers believe a letter from the prime minister would do.That's if Theresa May were to make the decision - but what if Parliament wanted to force her hand?They could potentially do this by taking control of Parliamentary business, as happened last month enabling Labour MP Yvette Cooper to pass legislation compelling the Prime Minister to seek a Brexit extension.In the same way, if there were a majority to do so, MPs might be able to instruct the Prime Minister to revoke Article 50.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: Can May still bring back her deal after Bercow statement?:::::Image copyright EPA Here is the relevant commandment from Erskine May aka the parliamentary bible: "A motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session, may not be brought forward again during that same session."So, how can the government get round this rather large obstacle and get another vote on Theresa May's deal?Change the rules... Well, first of all, rules are there to be changed.If MPs suspend or change the "standing orders" of Parliament, they could get the Brexit deal back on the agenda.But here the power would be in the hands of Parliament as a whole, and could not be done at the whim of government ministers.Change the offer... Secondly, the government could change the proposition on offer.The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has suggested that something "substantially" different would be to ask Parliament to vote for the deal subject to a referendum.It may be argued too that moving the Brexit date from 29 March to a later date would be substantial enough if Mrs May tacks this on to her deal.But the Speaker can set a high bar here.In response to MPs' questions, he has hinted that simply coming up with new legal advice or clarifications wouldn't be substantial enough.Change the Parliament...So, already there is a focus on the word "session" in Erskine May.If MPs can't discuss the same thing in the same session of Parliament, why not simply start a new one?In the parlance, Parliament would be "prorogued" - in other words, the Queen would end the current session and a new one would begin soon after.But this strategy would be extremely controversial, and may even be resisted by Buckingham Palace if it appeared that the monarchy was being used in a politically contentious way.
Brexit: Does the UK need to hold European elections?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It is becoming a key question in this complex Brexit process.If the UK was to request, or be offered, a lengthy extension of its membership of the European Union (EU), would there be an obligation to take part in May's European elections?Both the UK government and the European Commission (EC) say that there would; but legal opinion is divided, and many lawyers argue that a satisfactory fix could be found.The elections are taking place between 23 and 26 May, although the new parliament will not sit, and new members will not be sworn in, until 2 July.That is why it has been argued that an extension of Article 50 until the end of June would not prove to be a problem.But what about a much longer extension - potentially as long as 21 months until the end of 2020?That takes the debate into much trickier legal and political territory.The issue has taken on renewed relevance after the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, wrote in a tweet that he will appeal to the 27 other EU leaders over the next few days "to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy".What does the government say?Theresa May has indicated that she would only favour a "short technical extension" to the UK's EU membership, if that was necessary in order to turn a last-minute agreement into law.But a longer extension, she told MPs, "would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament (EP) elections in May 2019".And the European Commission agrees?Yes - as the "guardian of the treaties", the Commission has strong views on this.In a letter to Mr Tusk on March 11, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said that if the UK is still part of the EU at the end of May "it will be legally required to hold these elections, in line with the rights and obligations of all Member States as set out in the Treaties".There is no question that the UK would be in breach of those treaty obligations if it failed to hold elections.But how much would that matter, if the UK was on a path out of the EU anyway?What do others think?That is an unresolved debate that may eventually have to be tested in court.A legal opinion issued by the German Bundestag's Europe Department says that Article 50 cannot be extended beyond the end of May unless the UK holds elections.It suggests that the European Commission might choose to begin treaty infringement proceedings against the UK for denying the vote to UK or EU citizens in the UK.The UK's Department for Exiting the European Union argues that the UK would have to take part in the elections because "the EU Treaties provide that EU citizens have the right to be represented" and the European Parliament "needs to be properly constituted with duly elected representatives from all Member States" in order to perform its functions.But others disagree.A confidential legal opinion, written by the European Parliament's own legal service and seen by the BBC, argues that the new parliament could be legally constituted even if the UK had not taken part in the elections."The potential infringement by a Member State of its duties and responsibilities under the Treaties and the Electoral Act cannot amount," the opinion says, "to an absolute bar to the regular functioning of the Institution."So what happens next?If the UK didn't take part in the elections, there would be considerable concern about legal challenges, either from those who might argue that their right to be represented was being denied, or from those who might argue that the UK was paying money into the EU budget without receiving all the benefits.But representation is not necessarily the same thing as holding elections.When countries join the EU, there have been periods when national MPs have been appointed to serve as representatives in the European Parliament until the next European elections take place.This happened with Romania and Bulgaria in 2007.Could a similar temporary measure apply as an existing EU member seeks to leave?Perhaps.Another alternative that has been suggested is that the UK's current MEPs could continue to sit in the next European Parliament until the end of the Article 50 period, or they could be granted some form of observer status.All of this is uncharted legal territory.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jean-Claude Juncker says the UK "will be legally required to hold these elections" if it is still part of the EU at the end of May But the UK's most senior lawyer at the European Court of Justice, Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston, seems convinced that a solution can be found.There would be a need, she wrote on Twitter, "to arrange for British MEPs to sit in the new (parliament) as additional members on a temporary 'Brexit-limited' basis".Any suggestion that the European elections represent an "insuperable obstacle" to a longer extension of Article 50 is, she added, "an oversimplified and ultimately fallacious presentation of the facts".Ms Sharpston emphasised that she was writing in a personal capacity, but her opinion clearly carries some weight."If the political will to agree a longer extension of Article 50 is there, she concluded, "a legal mechanism can be found to accommodate that desire and 'deal with' the issue of the EP elections."Article 50 A legal solution could be found within Article 50 itself.It is already being used to offer the UK an extensive transition period after Brexit, even though it does not mention transition explicitly."An argument could be made that extending existing MEPs also qualifies as a transitional arrangement," says Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, "The formal position is that the UK would need to hold elections," Prof Barnard says."But it is likely that those MEPs would only serve for a maximum of two years, so it would be in the interest of both sides to find a creative solution."One possibility is to see how far Article 50 can be stretched."Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: What votes does Theresa May need for her deal to pass?:::::Image copyright Reuters Theresa May will put her Brexit deal to the House of Commons later for a second "meaningful vote" as she seeks approval for her updated plan.Last time the prime minister put her deal to MPs, she lost by a historic 230 votes.What support does Mrs May need to ensure her Brexit deal passes tonight?The magic number of MPs the prime minister needs to back her deal is 318 - that is if everyone who can vote does so.When MPs voted on the deal in January, 432 voted against, but 202 voted in favour.That means, if there are no abstentions from the vote later - when an MP does not vote either way - Mrs May needs to convince 116 more MPs from any side of the House to change their minds and support her.Persuading the rebels There were 118 Tory rebels who voted against the deal last time, but three of them - Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston - have now left the party and joined the Independent Group, who are expected to vote against the deal.So even if Mrs May persuaded the other 115 Conservative rebels to toe the party line, she would still be one short of securing her deal.The PM may have been hoping to convince the 10 members of the Democratic Unionist Party - her confidence-and-supply partners in the Commons who, in normal cases, give her a working majority - to change their minds and vote for a deal.But earlier, a statement from the party confirmed they would be voting against it.Hope from the opposition?There may be hope for the PM from the Labour benches.Although the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he and his MPs will vote against, it is thought some have been convinced to back the deal and vote in favour.This could cancel out the need for DUP votes to get it through, but only if there are no Conservative rebels.And here is where the European Research Group - the Conservative Brexiteer backbenchers who also voted down her deal in January - could come into play.We are still waiting to hear from some of the major figures in the group on which way they will go later.But a number of members have already rejected the deal, meaning the PM is unlikely to get a clean slate from her own benches.We will know shortly after the vote at 19:00 GMT tonight whether the magic number has been reached or not.
Brexit: 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal:::::Image copyright Getty Images The EU has said Brexit can be delayed from 29 March by two weeks, with that date being pushed back further if Theresa May's withdrawal agreement gets through Parliament.But if MPs still don't agree on it, the UK has to propose a way forward - and European Council President Donald Tusk has said that the UK government would face "a choice between a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50".With all options still on the table, how would you be affected if the UK leaves the EU with no deal?1.The contents of your shopping basket may change What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects.About 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more expensive in the event of no deal.Increased import taxes and transport delays could all mean a rise in prices.And if a no-deal Brexit was followed by a fall in the value of the pound, that would also have the same effect.Supermarkets themselves have already warned that there could be empty shelves and higher prices.And Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that, in a worst-case scenario, our shopping bills could increase by 10%.The government has said that while a no-deal Brexit alone won't lead to food shortages, consumer behaviour could.Panic buying could mean food retailers run short of some products.Supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg.2.You will need to take extra measures when travelling to Europe Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe.If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork.Flights and Eurostar The government and the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) have both said that flights to and from the UK would still operate in a no-deal scenario.And Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensure their services run as smoothly as possible, despite a government assessment that warned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK.Visas In terms of paperwork, you won't need a visa for stays in countries in the Schengen area - where passports are not required and all other types of border control have been abolished (full list here) - of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period.However, you may need a visa if you intend to stay for longer.Passports Image copyright PA The government is also advising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months if you are travelling to the Schengen area.Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document.But the government has now warned that this time carried over will not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit.You can check if your passport has enough time left with this government tool.For countries that are in the EU but not in the Schengen area (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), you'll need to check the entry requirements for the country you're travelling to before you travel.Travel to Ireland is subject to separate Common Travel Area arrangements, which will remain the same after the UK leaves the EU.Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (the European Economic Area), the government has warned that it may become more expensive.European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, then in theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist.The government is advising travellers to buy insurance to cover health care "just as you would if visiting a non-EU country".Driving If you intend to drive in the EU after exit, you may need an International Driving Permit and a green card from your insurer.3.You may need to check medication is available and it may be more expensive Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU.Measures taken include: a six-week stockpile of essential medicines a plane chartered to fly in medical devices and clinical consumables that can't be stockpiled warehouses with refrigeration capacity rented ports other than Dover and Folkestone prepared to take ferries with lorries carrying imported medical supplies However, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society warned in January that pharmacists were struggling to obtain common medicines - including painkillers and anti-depressants.While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there are concerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse.Pharmacists have advised patients to order medicines in advance to give them time to deal with requests.And the Royal College of Radiologists has told doctors to prepare for delays in some drugs used to detect cancer, by reducing their workload in the days after the UK leaves the EU.4.UK nationals living abroad may have to take extra measures About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries.The government is advising UK nationals living in the EU, the EEA or Switzerland to take steps to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.These will differ according to the country being lived in.The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country.There is country-specific government advice here.Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU.If you are eligible, you should register for healthcare under your country's local rules.You may have to be a long-term legal resident or pay social security contributions to access free or discounted healthcare.The government recommends you get health insurance while you are applying for residency.UK students studying abroad are also advised to buy health insurance.Information on how to access healthcare abroad can be found on the NHS website.Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU.Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements.These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income/gain, and determine which country has primary taxing rights.5.EU citizens need to apply for 'settled status' The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members who are living in the UK.There are currently 3.8 million EU citizens living in the UK.If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has a tool to find out what you need to do and when.Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button 6.Importing goods from the EU may get more expensive Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure.As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU.But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply.Earlier this month, the government published a 1,477-page document outlining their plan for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Under the temporary scheme, 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access.At the moment 80% of imports are tariff free.Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture.Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection.7.House prices could be affected Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market.UK house prices grew at the slowest annual rate for nearly six years in January, according to the Nationwide.It said it was likely that the recent slowdown in the market was due to "the impact of the uncertain economic outlook on buyer sentiment".The Bank of England says the impact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant.It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a "disorderly Brexit".Property agents Savills suggest buyer confidence will have a bigger role to play than affordability in house price movements this year.8.Mobile phone roaming charges may rise Using your mobile in the EU may be more expensive in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government has warned.The amounts EU mobile operators would be able to charge UK operators for providing roaming services would no longer be regulated after Brexit.Digital, Culture and Media Secretary Jeremy Wright has said although mobile operators will be able to implement roaming charges if they want to, the government would be legislating to put a 45-a-month limit on the amount customers could be charged.To be safe, the government advises you to understand how to turn off data roaming on your mobile if you are worried about being charged.9.Some ports and motorways could see extra delays Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said there could be freight traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no deal, if additional customs checks are introduced in Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk - where freight services disembark.At the moment, freight vehicles going through Dover are subject to passport and security checks.But under a no-deal scenario, EU-bound lorries will also need to complete customs declarations, and certain goods may also require physical checks, and this could lead to bottlenecks.In this scenario, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20.Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side.If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used.Kent County Council says it has employed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal.10.UK students studying in the EU and EU students studying in the UK face a period of uncertainty More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17.UK universities say they would expect a similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.The government is committed to funding everything already agreed, so people who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them.But if the UK leaves the EU without a deal before the exchanges for the next academic year have been finalised, then the government would need European agreement to keep taking part.It has issued a technical note explaining this.That is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK.Meanwhile, Universities UK has launched a campaign supporting opportunities for studying abroad.Remind yourself of the Brexit basics with: .
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Further reading: The rise of the word Brexit Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges.Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does the European Union work?When is the UK due to leave the EU?The UK had been due to leave on 29 March 2019, two years after it started the exit process by invoking Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty.But the withdrawal agreement reached between the EU and UK has been rejected three times by UK MPs.EU leaders agreed to extend the Article 50 process further and the current Brexit date is 12 April 2019.However, Theresa May has again requested an extension until 30 June - which EU leaders will consider on 10 April.So is Brexit definitely happening?As things stand, the UK is due to leave the European Union on 12 April, 2019, regardless of whether there is a deal with the EU or not.But could Brexit be cancelled?Yes.Stopping Brexit would require a change in the law in the UK, something neither the government nor the main UK opposition parties want to do at this point.The European Court of Justice ruled on 10 December 2018 that the UK could cancel the Article 50 Brexit process without the permission of the other 27 EU members, and remain a member of the EU on its existing terms, provided the decision followed a "democratic process", in other words, if Parliament voted for it.In March, an online petition calling for Article 50 to be revoked gained over six million signatures.Could Brexit be delayed?Possibly.EU leaders have asked the UK to "indicate a way forward" before 12 April, and have scheduled an emergency summit two days earlier on 10 April.Theresa May has said she does not want to ask for a longer extension, which would mean the UK has to take part in European Parliamentary elections.But EU leaders rejected her previous request for a 30 June extension and a longer extension may be the only thing offered by EU leaders.All EU leaders must agree to it if the Article 50 process is to be extended further.Could there be another referendum?It would have to be put into law by the government, which has previously ruled it out.But having failed three times to get MPs to support her withdrawal deal, Theresa May has held talks with Jeremy Corbyn about finding a way forward.Some Labour MPs want Mr Corbyn to make a "confirmatory vote" on any deal a condition of any agreement.If Labour and the Conservatives fail to reach an agreement, MPs will face a series of votes on Brexit options, which could include another referendum.Mrs May has said her government "stands ready to abide by the decision of the House" if Labour does the same.MPs have twice rejected a "confirmatory vote" in Commons votes although the second attempt saw an increased number back it.Why do politicians want a deal?The main point of having a deal between the UK and the EU is to ensure as smooth as possible an exit from the EU for businesses and individuals - and to allow time for the two sides to hammer out a permanent trading relationship.What is in Theresa May's deal with the EU?After months of negotiation, the UK and EU agreed a Brexit deal.It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement.This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated 39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border.A 26-page statement on future relations.This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.What is the transition period?This is part of the withdrawal agreement, which so far, has not been approved by MPs.It refers to a period of time after Brexit until 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin.It would also allow more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out.Free movement would continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted.The UK would be able to strike its own trade deals - although they wouldn't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.But it all rests on the withdrawal deal being ratified.Could we leave without a deal?Yes.This is the so-called no-deal Brexit.What would happen if the UK left without a deal?The UK would sever all ties with the EU with immediate effect, with no transition period and no guarantees on citizens' rights of residence.The government fears this would cause significant disruption to businesses in the short-term, with lengthy tailbacks of lorries at the channel ports, as drivers face new checks on their cargos.Food retailers have warned of shortages of fresh produce and the NHS is stockpiling medicines, in case supplies from EU countries are interrupted.Government ministers and multinational companies with factories in the UK have also warned about the long-term impact on the British economy.Brexit-supporting MPs claim it would not be as bad as they say and the UK would save on the 39bn divorce bill, as well as being free to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal' Would trade with the EU continue?The World Trade Organization sets rules for countries that don't have free trade deals with each other, including tariffs - the taxes charged on the import of goods.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would trade with the EU under World Trade Organization rules.Here is a full explanation of what that would mean.Is Theresa May's Brexit deal now dead?Theresa May's deal cannot come into effect until it has been passed by Parliament.It has now been heavily defeated in two "meaningful" votes, and a third vote just on the withdrawal agreement itself, governing the terms of the UK's departure, not the "future relationship", a non-binding bit of the deal which maps out aspirations for long-term trade, economic and security cooperation and more.She has told EU leaders that her cross-party talks with Labour are "based on acceptance of the withdrawal agreement without reopening it" - with the aim of getting it - and a "shared vision for the future relationship", which could be subject to some change, approved by the Commons.So she has not ruled out having another go at getting it ratified - and hopes that reaching out to Labour can help break the deadlock.There is a separate sticking point about whether Speaker John Bercow will allow her to bring the deal back again for another vote.What is the backstop?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop When the UK leaves the EU, the 310-mile border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will become the land border between the UK and the European Union.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people.But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a "backstop" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop agreed between the two parties would keep Northern Ireland aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.That would prevent the need for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.The backstop would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.If future trade talks broke down without a deal, the backstop would apply indefinitely.The arrangement would end only with the agreement of both the UK and the EU.Why are so many MPs against it?The backstop was a key sticking point for many MPs who voted down the deal.They feared it could leave Britain tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and no ability to strike trade deals with other countries.Are there any solutions to it?If there were an obvious solution that people agreed guaranteed no return of a hard border in Ireland it would probably have been implemented by now.Possible alternatives suggested include a "trusted trader" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border, "mutual recognition" of rules with the EU and "technological" solutions.However the EU has insisted that the backstop plan is necessary.Ask me Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.She triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Is she safe as prime minister?Theresa May has been in a precarious position because she lost her House of Commons majority in the 2017 general election.She has survived two attempts to remove her from office so far.The first, in December 2018, was from a group of her own MPs unhappy at her Brexit policy, who organised a no confidence vote in her as Conservative leader.She survived by 200 votes to 117.She is now immune from another attempt to oust her as Tory leader until December 2019.The second was from the Labour Party, who held a no confidence vote in her government after her Brexit plan was voted down in January 2019.All MPs were able to take part in this and she survived by 19 votes.Unlike the internal Tory no confidence vote, there is no limit to the number of times she could face a confidence vote in Parliament and Labour have not ruled out holding further ones.However Mrs May herself has told Tory MPs she will resign, if MPs back her deal, so someone else can lead the next phase of Brexit negotiations, so her time in the top job is limited.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Image copyright PA Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen.But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election.In February, it said it was prepared to back another EU referendum, to prevent a "damaging Tory Brexit", having failed to win a vote of no-confidence against the government.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now.This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a "hard border" in Northern Ireland.He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules.He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market.Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.IF THERE IS A DEAL WITH THE EU What happens to EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens in the EU?An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts.UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules.Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement.Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal.How will EU citizens apply for the new status?The UK government is launching an online system to allow EU citizens to apply for settled status on 30 March.The government had originally planned to charge people 65 to use it but that fee has now been dropped and it is free.Anyone who had already paid, when the scheme was being tested, will be reimbursed.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK?Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of about two years.There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections.The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What exactly happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, but the proposal is for a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals (see below).Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration.She has insisted the UK government remains committed to reducing annual net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving - to below 100,000.Home Secretary Sajid Javid has declined to commit to this, however.Instead, he has said it will be brought down to "sustainable" levels.Mr Javid published the government's long-awaited post-Brexit immigration plans in December.Free movement of people from the EU will effectively continue until the end of the transition period in December 2020.After that, people from the EU will need visas to work in the UK, with priority given to skilled workers - the same system that currently applies to migrants from outside the EU.A consultation is being held on a minimum salary requirement of 30,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas.However, tens of thousands of low-skilled migrants could come to the UK to work for up to a year to protect parts of the economy that rely on overseas labour.That measure would last until 2025.Visitors from the EU will not need visas.More details here.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?No.Under the Brexit deal, EU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in December 2020.After this period ends, the European Commission has offered visa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return.British citizens will, however, have to pay 7 (6.30) every three years to travel to EU countries, because of a new security system for countries in the passport-free Schengen zone.Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.Could the transition period be extended?If no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead.This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once.The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be.Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.IF THERE IS A NO-DEAL BREXIT Will EU nationals have to leave the UK?Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.It's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What about Brits living in EU countries?There is uncertainty about what no deal would mean for Britons living in France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere.The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country.More details here.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?If the UK leaves without a deal, British citizens who travel to the EU for up to 90 days will not have to apply for a visa - as long as the UK grants reciprocal visa-free travel for all EU citizens in return.The law confirming this arrangement has been adopted by the European Parliament, and now awaits the final sign-off from EU countries.It would come into force whenever the UK leaves the EU, regardless of whether a withdrawal agreement is reached.In the longer term, the EU is planning to launch an electronic application form, called ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System), for many non-EU countries, including the UK.It would involve paying a fee of 7 (6.30) every three years.More details here What about healthcare rights?Image copyright Thinkstock No deal would mean the current reciprocal healthcare, shared by the UK and the EU27, would no longer apply.It could send health insurance premiums soaring for UK citizens who need sufficient cover for holidays or work in the EU.Britons could also find their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) - a passport to emergency medical treatment - is no longer valid in some EU countries.Read more here What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?All existing EU laws will be copied across into UK law, to prevent legislative "black holes", under the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal Bill).The UK government can then decide over a period of time which ones it wants to keep, change or ditch.SOME KEY BREXIT QUESTIONS Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Has immigration come down since the UK voted to leave the EU?According to the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics, net migration to the UK from non-EU countries was 261,000 in the twelve months to September 2018 - the highest since 2004.By contrast, net migration from EU countries was 57,000 - a level last seen in 2009.In other words, the result of the referendum appears to have already had an impact before Brexit has actually happened.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The 39bn "divorce bill" will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its "strict international legal obligations".Why pay anything?The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court battles.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Will cars need new number plates?If there is a no-deal Brexit, drivers may need a GB sticker if they are travelling to an EU member state, even if their car has a Euro-plate (a number plate displaying both the EU flag and a GB sign).You will not need a GB sticker to drive outside the UK if you replace a Euro-plate with a number plate that features the GB sign without the EU flag, the Department of Transport says.THE ECONOMY What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 but slowed to 1.4% in 2018, the slowest rate since 2012.Inflation rose after June 2016, reaching a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017.However it has since eased, to stand at 1.8%.Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 4%.Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 1.7% in the year to January 2019, according to official ONS figures.Read More: How has business been affected by Brexit?What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive.The UK inflation figure for the year to December 2018 was 2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA The average price for property continued to increase after June 2016's EU referendum, although the annual growth rate slowed from 8.2% in the year to June 2016 to 1.7% in the year to January 2019, according to official ONS figures.However the exact extent to which this is solely due to Brexit is hard to determine.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018.Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock There will be no immediate return of duty-free sales if the UK leaves the EU with a version of Theresa May's deal.That's because existing customs rules will continue to apply for the planned 21-month transition period.The possible return of duty-free could be part of negotiations on a future trade deal after December 2020.If the UK leaves without a deal, duty-free sales could return.LEGAL MATTERS Will leaving the EU mean the UK doesn't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the European Court of Human Rights, not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after Brexit After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit.JARGON BUSTER Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hard Brexit.Soft Brexit.No Deal.What does Brexit mean?What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it.What is Article 50?Image copyright Thinkstock Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so.It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs THE POLITICAL SITUATION What changed in government after the 2016 referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.How did the snap 2017 election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright PA Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the "least damaging" option for the UK economy as a whole - and has thrown her weight behind the campaign for another EU referendum.BREXIT NEGOTIATIONS They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits.Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border.A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December, 2017: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks.They then agreed terms for the "transition" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Who has been negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, was foreign secretary.These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU.However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan.Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary.Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting heavily involved in the Brussels talks.Senior civil servant Olly Robbins has been the top EU official at the Brexit talks in Brussels.He started out at the top official at the Brexit department but was moved to the Cabinet Office to work directly for Theresa May, as the PM took more control over the process.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the referendum campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 12.1m, including two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to remain : The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Britain Stronger in Europe raised 12.1m, including two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.: The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Vote Leave -

you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving?The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list.Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out.Only France and Germany contribute more.In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill.That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, depend on whether the UK leaves with a deal or not.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.If the UK leaves with a deal, this will not change.If there's no deal, pet passports issued in the UK would not be valid for travel to the EU.Pet owners planning to travel with their animals, would need to get them microchipped and vaccinated against rabies.Further details are on the government website.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it would shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of "home grown" doctors qualifying through new medical schools.But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting.Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a "Brexit dividend" was helping fund a larger-than-planned 20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.Adrian runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU.Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%.Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a "free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.Image copyright Thinkstock What impact will leaving have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.Image copyright Getty Images How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.After Brexit, there will be two possibilities.If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals with a British state pension Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, an Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.
