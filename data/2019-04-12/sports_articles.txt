Tkachuk, Smith lift Flames over Avalanche 4-0 in Game 1:::::The buzz in the crowd started when Mike Smith came up big with some slick saves during the second period.The chants of "Smitty!Smitty!Smitty!"continued throughout the rest of the game until the veteran goaltender and the Calgary Flames finished off an impressive playoff victory."I haven't quite heard anything like that before in my career," Smith said."It gives you some confidence when you hear your name getting chanted."Now is as good a time as any for Smith, who made 26 saves for his first playoff shutout in nearly seven years as the Flames blanked the Colorado Avalanche 4-0 on Thursday night in Game 1 of their first-round Western Conference playoff series.A key sequence came early in the second period when the Avalanche went to the power play for the third consecutive time.With all the momentum with Colorado, the 37-year-old Smith made two glove stops 30 seconds apart to keep the game scoreless.First, he made a backhand snag off the stick of Gabriel Landeskog, who was left alone in front.Then, with a little extra flourish afterward, Smith threw out his glove to snag Derrick Brassard's dangerous snap shot.From that point through the end of the game, chants of "Smitty!"broke out regularly from the raucous, sold-out, red jersey-clad crowd.The shutout was Smith's first in the postseason since May 20, 2012, when he made 36 stops while with the Phoenix Coyotes to shut out the Los Angeles Kings in Game 4 of the Western Conference final.The Coyotes lost the next game and Smith hadn't played a playoff game since."Great to see the fans really get behind him," Flames captain Mark Giordano said."He's a big part of our team.He works his butt off in practice all the time.Can't be happier for him."Matthew Tkachuk scored twice, and rookie Andrew Mangiapane and Mikael Backlund also had goals as Calgary won its first playoff game since beating Anaheim 4-3 in overtime on May 5, 2015.And, Smith was a big reason the Flames and their fans went home happy."Our killers did an unbelievable job to kill off all those penalties," Smith said."I was able to make a couple big saves there in the second, then we go down the ice and (Mangiapane) scores a big goal for us, so obviously that's a big momentum swing in the game."It was a bit of a change for Smith, who wasn't exactly a fan favorite while struggling at times at home with an .889 save percentage."It felt a lot better than the other," Smith quipped, when asked how these chants felt.It took until 14:25 of the second period for the game's first goal but Mangiapane's unassisted score was a highlight-reel effort.The sequence began with Garnet Hathaway's heavy hit on Erik Johnson on the side boards.Mangiapane collected the loose puck and took it to the net where he weaved around Nikita Zadorov and carried the puck across the top of the crease before sending a backhander from his knees past a sprawling Philipp Grubauer.Hathaway also had an indirect hand in the Flames' second goal later in the second as he was hauled down while sending a shot off the crossbar to draw a penalty.Calgary converted on the power play at 18:58 to take a 2-0 lead to the second intermission.On the goal, Mark Giordano's point shot was deflected out of the air by Tkachuk.Called a goal on the ice, Avalanche coach Jared Bednar challenged it, suggesting it was deflected by a high stick, but the goal stood after a lengthy review.Backlund made it 2 for 4 for Calgary with the extra man when his goal at 17:01 of the third made it 3-0.Tkachuk sealed it 14 seconds later with an empty-netter off an assist from Smith."The majority of this game I liked the way we played.I liked the speed we played with," Landeskog said."But at the same time, I'd like to get something in front of Smith and take away his eyes.He's a big goalie.He makes the saves he needs to.I'd like to test him a little bit more."NOTES: Grubauer made 28 stops for Colorado....The Flames finished the regular season on a 1-for-38 skid on the man advantage over the final 13 games.... Calgary opened up the playoffs at home for the first time since 2006....It was the first playoff game as a head coach for Bill Peters, who failed to make the postseason in his four seasons with Carolina.UP NEXT Game 2 is Saturday night in Calgary.
Capitals survive surge from Hurricanes to win Game 1:::::Nicklas Backstrom and Alex Ovechkin came out firing, the Carolina Hurricanes surged and the Washington Capitals showed why they're the defending Stanley Cup champions when it mattered most.Backstrom and Ovechkin combined to score three goals on the first eight shots before 19-year-old rookie Andrei Svechnikov led a furious third-period comeback.But Backstrom blocked a couple of shots in the final minutes, Braden Holtby made 27 saves and Washington held on to beat Carolina 4-2 on Thursday night in Game 1 of their first-round series."We didn't panic," Backstrom said after his third career two-goal game in the playoffs."We stuck with it."One night after watching the Presidents' Trophy-winning Tampa Bay Lightning blow a three-goal lead and lose 4-3 to the Columbus Blue Jackets, the Capitals went up 3-0 at 18:05 of the first period and had the sellout crowd decked out in red fired up for the first playoff game in Washington since the franchise won its first title in June.The Hurricanes took it to the Capitals, outshooting them 29-18 and got two goals in 2:19 from Svechnikov early in the third period to cut the deficit to one.The Capitals, who led Columbus 2-0 in each of the first two games of last year's playoffs before losing 4-3 and 5-4, had those experiences and the Lightning's loss on Wednesday fresh in their minds."We knew it's not over, even 15-nothing," Ovechkin said."You can see what happened last night in a different game.It's the playoffs and you never know what's going to happen."Another three-goal comeback almost happened in this one.Well after the "Back-to-back!"chants faded into nervous silence, Hurricanes goaltender Petr Mrazek rebounded from allowing a soft opening goal to Backstrom by stopping Nic Dowd and Carl Hagelin on breakaways and turned aside Brett Connolly and Lars Eller on rapid-fire chances early in the third before Svechnikov got the Hurricanes on the board.Mrazek finished with 14 saves.Svechnikov became the youngest player to score two-plus goals in a playoff game since Dainius Zubrus in 1997, but the Hurricanes failed to score on two late power plays and Eller sealed it with an empty-net goal with 36.6 seconds left.Despite the loss, the young Hurricanes go into Game 2 Saturday knowing they can go toe-to-toe with the playoff-seasoned Capitals."We're here.We can play with them," defenseman Jaccob Slavin said."One of the biggest positives is that we've got a group in here that can play.Obviously they're the defending champs, they're a good team and they won last year for a reason and they know how to do it on that side.But I thought we stuck with them."Carolina, which had 10 players making their playoff debuts after ending the NHL's longest postseason drought, didn't go away.In the Hurricanes' first playoff game since 2009, they showed a lot of the fight that allowed them to climb the standings and get in after some early-season scoring struggles."They're aggressive all over the ice and didn't give us a lot of time out there, but I think as a team we can play a little bit better," Backstrom said."We got lucky there."It's not just luck.After allowing two goals to Svechnikov he believes he should have stopped, Holtby was there to backstop the penalty kill after a hooking call on Jakub Vrana and a high-sticking call on T.J. Oshie threatened to push the game into overtime.Backstrom who beat Mrazek on a harmless-looking shot to open the scoring and tapped the puck in on a backdoor play on the power play was arguably at his most important when he got his body in front of a couple of shots in the third to keep Washington ahead."It's one of the main things that won the Stanley Cup for us," Holtby said."The guys didn't hesitate to get right back into doing those things.It's great to see."NOTES: Capitals D John Carlson tied an NHL playoff record with three assists in one period.... With his 62nd career playoff goal, Ovechkin tied Bobby Hull for 27th on the all-time list.... Backstrom picked up his 100th career playoff point.... Carolina All-Star C Sebastian Aho was held without a goal for a 15th consecutive game.... D Calvin de Haan missed his fourth in a row with an upper-body injury.Coach Rod Brind'Amour said de Haan skated, but had no timetable for his return....The Capitals signed C Nic Dowd to a $2.25 million, three-year extension....The Capitals recalled top prospect Ilya Samsonov to be their third goaltender for at least the first two games of the series.UP NEXT The Capitals host Game 2 Saturday afternoon looking to take a 2-0 lead in a series for just the third time in the past five playoffs.
Marner has 2 goals, including penalty shot, Leafs top Bruins:::::The Toronto Maple Leafs know they can't count on short-handed penalty shots to help them get past Boston in the playoffs.The hustle that forced the Bruins to make mistakes, though: That's something they are planning to do over and over again."It's a weird play, but we'll take all goals," defenseman Jake Muzzin said on Thursday night after Mitch Marner converted Toronto's first successful postseason penalty shot in two decades to propel the Leafs to a 4-1 victory over Boston."You pressure them, and you can force turnovers and fumbled pucks," Muzzin said after Toronto took Game 1 of the first-round playoff series."And away you go."Marner scored twice the first to erase a first-period deficit, and the second to give the Leafs the lead for good after he was brought down from behind by Jake DeBrusk on a short-handed breakaway.It was Toronto's first successful postseason penalty shot since Mats Sundin converted in 1999."When you get a power play, you want to get something good out of it and get some momentum," said Bruins forward Patrice Bergeron, who scored Boston's only goal."Obviously, that did the opposite.... That can't happen."Frederik Andersen made 37 saves and William Nylander also scored on a breakaway for Toronto, which swiped the home-ice advantage in the best-of-seven series as it tries to advance through Boston for the first time in six tries.Game 2 is Saturday night."It's one game, but it gets us a step closer to where we want to get to," said John Tavares, who added an empty-netter to clinch it."It's always good to start that way."Tuukka Rask stopped 29 shots for Boston, and Bergeron scored a power-play goal midway through the first on a pass from Brad Marchand.But Marner tied it with about three minutes left in the period, sweeping in a rebound with such force he knocked himself off his skates.Then, about three minutes into the second with Boston on a power play, Marner flipped the puck ahead toward center ice and chased it down with a clear path to the goal.When he was just outside the crease, DeBrusk was called for bringing him down from behind, and he went crashing into Rask.DeBrusk crashed hard into the boards and appeared to go to the locker room for attention, but returned to the game.Marner lined up for the penalty shot, came at Rask from the left side and then slid over to the right faster than the goalie could follow.He pushed the puck into the open net to make it 2-1."I put my whole weight on my right foot, and then I just couldn't get there anymore," Rask said."It was a nice move."Nazem Kadri sent Nylander off on a breakaway to make it 3-1 with 95 seconds left in the period.Rask came up with a pair of saves in the final minute to keep things from getting out of control, stopping Tavares on a breakaway with 38 seconds left and then a 3-on-1 at the horn."We know we're a fast team in this locker room," Marner said."I think we know when we play right, it's hard to stop us."Boston pulled Rask with 2:35 left, but Tavares scored off a center-ice faceoff with 79 seconds left.NOTES: The Leafs have only been awarded four postseason penalty shots, and the only other time they have scored was Sundin against Buffalo on May 29, 1999....The Bruins have given up six postseason penalty shots, just two of them successful.The last attempt was by Philadelphia's Ville Leino in 2010....The Bruins outshot Toronto 21-14 in the second period, but gave up two goals.... Muzzin, a trade deadline acquisition who missed the final regular-season game with an illness, assisted on Marner's first goal.UP NEXT Game 2 is Saturday night in Boston before the series moves to Toronto for Games 3 and 4 on Monday and Wednesday.

Masters Tournament: Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau share 18-hole lead at Augusta:::::No need to wait until Sunday for the Masters to come to life.Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau and Phil Mickelson delivered enough excitement over the final two hours Thursday for quite an opening act at Augusta National.Koepka, a winner in two of the last three majors, ran off four straight birdies in the middle of the back nine by overpowering a soft course.DeChambeau came within inches of two hole-outs over the last three holes as he closed with four straight birdies.They each had a 6-under 66, giving them a one-shot lead over the 49-year-old Mickelson, who provided his own brand of entertainment.Mickelson began the back nine with shots into the pine trees and the water, only to follow with four birdies over the next five holes, including a tee shot on the par-3 16th that stopped inches from the cup.Tiger Woods missed all the action.He played earlier in the round and plodded his way to a 70.It was a solid start for Woods in his quest to end 11 years without a major, and he was atop the leaderboard briefly until a late bogey.He sounded satisfied."I've shot this number and won four coats, so hopefully, I can do it again," said Woods, who slightly miscalculated.The last green jacket he won in 2005 began with a 74.The goal was to not fall too far behind early.Rory McIlroy's bid for the last leg of the career Grand Slam began with a 73, which featured six bogeys."I made five birdies -- that wasn't the problem," McIlroy said."I just made too many mistakes, and that was the problem."Even more surprising to McIlroy was no one from the early starters took advantage of soft turf from recent rains."It's there for the taking, and I'm surprised someone hasn't run off," McIlroy said.And that's right about when Koepka and DeChambeau took off.More impressive than the four straight birdies by DeChambeau was how he made them.After a two-putt birdie on the par-5 15th, his tee shot grazed the edge of the cup in the front left portion of the green.From the woods, he went just over the back of the 17th green and chipped in from 35 feet.He didn't see until later how good his shot was into the 18th because he was in light rough short of the fairway bunker, unable to see the green but knowing it was good from the roar of the crowd.The ball ran true to the cup and smacked into the middle of the pin with enough force to knock it backward a few inches."I guess I should have pulled the flagstick," DeChambeau said.He is not the only player to putt with the flagstick in the cup -- allowed under the new Rules of Golf -- just the only one to apply science to the decision.Koepka shot his 66 while playing in the last group of the day, and not seeing very good golf alongside him.Jordan Spieth had to rely on his short game to salvage a 75, matching his highest score at Augusta.Paul Casey, coming off a victory three weeks ago in Florida, failed to make a birdie in his round of 81.Blinders on, Koepka played bogey-free in his first time at the Masters in two years.He missed last year recovering from a wrist injury that left him wondering if he would ever play again.Then he won a second straight U.S. Open, held off Woods to win the PGA Championship and has established himself as a major player.He holed out from behind the green at No.12, picked up birdies on the par 5s and rolled in a bending 20-footer in between on the 14th.Dustin Johnson and Ian Poulter were at 68, while Jon Rahm and Adam Scott were among those at 69.Justin Rose, who returned to No.1 in the world and was among the favorites this week because of his recent history at the Masters, opened with a 75."It's just a great test of golf to start out the first round of Masters," DeChambeau said."And to be honest, it's great to sift through some of the really good players and maybe not so great players in this event right now.And look, it's not to say they are bad players.It's just it's very difficult out there and every aspect of your game has to be on point.So it's kind of nice, you can almost break away from the pack if you play well."

Pavelski's painful goal leads Sharks past Golden Knights 5-2:::::Joe Pavelski lost a couple of teeth, had stitches in his lip and his mouth was still bloody long after taking Brent Burns' point shot right off his chin .Pavelski was also able to smile since his pain led to a goal and a playoff victory.Pavelski's first-period goal and then his return to the ice in the second period despite the injury inspired his teammates, who delivered their most complete game in weeks with a 5-2 victory Wednesday night over the Vegas Golden Knights in Game 1 of their first-round series."Tough as nails," coach Peter DeBoer said of his captain."To take a puck to the face like that, didn't go down.Only missed maybe a shift at the end of the period and played the rest of the game.There's no other word for it.He's a warrior."Burns, Marc-Edouard Vlasic and Evander Kane added goals in a wild second period that featured heavy hitting, a parade to the penalty box and the high intensity expected in a series between two franchises that have become fierce rivals in just two seasons.Tomas Hertl added an empty-net goal and Martin Jones made 24 saves to get San Jose started off right in this series heading into Game 2 on Friday night.Mark Stone scored both goals for the Golden Knights, who struggled to generate much offense at all against a Sharks team that has appeared to shake off a late-season slide in time for the postseason.Marc-Andre Fleury made 28 saves."They outplayed us on every facet of the game tonight," coach Gerard Gallant said."They worked harder and competed harder.We weren't good enough.They didn't do anything different than what we expected but they played a lot harder.Our guys have to be ready to play more competitive hockey in the next game."Pavelski epitomized that with the Sharks on the power play in the first period.He went to the front of the net, where he is usually so adept at tipping pucks with his stick for goals.Burns' point shot came in high and hit him in the chin instead before bouncing into the net.Pavelski was unable even to celebrate, heading straight to the dressing room for treatment while the crowd roared at the series-opening goal."It's nice to hear the fans cheer," Pavelski said."Silver lining sort of thing, should I go to the pile or not?I knew everything was messed up there for a little bit, but I think somewhat fortunate it wasn't worse."There was concern in the arena when Pavelski didn't come out to start the second, but he re-emerged early in the period with a bloody mouth and a full shield to protect his injured face.Things then got wild early in the period following a series of penalties.After coincidental minors to San Jose's Brenden Dillon and Jonathan Marchessault left the teams playing 4-on-4, the Sharks went on a power play when Deryk Engelland was called for a trip.That was quickly negated when Pavelski was called for tripping, creating the rare 3-on-3 in the playoffs.The Sharks capitalized when Erik Karlsson fed Burns, who beat Fleury from the top of the circle with a wrister to make it 2-0.Then with the teams back at 4-on-4 less than a minute later, Joe Thornton set up Vlasic in the slot for the goal that made it 3-0.The Golden Knights got on the board seconds after Pavelski's penalty ended when Stone got inside of Burns at the side of the net to knock in a loose puck.But the Sharks regained the three-goal lead with 17.1 seconds remaining in the period when Kane deftly deflected a perfect pass from Karlsson at the point past Fleury.Stone scored late in the third on a power play to make it 4-2.But Jones stopped Reilly Smith on a breakaway with less than three minutes left and Hertl sealed it with his empty-netter."We were undisciplined tonight," Marchessault said."That's how we lost the game.This whole series revolves around our discipline and our work ethic.Jones is already a great goalie, but tonight we made his night little easier than expected."NOTES: The Golden Knights had scored in the first five minutes in eight of 14 meetings between the teams, including all four this season.But Vegas didn't even have a shot on goal for the first five minutes this game.... Karlsson had two assists in his second game back after missing 17 games with a groin injury.UP NEXT Game 2 is Friday night in San Jose.
Rookie scores twice, Stars beat Preds for 1-0 series lead:::::Miro Heiskanen turned in a postseason debut to remember with the Dallas rookie defenseman writing himself into the NHL's record book.Heiskanen scored two goals, helping the Stars beat the Nashville Predators 3-2 on Wednesday night in Game 1 of their first-round Western Conference series.He became the third teenage defenseman in NHL history with two goals in a playoff game, joining Phil Housley and Glen Wesley.He also became the eighth rookie teenage defenseman in NHL history and fifth-youngest with a goal in their first career playoff game, and first since Adam Larsson with New Jersey on May 1, 2012, against Philadelphia, according to NHL Stats.Heiskanen also became the youngest in franchise history with a postseason goal at 19 years, 266 days.He said he was trying to treat the game like any other."It went in," Heiskanen said of his goals."I think Rads (Alexander Radulov) tipped the other one and was great goals and yeah, I just try to shoot it, shoot at the net."First-year Dallas coach Jim Montgomery has run out of words to praise the rookie."Just like I've said all year, I'm glad we have him," Montgomery said.Mats Zuccarello also scored, helping Dallas continue its success from the regular season in Nashville, where the Stars won twice.Roman Josi and P.K.Subban each scored for Nashville.Game 2 of the best-of-seven series is Saturday night in Nashville.Subban pulled the Predators within a goal with 6:36 left in regulation, beating Ben Bishop's glove with a wrister from the right circle.Nashville got a power play with 4:52 remaining, and coach Peter Laviolette pulled goalie Pekka Rinne with 3:13 left.The Predators couldn't force overtime."We lost our way, we lost the game," Laviolette said."There's nothing encouraging about tonight.We know we're capable of playing at high speed with high gears and competitiveness.Like I said, it went their way."The Predators came in with much more playoff experience after reaching the 2017 Stanley Cup Final and going a full seven games last spring before losing in the second round.The postseason party started as usual with at least one catfish tossed onto the ice and fans who couldn't get into the sold-out Bridgestone Arena watching outside at the park across the street.This is the first time these Central Division rivals have met in the postseason, timely with Nashville scheduled to play Dallas in the Winter Classic in the Cotton Bowl next season.The Predators came into the playoffs having won five of their last six to win their second straight division title with a win on the final night of the season.Dallas finished 5-1-1 to grab the first wild card in the West for the Stars' first playoff berth since 2016.The Stars went with Bishop after he posted a career-high seven shutouts during the regular season.He also led the NHL with a .934 save percentage and was second in the league with a 1.98 goals-against average.He made 30 saves for this win."Let's not forget how good Bishop was," Montgomery said."I mean that first period, they controlled every part of the game except for the one power play we had, and Bishop kept us in.It could've been 4-nothing."Josi gave the Predators a 1-0 lead with a backhander from the slot as he skated across at 12:12 of the first.Nashville forward Brian Boyle, acquired from New Jersey in a trade Feb. 6, sent Stars center Jason Dickinson to the locker room after a collision about 9 minutes into the first.Dickinson returned in the second.Heiskanen tied it at 12:37 of the second with the puck deflecting off the knee of Predators defenseman Mattias Ekholm.Dallas nearly took the lead off a shot by Roope Hintz with Dickinson following, only to see Rinne stop the puck on the line with the back of his skate 15:00 into the second.The rookie defenseman scored his second at 6:10 of the third with a similar long shot that beat Rinne with Radulov in front of the goalie."What a game," Dallas captain Jamie Benn said of Heiskanen."The kid comes to play every night, prepares like a true professional, approaches the game like a true professional.He played a pretty damn good game tonight."Zuccarello padded the lead off a rebound, beating Rinne between the legs at 10:39."This series started, and we got to make sure we are ready for the Game 2," Rinne said.NOTES: Housley scored twice in Game 6 in a divisional final in 1983, and Wesley had two in the suspended Game 4 of the 1988 Stanley Cup Final, as teenage defensemen scoring twice in a playoff game.... Heiskanen set a franchise record with 33 points by a teenage defenseman.He also was one of only three Stars to play all 82 games this season.... Radek Faska was the last Stars rookie to score a goal in his playoff debut on April 14, 2016, against Minnesota, and Curt Giles was the last Dallas rookie defenseman with a goal in his postseason debut on April 8, 1980, against Toronto....The Predators went 35-4-1 this season when scoring first and had been 24-7 all-time when scoring first in the playoffs.UP NEXT Game 2 in Nashville on Saturday night.
Bozak's late goal lifts Blues over Jets 2-1 in Game 1:::::Pat Maroon set up the winning goal for the St. Louis Blues, and his thoughts immediately turned to his late grandfather.Tyler Bozak scored with 2:05 left in the third period off Maroon's assist to give the Blues a 2-1 victory over the Winnipeg Jets on Wednesday night in Game 1 of their Western Conference opening-round playoff series."He was watching above," Maroon said of his grandfather, who died Tuesday at 95 years old."So, obviously, that was for him."Maroon sent a backhand pass from behind the net out to Bozak in the slot, and Bozak's quick shot went by Winnipeg's Connor Hellebuyck for the go-ahead goal."It's been emotional, tough days for me," said Maroon, who posted a tribute to his grandfather on Twitter."But being with the guys and having them by my side has been really good."David Perron also scored for St. Louis early in the third, and Jordan Binnington made 24 saves."I had a lot of chances tonight, so I knew the puck was kind of following me around a bit," Bozak said."It's always fun when that happens, so after the few I missed it was definitely nice to get one in there."Patrik Laine scored late in the first period and Hellebuyck stopped 24 shots for the Jets, who host Game 2 on Friday."Real tight, and that's what we expect," Jets captain Blake Wheeler said of the game."We expect it's going to go seven, and seven real close games.It didn't go our way tonight."The goalies played a big role in keeping the game tight, even though Binnington took an early tumble to the ice.Winnipeg's Mark Scheifele was sent to the penalty box 34 seconds into the first period for interference.As he was skating to the back of the St. Louis net, he banged into Binnington, who was behind the net and returning to his crease.Blues forward Brayden Schenn shoved Scheifele hard in retaliation, but only drew boos from fans and not a penalty."It's playoff hockey," Binnington said."I can take a hit."Laine sent a blast from the high slot past Binnington at 13:38.The Finnish forward only had one goal in his last 19 games of the regular season."We've had a couple of those where they score the winning goal in the last two minutes," Laine said."So it's always tough, but that's how it goes sometimes.We still had two minutes to tie the game, but couldn't do it.We've got to focus on the next game."St. Louis outshot the Jets 8-7 in the opening frame, with Laine having two shots.On the eve of the series, Laine said his confidence wasn't high and he planned to shoot every puck he could at Binnington to try to make the rookie nervous.The 20-year-old also said the Jets "have better players in this locker room than they have" and when they're on their game "we're just a better team."Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien helped divert a St. Louis goal early in the second period.Vladimir Tarasenko fired a shot at Hellebuyck and the puck trickled out from under him toward the goal line, but Byfuglien swooped in and slapped it out of the crease.Winnipeg's penalty kill worked twice more in the second period.Binnington then came up big on a backhand breakaway shot by Par Lindholm and a quick shot from Andrew Copp.The Jets got their first power play of the game with 3:09 left in the middle frame.Byfuglien had his team's two shots with the man advantage one was stopped and the other hit the post.Laine rang a shot off the post just over one minute into the third, followed by Perron's point shot through traffic that went by Hellebuyck to tie it up at 4:05.The Winnipeg netminder blocked a Bozak shot late in the period and then couldn't stop the winner.Hellebuyck was pulled right away for the extra attacker, but Binnington slid across his crease to make an impressive pad save on Scheifele's one-timer with under 12.4 seconds left."The mindset was just compete to the end and give the team a chance to win," Binnington said."That buzzer couldn't have come sooner."NOTES: Winnipeg (47-30-5) and St. Louis (45-28-9) tied for second in the Central Division with 99 points.The Jets earned home-ice advantage with three more combined regulation/overtime victories than the Blues.... Last season, the Jets soared into the playoffs on a 9-1 run and made it to the Western Conference final, losing to Vegas in five games.The Blues missed the playoffs.UP NEXT Game 2 of the series is Friday night in Winnipeg.
Bailey lifts Islanders past Penguins 4-3 in OT in Game 1:::::Josh Bailey didn't have much time to think when he saw the puck on the side of the crease after Mathew Barzal's try hit the left goalpost in overtime.Bailey just swooped in and knocked it into the net to send the New York Islanders home with a win.Bailey scored at 4:39 of the extra period and the Islanders beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 4-3 on Wednesday night in the opener of their Eastern Conference first-round playoff series."It just happened so quick," Bailey said."I wasn't sure.It didn't lay very flat for me.I was just trying to whack it and hope it went in.... A crucial game.There's still a long way to go, but a good win for us."Barzal had brought the puck into the offensive zone on a 2-on-1 break, faked in front to draw Matt Murray out and sent the backhand shot that bounced off the left post.He was initially upset with himself at missing the opportunity before he saw Bailey come up and put it in."I see the puck laying there and I was just obviously (angry), I thought the chance had ended," Barzal said."And I see Bails come in and swoop in and bury it.I was obviously super happy to see that.Awesome for him.First game and that's nice for the confidence."Jordan Eberle had a goal and an assist, and Brock Nelson and Nick Leddy also scored for New York, which was opening a postseason series at home for the first time in 31 years.Robin Lehner stopped 41 shots.Game 2 is Friday night back at the Nassau Coliseum.Phil Kessel and Evgeni Malkin each had a goal and an assist, and Justin Schultz also scored for the Penguins.Murray finished with 29 saves."It was a hard-fought game," Pittsburgh coach Mike Sullivan said."It wasn't perfect out there by any stretch, but I thought we played hard."Tom Kuhnhackl, who had a goal in the opening minute of the game waved off for offside, nearly won it for the Islanders 1:12 into the extra period as he crashed into Murray and the puck crossed the goal line but not before the net came loose.The no-goal was confirmed after a review.The Islanders led three times in regulation with the Penguins managing to tie it each time."We just stayed to it," Islanders coach Barry Trotz said."I liked our composure on the bench.There were a lot of twists and turns to that game.... (We) didn't flinch at all."Leddy gave the Islanders a 3-2 lead with 7:25 left in the third as he sent a long shot from left point at the blue line that knuckled past Murray.With Murray pulled for an extra skater, Schultz fired a one-timer from the left circle inside the left post with 1:29 left.Bailey had a chance at the winner for the Islanders in the closing seconds, but his shot hit the right post.He was glad it didn't end up being a costly miss."I was afraid I was going to have to see that in my nightmares for a while," Bailey said."Yeah, a little bit of redemption.Just happy to get the win."Malkin tied it 2-2 on a power play with 6:19 left in the middle period as his shot from the inside edge of the right circle deflected off Islander defenseman Adam Pelech's stick and up past Lehner.The raucous crowd that was chanting "Let's Go Islanders!"from before the teams came out for pregame warmups, roared when the Islanders stepped on the ice and booed loudly when the Penguins followed.They got loud again in the minutes before the teams emerged from their dressing rooms for the start of the game.Pittsburgh outshot New York 17-12 in the first period, but the Islanders led 2-1 after 20 minutes.Just more than a minute after Kuhnhackl's opening-minute goal was overturned, Eberle did give the Islanders the lead as he stopped a deflection of Pelech's shot, turned and beat Murray through the five-hole from the right side for his first career postseason goal at 1:40.The Penguins tied it when Dominik Simon brought the puck down the middle and dropped a pass back to Kessel, who put it past Lehner off the post and in at 5:42.Nelson put the Islanders back in front on the power play as he got a pass in front from Eberle and put it past Murray with 4:14 left in the opening period.NOTES: Malkin, Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang are the only Penguins players remaining from the 2013 playoff series against the Islanders.New York has five players left Nelson, Josh Bailey, Casey Cizikas, Thomas Hickey and Matt Martin.... Kessel also scored in each of the last three games during the regular season.... Malkin's goal was his 63rd in the playoffs, breaking a tie with Bobby Hull for sole possession of 26th place on the NHL's career list.UP NEXT Game 2 is Friday night before the series shifts to Pittsburgh for Games 3 and 4.
Blue Jackets rally from 3-goal deficit to beat Lightning 4-3:::::The Columbus Blue Jackets rebounded from a dismal start to stun the team that had the NHL's best regular-season record.Seth Jones scored the go-ahead goal on the power play to cap Columbus' three-goal third period, and the Blue Jackets rallied to beat the Tampa Bay Lightning 4-3 in Game 1 of the teams' first-round Eastern Conference playoff series Wednesday night."We can't get comfortable," Jones said."Nothing is going to get easier.It's only going to get harder."Jones made it 4-3 from the slot with 5:55 to play as the Blues Jackets erased a 3-0 deficit after the Lightning scored three times in the opening period.With Columbus trailing 3-1 in the third, David Savard deked around Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman and scored 7:56 into the period to make it a one-goal game.Josh Anderson picked up a short-handed goal that tied it at 3 at 11:54.The Blue Jackets became the 27th NHL team to overcome at least a three-goal deficit to win a playoff game in regulation.Nick Foligno had the other goal for Columbus, and Sergei Bobrovsky ended up with 26 saves after struggling in the first period.The Lightning, who matched the 1995-96 Detroit Red Wings for the most wins in a regular season with 62, got first-period goals from Alex Killorn, Anthony Cirelli and Yanni Gourde.Andrei Vasilevskiy stopped 22 shots."Our mentality was, we wanted to outscore them tonight instead of build a lead and then shut then down," Lightning coach Jon Cooper said."Our mentality has to be when we get in these situations is shut teams down, not to add to the lead."Tampa Bay scored 325 goals in 2018-19, the most by any team in 23 years.Hedman returned after missing the final four regular-season game with an upper-body injury.The Norris Trophy winner took a helmet to the face during a collision with Washington's Carl Hagelin on March 30.Killorn stole the puck from Jones at the blue line during a power play for Columbus and put a backhander past Bobrovsky to open the scoring 4:12 into the game.Tampa Bay was tied for third in short-handed goals during the regular season with 12.After Cirelli had a rebound goal at 11:01, Gourde's waist-high deflection of Mikhail Sergachev's shot made it 3-0 with 2:10 left in the first."We're just losing too many battles," Blue Jackets coach John Tortorella said of his first-intermission message."Just the grind of the game.We have to be able to grind with them."Foligno cut the deficit to 3-1 at 9:15 of the second on a breakaway goal after Tampa Bay's Ryan McDonagh made an errant pass in the offensive zone.Alexandre Texier, Columbus' 19-year-old rookie who played in the Blue Jackets' final two regular-season games, skated in alone on Vasilevskiy but missed the net on a shot with 4 minutes to go in the first.Bobrovsky stopped four shots over the final 40 seconds of the second, including a nifty glove save on Steven Stamkos."We don't have a chance if he doesn't play the way he played through the second and the third," Tortorella said of Bobrovsky.Nikita Kucherov, who had an NHL-best 128 points in the regular season, was held without a point but had an in-close chance turned aside by Bobrovsky and hit the crossbar during the opening minute of the second during a power play."I don't know if it's a wake-up call, but we know it's a tough league to win in and we want to be better when we're up 3-0," Hedman said.NOTES: Tampa Bay outscored Columbus 17-3 in sweeping all three games between the teams in the regular season....Lightning D Anton Stralman sat out with a lower-body injury, but might return during the series.... RW Ryan Callahan and D Braydon Coburn were among Tampa Bay's healthy scratches.... Columbus D Adam McQuaid (upper-body injury) didn't play.QUOTABLE "You can go through all the numbers, all the things, them against us, but when you play a 60-minute hockey game and you go through the momentum swings and the surges and maybe the big plays out of someone unexpected or a lousy play from someone unexpected, that changes games.So, that's why it's always up for grabs."Tortorella before the game on the unpredictability of playoff hockey.UP NEXT The Lightning will host Game 2 on Friday night.
Brooks, Bryson, Phil and what could be a wild Day 2 at the Masters:::::AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Brains and brawn share the top spot on the leaderboard heading into the second round of the 83rd Masters at Augusta National Golf Club.Bryson DeChambeau, with a physics degree from Southern Methodist University, fired an opening-round 66, with nine birdies and three bogeys.Brooks Koepka, who is known to spend as much time in the gym as on the practice green, posted the same 6-under score with a flawless bogey-free round.DeChambeau birdied six of the last seven holes; Koepka had five birdies on the back nine.The 25-year-old DeChambeau is No.6 in the Official World Golf Rankings; 28-year-old Koepka is No.4.So they head into Friday with it being the first time two top-six players in their 20s share the lead after any round in a major.play 1:42 Koepka credits preparation for strong first round Brooks Koepka explains the preparation that went into The Masters, and how he can continue to perform well.DeChambeau nearly aced the par-3 16th hole, which would have been the first of his career, and he hit the pin with his second shot on 18, before settling for a tap-in birdie to close his round."I was just looking to shoot something in the 60s because I'd never done that here before," DeChambeau said."What a magical back nine.The wind started to pick up around Amen Corner, and it was tough.It was not easy one bit."It was easier for DeChambeau than most.Affectionately known as the "Mad Scientist" for his analytical approach to the game, DeChambeau plays with single-length irons -- each one is 37 inches long, about the length of a 7-iron -- with club heads that each weigh 278 grams.Thanks to new PGA Tour rules, DeChambeau played his first round at Augusta National by putting with the flagsticks in.Apparently, he liked the flagsticks' COR (coefficient of restitution), whatever that is.Last week, DeChambeau spent 14 hours working on a gear system at Dallas National Golf Club, attempting to get on the right side of the spin loft curve with his wedges."If I get driven enough to where it's been a long enough time to where we haven't figured something out, I will exhaust every resource until I figure it out," DeChambeau said."And that's common with me.I become almost a little, in a positive way, OCD about trying to complete something, very positive way."Koepka, who has won the past two U.S. Open titles as well as the 2018 PGA Championship, came into the week facing questions about his dramatic weight loss.Koepka didn't play well earlier this season, missing the cut at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, finishing in a tie for 56th at the Players Championship and failing to get out of group play at the WGC-Dell Technologies Match Play.Koepka admitted his weight loss cost him yardage off the tee, and he said earlier this week that he was on a diet of about 1,800 calories per day.He said he had bloodwork and other medical testing done to figure out what was going on."I mean, you're not going to be in the best physical shape at that point," Koepka said."You look at somebody like Michael Phelps or somebody like that eating 6,000 or 7,000 calories by lunch time.But I wanted to do it and try to lose some weight, and maybe went about it a little too aggressively for just a long period of time and the intensity of what I was doing."Koepka said his plan was to be physically ready for the Masters, and there was no sign of fatigue on Thursday.He said he's also avoiding the gym, which feels kind of "weird.""I lift all the time," he said."I lift too many weights, and I'm too big to play golf.And then when I lose weight, I'm too small.So, I don't know.I don't know what to say.I'm too big and I'm too small."Listen, I'm going to make me happy.I don't care what anybody else says.I'm doing it for me, and obviously it seems to work."Can Phil keep the old magic going?Phil Mickelson, who is attempting to become the oldest major champion at more than 48 years, enjoyed a drama-free 2-under 34 on the front nine.But after he made the turn, things took a dramatic turn for the worse.Mickelson hit his tee shot on No.10 into the woods on the left, punched out and then his third shot rolled off the front of the green.He was able to get up and down for bogey.Then Mickelson hit his second shot on No.11 into the water for another bogey.Just like that, he was sitting at even par."It looked like after bogeying 10 and 11 that would kill some momentum," Mickelson said."It was the other way around, because I made two great bogeys that should have and could have been doubles.After going in the water at 11 to hit that close and have an easy bogey and then to make a 6-footer for bogey on 10 after a terrible drive, those were almost momentum maintainers, if you will, that kept me in it."Mickelson responded with birdies on five of the last seven holes for a 5-under 67, 1 shot behind the co-leaders.It was his seventh career round at the Masters in which he was under par on all four par-5s.In each previous instance, according to ESPN Stats & Information research, he finished in the top five, including two of his three victories in 2006 and 2010."Look, the greens are softer than they've ever been, and they're not as fast as they normally are," Mickelson said."So [Thursday] was a day to take advantage of it.I'm sure they'll get firmer and faster as the week goes on."Some big names with work to do Rory McIlroy came into Augusta as the betting favorite, but he limped through a six-bogey, five-birdie opening round to finish 1-over 73.McIlroy hit only seven of 14 fairways and needed 32 putts through the first 18 holes, leaving him a lot of work to do to get back into the mix on Friday."Yeah, it was OK," McIlroy said."The conditions weren't that difficult.I felt the course was there.It's soft.There's not much wind.I made five birdies, that wasn't the problem.I just made too many mistakes, and that was the problem.And I'm making mistakes from pretty simple positions, just off the side of the green, 17 and 18 being prime examples of that."Other big-name players who have work to do on Friday to avoid missing the cut: Zach Johnson (2 over), Jordan Spieth (3 over), Justin Rose (3 over), Hideki Matsuyama (3 over), Brandt Snedeker (3 over), Henrik Stenson (3 over), Keegan Bradley (4 over), Fred Couples (6 over) and Paul Casey (9 over).Players with the 50 lowest scores, including ties, and any player within 10 shots of the second-round leader advance to the weekend at the Masters.When the key players hit the course Friday's

that?There are plenty of recognizable names atop the leaderboard after the first round, but you might have to Google a few of the not-so-familiar ones as you watch the second round.South African Justin Harding, a first-time Masters invitee, spent most of his first round atop the leaderboard after firing an early 3-under 69.Harding, who might be recognizable because of his long-handed putter, has won five times since the 2018 Masters -- each of his victories came overseas.He has appeared in two PGA Tour majors, missing the cut at both the 2018 PGA Championship and 2013 Open Championship with a combined score of 12 over.Harding credits "consistency and becoming a little better mentally" for his improved play."[I'm] no longer really going through the highs and lows and the emotional roller coaster, so to speak," Harding said."But that also comes in not really playing the aggressive mindset game that I was in the past.I'm hitting 3-woods off tees a little more often now, laying

Masters after winning last week's Valero Texas Open as a Monday qualifier.He flew to Augusta on Valero's private jet Sunday night, took Monday easy and then practiced Tuesday before shopping for

Tiger has a shot at the Masters, and that's all he needs:::::AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Tiger Woods' caddie, Joe LaCava, was sitting near the Augusta National practice putting green at the end of a long, hot day in the sun, waiting for his employer to show up to work overtime on his stroke.Dressed in Masters white, the caddie was talking about his cherished football Giants before he got going on his man's chances to win a fifth green jacket."I think it could've been something in the 60s," LaCava said of Woods' two-under 70 on Thursday."Ballstriking-wise, it was probably a 68 or a 69.But we'll take 70."Yes, Tiger had good reason to take his 70 out of the chute at Augusta National.He shot that score in the opening rounds of his Masters victories in 1997, 2000 and 2001, before overcoming a 74 to win in 2005."I've shot this number and won four coats," he said, erroneously, "so, hopefully, I can do it again."Tiger Woods is in the mix at this Masters.That's all he wants.Andrew Redington/Getty Images Woods could be forgiven for his lapse in memory.He is 43 after all, a fact regularly hammered home by a hairline that keeps running away from him.But even if his comments to the news media were made when he was a mere one stroke off the midafternoon pace -- and before Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau finished with a share of the lead, thanks to 6-under 66s -- Woods had earned his stated faith in himself.Woods nearly won back-to-back majors last year.He didn't win The Open or the PGA Championship, but he did end his five-year-plus overall winless drought last fall at the Tour Championship, where he said he proved to himself -- with career victory No.80 -- that he had rediscovered how to win a big golf tournament.Nothing is bigger in this sport than the Masters, of course, and it has been 14 years since Tiger eagerly slid into one of those coats.But he still has to be taken seriously as a credible leaderboard threat to Koepka, DeChambeau, Phil Mickelson and the rest."He's swinging good," LaCava said."He's driving it pretty well, his iron game is pretty good and he's working on his short game really hard.That's coming around.So, he's certainly going in the right direction."There's going to be a lot of scores higher than 70, so I don't get too crazy on Day 1.But it's nice to start with anything under par."In fact, Thursday marked the first time Woods broke par in the first round of the Masters since 2013.His past nine opening rounds in major championships included two at even par and seven north of par.When Tiger birdied the 14th hole at Augusta National, he moved to 3-under after his opening 14 holes for the first time in his 22 Masters appearances, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.On that 14th hole, Woods recovered from a wayward drive by hitting a majestic shot high over the trees and onto the green."I've seen him hit that shot a million times," LaCava said, "but still, you've got to pull it off.Under the circumstances, it was a hell of a shot."Wearing a mock turtleneck borrowed from his dynastic prime -- this one a sharp navy blue -- the old Woods looked like the Woods of old when he drained the long putt and pumped his right fist in the air."I feel very good," Woods said."I feel like I played well [Thursday] and I controlled my golf ball all day."He did miss short putts at Nos.5 and 6.He did drop his iron to the ground after a wayward approach at No.7.Woods made a mess of a birdie opportunity at the 15th, and he couldn't recover from another tee shot into the trees at the 17th.But his moments of frustration didn't define the round.Woods played smartly out of bunkers, and he seemed to stay within himself the entire round."It's not a bad start," he said.Not even close.And now, Tiger needs to do what he couldn't at last summer's PGA Championship -- run down Brooks Koepka, already a three-time major winner.The young slugger and old slugger shared some time together Wednesday night at the annual Golf Writers Association of America awards dinner.Koepka won player of the year and Woods the Ben Hogan Award for his comeback from debilitating back pain and fusion surgery.Koepka was presented his award first, and as is customary for the player of the year, he was treated to a video montage of his brilliant season.Woods received his award next, and as is customary for the Ben Hogan winner, he was introduced to the audience with a verbal presentation (this one delivered by ESPN's Bob Harig)."How come I didn't get a video?"Woods immediately said at the podium, drawing spirited laughter from the crowd."I got Bob Harig."Woods was joking, but his humor is almost always inspired by genuine feelings.On his way out of the banquet room, Woods complained again to Harig (sorta jokingly) that he wasn't celebrated with a Koepka-esque video tribute.Truth was, Woods delivered a heartfelt speech about his injuries, about how he couldn't "participate in life" and play with his kids two years ago and about how he thought his career was over.He thanked the assembled golf writers for promoting the game and for meeting his comeback with supportive commentary."I can't thank you enough," Tiger said.Some people in the audience were stunned; they had never heard Woods speak in such endearing tones, especially about the media.But time and circumstance conspired to change the man, for the better, making him an easier contender to root for than he was in the past.Now, he finds himself on the perimeter of contention at the Masters with 54 holes to play, behind some big names with big games.Is a Woods victory still plausible?"Tiger could be 75 years old," PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan recently told ESPN, "and if he showed up at a tournament, I would say he has a chance to win."Woods certainly showed up at a tournament on Thursday, something he thought would never again be possible.He has overcome something much more daunting than a four-stroke Masters deficit.Don't count him out yet.
Hall of Fame lineman Forrest Gregg dies at 85:::::Forrest Gregg, who earned the nickname "Iron Man" for playing in a then-record 188 consecutive NFL games during his Hall of Fame career, died Friday at the age of 85, it was announced.Hall of Famer and @packers legend Forrest Gregg passed away today at the age of 85.More on his legacy: https://t.co/ncTv8xnGBQ pic.twitter.com/usAksqdj9p Pro Football Hall of Fame (@ProFootballHOF) April 12, 2019 The former offensive lineman, who was a six-time All-Pro and nine-time Pro Bowler, played 15 seasons in the NFL with the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys from 1956 to 1971.He went on to coach the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns and Packers, compiling a record of 75-85-1.He led Cincinnati to the Super Bowl after the 1981 season, where the Bengals lost to San Francisco 26-21."The game lost a giant today," Hall of Fame president David Baker said in a statement."Forrest Gregg exemplified greatness during a legendary career that earned him a Bronzed Bust in Canton.He was the type of player who led by example and, in doing so, raised the level of play of all those around him.Forrest symbolized many great traits and virtues that can be learned from this Game to inspire people from all walks of life."Forrest Gregg, called "the best player I ever coached" by Vince Lombardi, won six NFL titles with the Packers and Cowboys.After his playing career, he coached the Bengals, Browns and Packers.He was enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.Manny Rubio/USA TODAY Sports A guard and tackle, Gregg won a-half dozen NFL championships, including the first two Super Bowls with the Packers.Gregg finished his career with another Super Bowl title with the Cowboys in 1971.He was enshrined into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1977.Legendary coach Vince Lombardi once called Gregg "the best player I ever coached."The Packers selected Gregg, who played collegiately at SMU, in the second round of the 1956 NFL draft.Gregg was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2011, and he had overcome melanoma in 1976 and colon cancer in 2001.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Mickelson has best 1st round at Masters since '10:::::AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Even coming here with a series of bad results fresh in his mind, Phil Mickelson knew things were likely to change when he drove down Magnolia Lane.Augusta National provides Lefty a freedom he feels is missing at regular PGA Tour venues, and that showed during a first-round 67 at the Masters.Mickelson, 48, opened the tournament with his best first round since shooting the same score in 2010, when he won the third of his three green jackets.There is a long way to go, but a victory at the Masters would make Mickelson the oldest to win a major championship in the game's history, surpassing the record held since 1968 by Julius Boros."It was great.It was a lot of fun,'' said Mickelson, who is in third place, one stroke behind leaders Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka."And it's fun to finish off the round.It's fun to make a good par save on 17 and birdie the last.It's fun to finish a good round off rather than leak one here or there coming in.So it was a good day.''There had been few of those for Mickelson since winning the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am for his 44th PGA Tour title in February.In five events, his best finish was a tie for 37th, and he missed two cuts.Two weeks ago at the WGC-Dell Match Play Championship, Mickelson lost each of his first two matches, rendering the final-day victory over Jason Day meaningless.But he immediately headed to Augusta and spent four days practicing here before heading home to San Diego, where the putting green at his home was set to lightning-fast pace to deal with the speed of the Masters greens."I was just hoping to shoot in the 60s," Mickelson said."I thought there were some 66s out there.Look, the greens are softer than they've ever been, and they're not as fast as they normally are.So today was a day to take advantage of it.I'm sure they'll get firmer and faster as the week goes on.But you could get after the pins and you could putt aggressively."
Gruden's draft advice to Mayock: Don't mess it up:::::Jim Nagy and Dan Orlovsky choose the players the Raiders should target with their three first-round selections in this year's NFL draft.(1:31) ALAMEDA, Calif. -- Jon Gruden has some pointed advice for his new general manager as Mike Mayock approaches his first NFL draft as the Oakland Raiders' general manager, after years as a draft analyst for NFL Network.Especially with the Raiders holding so much draft capital."Don't mess it up, dude," Gruden told Mayock."I took a lot of slings to get you three first-round picks."Indeed, Gruden is still taking flak for last fall's trades of All-Pro edge rusher Khalil Mack and Pro Bowl receiver Amari Cooper that netted Oakland first-round picks from the Chicago Bears (No.24 overall) and Dallas Cowboys (No.27) to go with their own pick at No.4.But consider: The Raiders are just the fourth team in the past 30 years -- the first since the 2001 Rams -- to enter draft day with three first-rounders.Mess it up?Mayock is embracing the challenge."You always have to go back to trusting who you are as an evaluator," said Mayock, who also said his board will be stacked by the end of next week.Oakland, who finished 4-12 last season and has already added 19 players this offseason, has just three defensive ends on the roster.That's despite ending the year with a league-low 13 sacks, 17 fewer than anyone other NFL team last season.In fact, six individual players had more sacks than Oakland did as a team.So how fine is that line between drafting for need and drafting the best player available?As Raiders two-time Super Bowl-winning coach Tom Flores said, if you're picking in the top 10, you don't have the luxury of drafting for a specific need because you have needs all over the roster."I'm a son of a coach and I know how coaches think, and coaches think need," Mayock said."And we're a coach-driven building; our coaches are highly involved.That's good.I embrace that.The flip side is, you can't reach.You've got to use some common sense.And that's what I preach."Mayock said that if two players at different positions rank similarly, but one is at a higher position of need, "Great, let's go get him," Mayock said."But if there's a discount, a disparity between the two [players], let's not reach for need because the more you do that, the more you dilute your roster.And that's a conversation we've had a lot."In his former job as a TV GM, Mayock would put together a draft board based on "league value" and would share it with general managers across the league.Now?Raider Nation state secrets are at stake.That's why other GMs may be trying to get Mayock to slip up and let them know of the Raiders' draft plans... before he turns the tables."I miss just talking ball with you," Mayock recounted someone telling him recently."Yeah, same thing," Mayock answered."Who are you going to take?"Mayock laughed, even as he says he is not worried about his reputation heading into his first draft as a real GM, or about Gruden's playful jab."The way I look at this thing from a how-do-people-perceive-me perspective is a lot of people doubted that anybody could come out of the media and go and be a GM for any team," Mayock said."I know that.I get that."But at the end of the day, here's the deal -- if we win, everything will be fine.And if we lose, I'll get fired.And I'm perfectly fine with that."Before that day possibly comes, though, there is the April 25-27 draft, in which the Raiders hold eight picks, with half of them coming in the first 35.The flip side is that Oakland does not have a pick from 36 to 105, missing a lot of what Mayock sees as his sweet spot between 20 and 60."Between 24, 27 and 35 we have three awesome opportunities," Mayock said."I happen to like 20 through 60.Always have.I think there are a lot of guys that love the game and are safer picks, sometimes, than top-10 picks."I'd love to get a couple more picks in there.We've got a lot of holes that need to be filled, and I think that's a really good place to go fishing."That would mean the Raiders have to trade to get there.Although they have the capital and flexibility to make moves with those four picks in the top 35, Mayock was noncommittal about dealing two weeks ahead of the draft."We have to be ready to pick at 4 and be excited about a player, right?"Mayock said."Now, we might move up, we might move back.Who knows?We won't know until draft night.But, if we're, quote, stuck at 4, we've got to be ready to go, and that's a hell of a lot easier than worrying about all the permutations at 24 and 27 and 35."And if the Raiders simply stay put with those first four selections?"We better get four foundation football players," Mayock said."We define foundation as talent and football character.That's what we want.Guys that love the game.And if we don't move up or down or anywhere, man, we better get four of those guys."We need to be nimble."
Cavs not bringing back Drew for second season:::::CLEVELAND -- The Cavaliers' next coach will inherit a better situation than the one Larry Drew was handed.Drew and the Cavs parted ways Thursday after a challenging, 19-win season that followed LeBron James leaving for Los Angeles and included a rash of injuries to a young roster.Although expected, Drew's departure creates more work for a franchise that will sit out the NBA playoffs this season following a four-year run in the NBA Finals with James.Drew, 61, met with general manager Koby Altman, and the two decided it was best for them to go in separate directions.Altman said in a release that Drew "respectfully declined to participate in the search process and will not be returning to coach the Cavaliers."Editor's Picks Grizzlies fire Bickerstaff in major shake-up The Grizzlies have fired coach J.B. Bickerstaff and reassigned general manager Chris Wallace in a big front-office shake-up.Kings' Divac fires Joerger after 39-win season Kings GM Vlade Divac, whose contract was extended through the 2022-23 season, has fired coach Dave Joerger after dismissing assistant GM Brandon Williams earlier Thursday.1 Related The Cavs tied for the league's second-worst record with Phoenix, but Drew kept his team playing hard until the end.He received praise from many of his players, including All-Star forward Kevin Love, who was limited to just 22 games following toe surgery."We have great respect and appreciation for Larry and the job that he did as the head coach of the Cavaliers for nearly the entire 2018-19 campaign," Altman said in a release."He brought professionalism, class and steady leadership both this past season and [the] prior four years.All of us in Cleveland wish Larry nothing but the best going forward."Altman will embark on a search for Cleveland's fifth coach since 2013.The Cavs will consider college coaches, NBA assistants and former head coaches to continue the rebuild Drew started.Altman is scheduled to outline some of his plans during a news conference Friday at the team's facility in Independence, Ohio.Larry Drew and the Cavaliers parted ways on Thursday after Drew met with general manager Koby Altman and they agreed a new direction was best for everyone.David Richard-USA TODAY Sports The Cavs job is enticing on several fronts.Owner Dan Gilbert has displayed a willingness to spend, and Cleveland could land one of the top college prospects depending on how things go in next month's draft lottery.Drew took over when Tyronn Lue, who led the Cavs to a title in 2016, was fired Oct. 28 following an 0-6 start.Drew spent three seasons with the Cavs, joining Lue's staff for the championship season.When he replaced Lue, Drew, who previously coached in Atlanta and Milwaukee, knew the Cavs might go in another direction at some point and asked the team to restructure his contract, which it did.Drew's steadying influence helped the Cavs endure injuries that led him to use a league-high 32 different lineups.He also helped in the development of rookie point guard Collin Sexton, who finished strong after a slow start and appears to be a building block for the future."I want to thank Dan Gilbert, Koby Altman, the entire organization and especially our fans, for what has been a very special and rewarding time here in Cleveland," Drew said."Koby and I had a good discussion following the season and have both decided that the best decision for each of us was that I would not return to coach the team.I am very proud of what we accomplished over the last several years together and will always cherish our championship."I also want to commend our players this season for the bond that they established, the way they approached their jobs and the hard work and growth they had every day.I am very proud of them and wish them the best as they continue to develop for the future."
Duke's Reddish declares for draft after 'epic' year:::::Duke freshman Cam Reddish said on social media Thursday that he was declaring for the NBA draft.Reddish, the No.7 prospect on ESPN's Top 100, averaged 13.5 points in just under 30 minutes a game this season.Reddish's teammate RJ Barrett announced Wednesday that he was entering the draft, which leaves only Zion Williamson among Duke's Big Three who has yet to declare.Starting point guard Tre Jones announced Monday that he would be back at Duke for his sophomore season.
Jets bring on Montgomery to back up Bell:::::The New York Jets added a veteran backup behind Le'Veon Bell, signing former Baltimore Ravens running back Ty Montgomery on Thursday.A league source told ESPN's Adam Schefter that it's a one-year deal.Montgomery also has experience as a kickoff returner, another need for the Jets, who hosted the free agent this week on a visit.He also drew interest from the Miami Dolphins.Jets coach Adam Gase has spoken highly of backup Elijah McGuire, but he evidently wanted a more experienced player behind Bell, the team's marquee addition in free agency.Montgomery, 26, was traded Oct. 30 to the Ravens, two days after an ill-advised kickoff return contributed to a Green Bay Packers loss to the Los Angeles Rams.He was told to take a knee, but Montgomery took the ball out of the end zone and fumbled, and the Rams held on for the win.In six games for the Ravens, Montgomery rushed for 83 yards on 15 carries, with no touchdowns.He also caught 10 passes for 65 yards.Montgomery, a third-round pick in 2015, began his career as a wide receiver, but he switched to running back in 2016.He averaged 5.9 yards per carry that year for the Packers -- 457 yards on 77 carries.He also caught a career-high 44 passes for 348 yards in 2016.Montgomery will join Bell, McGuire and Trenton Cannon in the Jets' backfield.The Jets also visited with Kansas City Chiefs free agent Spencer Ware before signing Montgomery.
Lomachenko-Crolla breakdown Who has the advantage?:::::Anthony Crolla starts as a 'massive underdog' against Vasyl Lomachenko according to Steve Bunce, but will he pull off a huge shock in LA?(1:42) Unified lightweight world champion Vasiliy Lomachenko defends his WBA and WBO belts against former titleholder Anthony Crolla at 11 p.m.ET Friday in a fight that will air live on ESPN+ in the United States from Staples Center in Los Angeles, California.Can Crolla pull off one of the biggest upsets in boxing history and humble the sport's pound-for-pound king?ESPN breaks down the fight.Technique Vasiliy Lomachenko is always ready to fight 12 rounds, even when he's most likely to finish his opponents early.Ed Mulholland/Matchroom Boxing UK It's a no-brainer -- and Crolla admits as much.The Briton knows he can't outskill the most talented boxer in the sport today, who is known as "Hi-Tech" due to his flawless technique.Neither will Crolla try to turn Friday's fight into a street brawl."You can't just go in there and rough him up," Crolla told ESPN."I'm never going to outbox him or outthink him, but there will be times when I will try and box off him.I can't let him box how he wants to."Lomachenko (12-1, 9 KOs), 31, is a two-time Olympic gold medalist with breathtaking, mesmerizing skills that have ensured he has dominated his weight classes at the amateur and professional levels.The U.S.-based Ukrainian is widely regarded as boxing's pound-for-pound No.1, but five years ago, he lost in his second professional fight to Mexican Orlando Salido, a veteran who roughed him up for a split-decision victory.Crolla (34-6-3, 13 KOs), 32, who held the WBA belt from 2015 to 2016, does not regard the Salido fight as a blueprint for how to beat Lomachenko and a way to nullify his silky skills."I'm not looking too much into the Salido fight," Crolla told ESPN."It was only his second pro fight.Salido missed weight and then roughed him up."Lomachenko is a totally different fighter, and it's years on, but there is a bit of that fight I will look at, and we can take from it.But he's changed a lot since then.[But] you can't just go in there and rough him up."Crolla will have to bring something to the ring other than a hammer if he is going to cause Lomachenko any concern.Advantage: Lomachenko Speed Vasiliy Lomachenko is fast and quick, both with punches and movements, and that makes him hard to hit.Mikey Williams/Top Rank This is no contest, and Crolla's ability to cope with Lomachenko's blurring hand speed will determine how long he can stay in the fight.Lomachenko has left opponents bamboozled by his speed for years and there are no signs he is slowing up.His movement has been compared to the Matrix, the science fiction film featuring Keanu Reeves, since his punches are thrown at such speed and accuracy they are like laser beams.Crolla's hand speed does not compare, and perhaps his best method of dealing with it is by looking to hold whenever possible.Lomachenko's quick hands will be one of Crolla's biggest concern.Crolla could not find a way to beat Linares, another skilled technician with fast hands, in two fights so it is hard to come up with an argument how the Briton can find a solution against the best in the business.Advantage: Lomachenko Tactics play 1:33 Bunce: Lomachenko's 'sickening' body shots can beat Crolla ESPN's Steve Bunce says the Ukrainian champion 'just needs to be Lomachenko' to defeat Anthony Crolla in LA.The Ukrainian genius has so much in his arsenal, and Crolla admits that Lomachenko might produce something he has not prepared for.Crolla, who was twice beaten by Jorge Linares by unanimous decisions in 2016 and 2017, has watched hours of footage of Lomachenko, as well as southpaws such as Manny Pacquiao, but admits it might have been pointless."I can't worry too much about what he's going to come out and do because he's capable of coming out and doing something completely different that we haven't seen before," Crolla told ESPN."With Lomachenko, you really are second-guessing because he's so unorthodox, and he's a unique boxer.We are trying to cover it the best we can with sparring partners.But on the night, he could do something totally different.Jose Pedraza had some success, but Lomachenko found a way to win [by unanimous decision in December].Me and Linares are totally different, but [Linares] did fantastic against Lomachenko.He was right in the fight until the stoppage [Lomachenko won in the 10th round but was down in round six].I'm trying to take bits [of what] different fighters have done well against him into the fight."Pedraza and Linares hit Lomachenko more than he had been in other fights, and Crolla will take some heart from that.Crolla will try to keep the champion under pressure, but Lomachenko's boxing IQ is unlikely to see him outsmarted.Lomachenko, who trains in California, finds more angles than a geometry textbook, and it will be a matter of time before Crolla can keep the champion's punches at bay.Tactically, Lomachenko has not come close to getting it wrong since the harsh lesson he learned against Salido.It is hard to see how Lomachenko, with his skills and brilliant brain, could get it so wrong and lose to Crolla, who was twice beaten by Linares.Advantage: Lomachenko Knockout power Vasiliy Lomachenko's power is undeniable.He has stopped eight of his past 10 opponents.Matt Hazlett/Getty Images Crolla's best chance of pulling off a monumental upset is by KO, given that we already established that he has no chance of outboxing Lomachenko.Crolla has recently shown that he has the potential to stop elite fighters with devastating body shots."Million Dollar" Crolla dispatched Darleys Perez and Ismael Barroso in WBA title fights in 2015 and 2016 before he lost the belt to Linares.Crolla is a big underdog, but he has been motivated by the chance to shock the world and write himself into the history books.Beating Lomachenko would rank alongside the biggest upsets in British boxing history, along with Lloyd Honeyghan's 1986 triumph over Donald Curry and Randolph Turpin's outpointing the great Sugar Ray Robinson in 1951."He's got a strong argument to be the best fighter on the planet, but it's still very early days about how good he is," Crolla said of Lomachenko."He's certainly got the ability and had a fantastic amateur career -- as good as it gets.But as a pro, he's had [only] 13 fights, and I think we have got to wait a bit longer before we judge.It's an honor to fight him -- it really is -- but I'm going in there to shock the world.My mindset is not about how good he is.I'm trying to beat him.The upset is a big motivation."The reality is Crolla is not a known knockout puncher.Only one opponent -- Pedraza in December -- was able to hear the final bell against Lomachenko since Suriya Tatakhun went the distance in 2014.Advantage: Lomachenko Stamina When it comes to boxing tactics, Vasiliy Lomachenko is one of the best in the business.Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images Lomachenko is such an athlete that he probably would have excelled at another sport, such as gymnastics, ice hockey or soccer, had he not taken up boxing in his childhood.Lomachenko's reflexes, coordination, footwork and stamina are faultless.The Ukrainian is comfortable going the full 12-round championship distance, having done so four times in 13 professional fights, and there are no questions about him running out of steam.There should be none about Crolla, either.The Briton has not done road running as part of his training regime since 2014, but do not think he is taking shortcuts.Crolla lives a clean lifestyle and has hit his best form since he suffered a fractured skull and broken ankle in an attack by burglars he chased off from a neighbor's house in December 2014.Now Crolla relies on swimming, yoga and hours spent on an exercise bike, as well as boxing work with trainer Joe Gallagher.Crolla has gone 12 rounds in four of his past five fights, and expect him to keep marching forward through swollen eyes and lacerations as long as he is allowed to do so or is able to do so.Advantage: Lomachenko Form Vasiliy Lomachenko is one of the best-prepared fighters in boxing.Josh Lefkowitz/Getty Images Crolla has had to be resilient to get where he is this week, taking on the best there is in boxing.After six career defeats and career-threatening injuries following a street attack, Crolla has heart in abundance.Crolla has rebounded from a brace of points losses to Linares with three straight decision wins.They were comfortable enough, though Crolla had some difficult moments before pulling ahead by four rounds on all three scorecards against Daud Yordan of Indonesia in November.Crolla won by a larger margin against Edson Ramirez over 10 rounds a year ago, though he had to contend with cuts, and the victory over former three-weight world titleholder Ricky Burns in October 2017 was impressive.Crolla won after looking the fresher and smarter boxer.It was an impressive response from Crolla seven months after he lost his WBA belt to Linares.Crolla has shown that he still has the appetite and ambition, but will that be enough to outshine Lomachenko with all the qualities he has showcased in recent dazzling displays?The logic says Crolla can't come close to beating Lomachenko, who in recent fights has looked outstanding against Pedraza, Linares, Guillermo Rigondeaux, Miguel Marriaga and Jason Sosa.Advantage: Lomachenko Your take
Ringside Seat: Crolla earned shot against Lomachenko -- winning is another story:::::As part of his training World Lightweight Champion Vasiliy Lomachenko submerges himself in a pool and holds his breath until his body asks him for a breath of fresh air.(2:00) Pound-for-pound king Vasiliy Lomachenko has always been vocal about the kinds of fights he wants: big ones.He wants to win as many belts in as many divisions as he can, and he wants title unification fights.In just 13 professional bouts, Lomachenko, a two-time Olympic gold medalist from Ukraine and viewed by many as the greatest amateur boxer in history thanks to a 396-1 record, has already won world titles in three weight classes: featherweight, junior lightweight and lightweight.In his most recent fight, he got a chance to unify two belts, doing so at lightweight with a one-sided decision over Jose Pedraza in a December fight in which he dropped Pedraza twice in the 11th round to punctuate the victory.Now Lomachenko is set for his third lightweight bout and ready to make his second title defense against former titlist and mandatory challenger Anthony Crolla, whom he will meet in the main event of a Top Rank Boxing on ESPN+ card on Friday (ESPN+, 11 p.m.ET main card, 8 p.m.ET for preliminaries) at Staples Center in Los Angeles.The fight was scheduled to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the debut of ESPN+.Lomachenko is a huge favorite to defeat Crolla, but that is certainly no knock on Crolla.Lomachenko would be heavily favored to beat anyone in the world at lightweight and below not named fellow lightweight titleholder Mikey Garcia.But a fight with Garcia or another unification bout was not available to Lomachenko for this date, and without a unification fight being possible he was ordered to make the mandatory against Crolla."I want to fight the best, but now Crolla is the best choice," Lomachenko said."He is the mandatory challenger and wanted to fight me.That is why I accepted this fight.I prepare like always and will put on a great performance for my fans in Los Angeles and on ESPN+.I will show everyone my best style and hope everyone enjoys it."Crolla (34-6-3, 13 KOs), 32, had become one of Lomachenko's mandatory challengers when he won a unanimous decision over Daud Yordan in a title eliminator on Nov. 10 in Manchester, England, Crolla's hometown.Had Lomachenko not taken the fight, he would have been stripped of one of his belts.Given his tunnel vision of wanting to win all the belts in his division, there was no way he would have allowed that to happen.So Crolla, who is experienced, hungry and has a dogged determination and belief in himself, gets another title shot."It's been a long camp and the hardest of my career, physically and mentally, but I am in a great place and I'm raring to go," Crolla said."He's seen by many as the best fighter on the planet and I know that I have a huge challenge ahead of me.But these are the kinds of fights that I got into the sport for at the age of 10.I've dreamt about nights like this and it's almost time."This is your Ringside Seat for the fight: Crolla, not Commey Anthony Crolla, right, defeated Daud Yordan in a title eliminator fight in November.Richard Heathcote/Getty Images Lomachenko (12-1, 9 KOs), a 31-year-old southpaw, had hoped to quench his desire to unify titles by facing fellow 135-pound belt-holder Richard Commey (28-2, 25 KOs).In fact, Top Rank had in place a deal for the winner of the vacant world title fight between Commey and Isa Chaniev on Feb. 2 to face Lomachenko next.However, when Commey won the title by drilling Chaniev in the second round, he injured his right hand, putting him on the shelf for several weeks and making him unavailable to face Lomachenko on Friday.That turn of events dropped the bout in Crolla's lap, although if Lomachenko wins he probably will face Commey, who was cleared to return to training last week, later in the year.Crolla, who will be boxing in the United States for the first time and outside of the United Kingdom for the second time, was happy to get the fight.He has big respect for Lomachenko but is unmoved by the underdog status."He's a very unique fighter, his movement is exceptional and he creates great angles," Crolla said about Lomachenko."You can see what all the praise is about.He's one of the greatest amateurs ever and he's taken that into the pro ranks.It's unbelievable what he's done in a short space of time in the pros, but I am here not just to test myself against the very best but to give it everything I have to shock the world."People aren't giving me a chance but that doesn't matter to me.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.The motivation to me is attaching my name to one of the biggest upsets in British boxing history without a doubt, and I don't think I'm speaking out of turn there.As a boxing fan and someone that lives and breathes the sport, that's all the motivation I need.I've been the underdog all throughout my career and I know that this is by far the biggest challenge I've faced, but it's one I can't wait to get stuck into."Underdog or not, Joe Gallagher, Crolla's trainer, said whatever happens, his man will give it everything he has like other fighters he has trained have done when taking on pound-for-pound stars.play 4:36 Crolla ready to defy odds against Lomachenko Former titlist Anthony Crolla is no stranger to being an underdog and is now ready to take on reigning champion Vasyl Lomachenko."It helps that I've been in this position before," Gallagher told the U.K.'s Sky Sports."Do I think that [Paul Smith] was disgraced against Andre Ward?No.Was Liam Smith disgraced when he fought [Canelo] Alvarez?Not a chance."This is just part of the business when you're going in against guys at the absolute highest level of the sport and I know for an absolute fact that whatever the result when Crolla takes on Lomachenko, he'll give it his all and he won't disgrace himself either."Common opponent: Linares Vasiliy Lomachenko, right, stopped Jorge Linares in May 2018 to take the lightweight world championship.Al Bello/Getty Images The most obvious way to compare Lomachenko and Crolla is based on how each performed against a common opponent in Jorge Linares, the well-respected former three-division world titleholder.Lomachenko said he is familiar with Crolla only because he fought Linares."I don't know too much about him," Lomachenko said."I know him from his two fights with Jorge Linares.I do know he is an aggressive fighter, and I like to fight guys who come forward."Crolla won a lightweight title in 2015 and made one defense before squaring off with Linares in Manchester in September 2016.It was a fantastic fight and highly competitive, but Linares' speed, skills and outstanding body attack gave Crolla problems and he lost the belt by unanimous decision.They met six months later in an immediate rematch, also in Manchester, and Linares had a much easier time, knocking Crolla down in the seventh round and winning a more decisive decision, after which Crolla won three fights in a row to set up the Lomachenko fight.Linares would go on to retain the title twice more before defending against Lomachenko, who was moving up from junior lightweight, last May at a raucous Madison Square Garden in New York.Linares dropped Lomachenko in the sixth round of a very competitive fight in which Lomachenko, despite suffering a torn labrum in his right shoulder in the second round, rallied for a dramatic body-shot knockout victory in the 10th round to take the title in a fight that was even on the scorecards entering the round.Although comparing results against a common opponent is not necessarily a predictor of what is to come -- after all, Muhammad Ali lost to Joe Frazier, who lost to George Foreman, who lost to Ali -- it is worth noting that Crolla lost twice to Linares, who was knocked out by an injured Lomachenko.Face to face ESPN Stats and Information Lomachenko: Making the second defense of the WBA lightweight title, first of WBO lightweight title Lomachenko: 11-fight win streak dating to June 2014 Lomachenko: 6-1 vs. world titleholders -- only loss came to Orlando Salido in 2014 (split decision in his second fight as a professional).Two-time Olympic gold medalist for Ukraine (2008, 2012) Lomachenko: Lands 47.7 percent of power punches, according to CompuBox (lightweight average is 36.1 percent).Opponents land 17.2 percent of punches, second lowest, according to CompuBox Crolla: Has won three straight fights after

landed punches land on the body, CompuBox average is 28 percent.Lands 38.9 percent of power punches, lightweight average is 35.7 percent, according to CompuBox Lomachenko's future?Certainly, if Lomachenko wins, the Commey fight remains on the drawing board for later this year.But what else is there for Lomachenko, especially given that a fight with Garcia is so unlikely for several reasons, including questions about whether Garcia will ever even fight at lightweight again?"I still want that fight, 100 percent, but it is up to Mikey," Lomachenko said."Can he cut the weight?I don't know.But if he can make 135, I want to fight."Last month, Garcia lost a shutout decision to Errol Spence Jr. in a welterweight title fight, but Garcia has not decided whether he'll return to lightweight.If he doesn't, that would leave his belt vacant and it's not out of the question that Lomachenko could fight for it or perhaps the winner of that belt.Lomachenko is not a big lightweight by any means, so he has also said there is a chance that for the right fight he would return to junior lightweight."Right now, I am a lightweight, but lightweight is not my ideal weight category," he said."My goal now is to unify all four titles, and then, we'll see.Maybe I'll move back down to 130 pounds and win world titles there for a second time."Although this possible fight doesn't fall into the unification category, it would be somewhat of a significant bout: Miguel Berchelt.He holds a junior lightweight belt, and should he defeat former titlist Francisco Vargas in their May 11 rematch, Berchelt and Top Rank have talked about a possible fight with Lomachenko.Of course, maybe Lomachenko would want to return to junior lightweight and challenge him for the belt in that division.Then there is also one other fight that would surely create huge buzz against 2018 ESPN prospect of the year Teofimo Lopez Jr. (12-0, 10 KOs), an electrifying 21-year-old and 2016 Olympian who has dazzled on Lomachenko undercards and called out for a fight with Lomachenko, something few fighters do.Lomachenko would have little to gain from the fight unless Lopez could find his way to a title first, but it would be a big promotion, create huge fan interest and is certainly makeable since they are both with Top Rank.Asked about his interest in that fight, Lomachenko said, "I'm ready for everyone.I need the belts.If you have a belt, you can come in the ring and I'll fight with you.My goal is to unify all the titles.If it's Commey later this year, that would be a great fight.Any champion, I would want to fight.I want to go down in history as a great champion."Crolla is hoping to render that discussion moot."I've boxed at elite level before, I've been boxing at world title level for years and I've earned this shot; it's not been given to me," Crolla said."I know that I have to pull off something massive, but I do belong at this level and I'll prove it.I won't be in awe.I've worked far too hard to let that happen and I am confident."It's just me and him in the ring.Like any sport, you need that little bit of luck, but I have worked immensely hard to get as lucky as I can, but we're going in with a good game plan and I cannot be better prepared."Rafael's prediction: Lomachenko by wide decision.Your take:
Giannis is the best basketball player alive:::::At 24 years old, Giannis Antetokounmpo is the best basketball player in the world.He is the best offensive player on a top-five NBA offense.He's the best defensive player on the No.1 defense.As the catalyst of an incredible basketball system, Giannis has led the Milwaukee Bucks to the best record in the NBA and home-court advantage throughout the playoffs.With respect to Houston's bearded prophet, Antetokounmpo isn't just this season's MVP.He is the perfect two-way superstar for where the NBA is right now -- and where it's going.A revolutionary throwback on offense Let's start on offense -- specifically Giannis' favorite spot on the floor.Owning the paint Antetokounmpo has quickly surpassed some dude named LeBron James as the league's premier interior force.He also is doing things we haven't seen since Shaquille O'Neal was in his prime.Check this out: Most paint points (past 20 years) Player Season Points Shaquille O'Neal 1999-00 1,774 Shaquille O'Neal 2000-01 1,480 Shaquille O'Neal 2001-02 1,348 Shaquille O'Neal 2002-03 1,312 Shaquille O'Neal 2004-05 1,266 Giannis Antetokounmpo 2018-19 1,226 If the NBA analytics era has taught us anything, it's that the best shots in the game occur either beyond the arc or near the hoop.The Bucks bask in both zones.Giannis makes hay at the rim, yet he does it so much better than everyone else, partially because his team is woke to the spacing movement."If you don't knock down shots, then everybody's gonna be in the paint," Antetokounmpo told ESPN.com last week."[My teammates have] been making shots all year, so it gives me a lot of space to make plays for them and myself."Simply put, he has become the most self-sufficient dunker we've seen in decades.After dropping 19 unassisted dunks as a rookie in 2013-14, Giannis reached 116 this season -- the only guy to top 100 for as long as the league has been tallying play-by-play data.Most unassisted dunks Player Season Dunks Giannis Antetokounmpo 2018-19 116 Dwight Howard 2006-07 95 Shaquille O'Neal 2004-05 93 Since 1996-97 But Giannis plays a completely different game than those other two supermen.He handles the ball, he faces up, he drives.Those guys played in the low post."I think the thing that's so unique and different about how Giannis is dominating in the paint is that lots of times he's starting with the ball outside the 3-point line -- and still finishing in the paint," Bucks head coach Mike Budenholzer said.And there's just something especially satisfying about an unassisted driving dunk.It's such a dramatic display of dominance.It's why in many of his best highlights, Giannis looks like a man among boys.But then you remember this is the best basketball league on Earth.Every NBA player would love to dribble up the court and slam it home at will.They can't.Yes, that unassisted dunk stat is a little esoteric, and it might not translate directly to wins, but it does reveal just how unprecedented this kid's dominance is right now.Coaches design entire defensive philosophies around protecting the paint.Antetokounmpo doesn't care.With only a dribble or two and some crafty footwork, he can transport the ball from the perimeter to the hoop and hammer it home.Basketball rarely looks so easy: By surrounding Antetokounmpo with a fleet of long-range shooters and stationing them on remote perimeter outposts, Budenholzer has unleashed the NBA's most dominant interior scorer."We have so much spacing," Antetokounmpo said."I've got stronger and I'm able to get in there, play through contact now, and go up and finish the play."In the NBA, stars aren't born, they're built, and Giannis has built himself in the weight room.All that extra strength is important.Remember this guy?Yeah, he's not creating 100 dunks at the NBA level.But this guy is: Spacing starts at the rim, and Milwaukee's ferocious interior minister is the most critical component of the most prolific 3-point offense in the Eastern Conference.Between Giannis' physical development, his accelerated skills and Budenholzer's offensive architecture, the Bucks went from 27th overall in made 3-pointers in 2017-18 to second in 2018-19.Crucial playmaking Sometimes finishing the play means dunking on some fool's head, but other times it means doing this: "His ability as a passer and a playmaker has been so important to us," Budenholzer said."And he's already ahead of where any of us envisioned."He takes a lot of pride in being a playmaker."The passing highlights will never go as viral as the dunks, but they are more important.After creating only 8.4 assist opportunities per 100 possessions as a rookie, Antetokounmpo doubled that number this season (up to 17.0), per Second Spectrum tracking.He ranked fourth in the NBA in total 3-point assists.Even if he is not great at knocking them down himself, Antetokounmpo has found a way to create easy treys.Milwaukee led the league in assisted 3s this season, but no player assisted on more of them than Giannis.It wasn't close: Most assisted 3s | Milwaukee Bucks Giannis Antetokounmpo: 245 Eric Bledsoe: 166 Khris Middleton: 106 Although the step-back 3 is quickly rising in popularity, more than 82 percent of NBA 3s are still assisted.The secret to increasing 3-point offense is finding players and actions that can generate clean looks on the perimeter.Giannis is one of those players, and Budenholzer's playbook is chock-full of those actions, but the front office helped too.Editor's Picks The stars, storylines and showdowns you need to know for the NBA playoffs The Eastern Conference will crown a new king.The champs have worthy challengers.A new postseason has arrived, and here's everything you need to get ready.NBA mock draft: Projecting all 60 picks before a big lottery Here are our new projections for both rounds, including a lottery shake-up.1 Related The offseason addition of Brook Lopez was a stroke of genius.Last season, John Henson was the Bucks' starting center.Henson can't space the floor.He doesn't shoot 3s.Lopez came in and immediately became the team's most prolific deep threat.Opponents have to station a big man out on the perimeter even when Lopez doesn't fire away; "Splash Mountain" has opened up the interior, helping Giannis become more efficient than ever."[Lopez] has done a lot, because his man is not in the paint," Antetokounmpo said."One thing that I tell Brook every time when the game is starting is, 'Shoot the ball.Doesn't matter if it goes in.Shoot the ball.'Because I know the guy will have to come out and guard him."Antetokounmpo wouldn't look this good without Budenholzer's offense or his friends on the perimeter, but organizational competence shouldn't hurt his best player case.His main competitor for the MVP award, James Harden, also benefits from the strategic alignment of front office, head coach and superstar.The best organizations in the league always have embraced some kind of fitting structure, and the most successful ones put their best players in conducive habitats, just as general manager Jon Horst and Budenholzer have done with Giannis.Regardless, Giannis is probably not the absolute best offensive player in the league -- at least not yet.But he doesn't have to be.The Bucks' offensive improvements have been remarkable -- they ended the regular season with the best offense in the East -- but as crazy as it sounds, that pales in comparison to Milwaukee's defensive awakening.Dylan Buell/Getty Images Great defense and how to value it There was always a defensive juggernaut buried in this roster.For years, the Bucks have had a reputation as one the longest, most athletic rosters in the NBA.But previous coaches just couldn't crack the code.Last season, the Bucks ranked 18th in defensive efficiency.This season, they ranked first, and many of their NBA-best 60 victories have more to do with getting stops than they do with getting buckets.The entire culture around the team has changed.That's most evident on defense.Budenholzer redesigned the defensive playbook.Whereas last season's team was overaggressive at the point of attack and gave up more layups than anyone, this season's team is the opposite.The Bucks run arguably the most conservative pick-and-roll defense, happy to keep their big men in the paint and give up perimeter looks as long as they protect the rim.2019 NBA draft Get ready for Zion Williamson, Ja Morant and more.Latest NBA mock draft Top 100 draft rankings Draft assets for every team Rankings by stats and scouting Giannis is the best defender on the team and arguably the most versatile defender in the league.He can protect the hoop.He can guard on the perimeter.He is a nightmare in transition.His ridiculous mix of size, athleticism and length essentially enables the Bucks to have an extra big man on the floor at all times without getting slower.Forget MVP for a second.You could argue Giannis should win the Defensive Player of the Year Award too.I'll make his case right here with four quick stats.Stat No.1: Of the 216 players (almost half the league) who have defended at least 100 shots at the rim, nobody has been a more effective rim protector than Giannis.Per Second Spectrum tracking, opponents convert just 52.7 percent of their shots at the rim when Giannis is the closest defender.Jayson Tatum knows.Stat No.2: Antetokounmpo ranks second in the NBA in defensive rebounding.Stat No.3: Of the 206 players who have played at least 50 games and averaged at least 20 minutes per game, Giannis has the third best defensive rating -- and the highest such mark on the team with the best defense.Stat No.4: Antetokounmpo and Robert Covington are the only wing players in the top 20 in ESPN's defensive real plus minus.When Antetokounmpo isn't making plays as a primary defender, he is a terrifying free safety.Out of 78 players who have provided help defense on at least 300 drives this season, he has been the best, holding opponents to a measly 0.82 points per chance, according to Second Spectrum data.And when teams are silly enough to isolate against him, he has been fifth best at stifling that nonsense -- among 135 players to defend at least 100 such plays -- allowing just 0.74 points per chance.The numbers are impressive, but the footage is even better.Giannis has the NBA's best defensive highlights.Just ask Blake Griffin.Imagine a defender as punishing as Rudy Gobert and an offensive star nearly as dominant as Harden.That's Giannis.Still, defense remains woefully underappreciated in player valuation.Not only is it hard to measure, but it's boring.Whenever a decent scorer is also a strong defender, he is labeled a good "two-way player."But here's the thing: This isn't football.Everybody is a two-way player in this sport, and its best players excel on both ends of the court.For years, we didn't have enough data to even try to quantitatively value individual defensive performances.In turn, even the most sophisticated MVP debates -- Giannis vs. Harden, Russell Westbrook vs. Kawhi Leonard, you name it -- can overlook the unglamorous arts of stopping dudes.We still have a long way to go.Basketball has borrowed a lot from baseball, including an attempt to measure and catalog every statistical event.NBA defense isn't event-based, and defensive play involves constantly doing stuff that is hard to tally in spreadsheets.The best defenders in the sport are constantly suppressing shots, intimidating opponents, stifling sets and disrupting offenses in ways that are inconvenient (or impossible) to count.Basketball also has modeled its most prestigious individual award after America's pastime.Major League Baseball introduced the most valuable player award in 1931, decades before basketball did.Trying to identify and award the best player in a sport at the end of the season isn't unusual.However, those first two words -- most valuable -- make things weirder than going with best player or most outstanding or whatever.That's how we end up in unanswerable debates.No one will totally agree on what is valuable in the game of basketball.While the analytics era of the NBA has helped us quantify value in dozens of new ways, our accounting framework and discourse still remain skewed toward offensive numbers.It's within this environment that terrible defensive players still get paid millions of dollars.It's within this framework that the stank of superstars on the defensive end gets obscured by buckets.This season's MVP vote will probably be close.But the league's best team has a superstar who is clearly the best two-way player in the world's best two-way sport.What is more valuable than that?
The anxious undercurrent of these NBA playoffs:::::THESE ARE GOING to be anxious playoffs.There are stresses within the high-stakes games naturally, but there's also another layer that is perhaps unique to this season.It's the pressure of the aftermath and it will mount by the day, by the loss and, oddly in this unusual season, even by the win in some cases.With so many contenders loaded with fragile big-name free agents and other concerns that are tied to the uncertainty of their finishes, there is more at stake than just winning.There's also the future and, in these times, that's always on the mind.This applies across the board in the Eastern Conference, where it's accentuated because you could make a legitimate case that any of the top four seeds could/should reach the NBA Finals.And all of them have ancillary issues that bubble under the surface.2019 NBA Playoffs Find everything you need to know about the opening round of the playoffs here.NBA playoffs mega-preview Schedules, matchups and more The Toronto Raptors have lived all season with the Kawhi Leonard cloud on the horizon.Leonard hasn't articulated, well, almost anything.But certainly not what will be most important to him when he has the option to become a free agent this summer.But it's a safe bet that an early exit would not bode well for the Raptors' chances at re-signing him, especially after they changed coaches and retooled the roster to try to bury past playoff disappointments.The Boston Celtics have been one of the most maddening teams in the league.In some weeks they appear to have the firepower and togetherness to beat anyone.Other times, their chemistry is absent.They have lived on Kyrie Irving's yo-yo for months.Even if you give him a pass and write off his promise to re-sign in October as an emotional utterance while in a festive mood at a fan event, his choice to make a Nike commercial in which he announced a hope to raise his number to the rafters sure seemed more secure.And it isn't just his free agency, it's the hot and cold support for his teammates and head coach that have been perhaps even more trying.Boston has all the ingredients of a team that could make the Finals, especially when bigs Al Horford and Aron Baynes are healthy and Jayson Tatum finds a balance between grace and aggression.But if it goes south, it's possible the Celtics could not only lose Irving in July but also be more judicious in an expected trade offer for Anthony Davis in the summer.There's a wide swing of possibilities here that bears watching as the Celtics make their way through the playoffs.Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant's upcoming free agency has added another level of intrigue to the playoffs.Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images The Milwaukee Bucks have the best record and their best player, Giannis Antetokounmpo, is under contract.But there's still fallout possibility there.Even after extending Eric Bledsoe with a four-year deal last month, the Bucks have important free agents -- Khris Middleton, Malcolm Brogdon, Brook Lopez and Nikola Mirotic -- to deal with.Keeping this 60-win team together may hinge on these playoffs.Bringing the core back would likely send the Bucks into the luxury tax next season and beyond.The Bucks haven't paid the luxury tax since 2003, the season they traded Ray Allen for Gary Payton.Is this team close enough to title contention to break that taxless streak or will they retrofit with cheaper options if there's an earlier-than-expected exit?And how might that crossroads affect Antetokounmpo, who can extend his contract if he wants in 2020?These are topics that are absolutely being discussed within the organization as they start their most promising postseason in decades.The free-agency questions are just as big for the Philadelphia 76ers.They made a series of trades to take a huge swing this season.Their big-name starting five has been darn impressive when they've played together, which hasn't been that often unfortunately.But three-fifths of those starters -- Jimmy Butler, Tobias Harris and JJ Redick -- are free agents and another, Ben Simmons, is due an extension later this year.Paying them all top market rates might cost the 76ers a sum approaching $500 million.Can ownership possibly stomach that sort of outlay for a group that isn't seriously in line to compete for a title?It's a big question and the answer may reveal itself in the next few weeks.Frankly, it has to.Once you take all that in, consider that two of these East teams won't even reach the conference finals.These entire playoffs is a multi-tiered pressure cooker ripe for anxiety.Now breathe.That's just the East.The two-time defending champion Golden State Warriors have two All-Stars headed to free agency.However, because this is the postseason of jitters, it's not as simple as win again and everyone is happy, healthy and re-signing.Kevin Durant has exuded unhappiness throughout the season for reasons only he can understand, giving rise to the belief that he's playing his last days with the team.If two titles didn't make him happy, will a third only verify his tug toward a new challenge?Is this what New York Knicks fans or anyone who wants the Warriors dynasty disbanded should be rooting for?Or perhaps if the Warriors are somehow upset, will that disappointment keep Durant in place as redemption becomes a motivating draw?If you can figure out Durant, send your resume to both the Warriors and Knicks as they are probably interested in hiring you.Either way, their playoff run is carrying some extra baggage.Then there's the LA Clippers, who have managed to construct an exciting and competitive team while low-key plotting to eviscerate their competition in the free-agent market chasing two megastars.They already have vastly improved their Q-rating within the league in Steve Ballmer's ownership tenure and built an infrastructure they hope not only makes them attractive to free agents but more attractive than their historic big brother, the Los Angeles Lakers.Their playoff tenure will play some sort of role in what happens in July, even if it's just the threat of an upset.This weekend the games start.But the game-within-game for future control of the league is where the real action may be.Very little is clear, even to the people who have the most power in the situation.With roughly a third of the league scheduled to be free agents, this has been a situation that has been developing for some time.There's a lot of choppy waters between now and resolution.DWYANE WADE WILL be remembered for many things in Miami, from his fearless style of play to his tremendous shot blocking to the magical 2006 NBA Finals to his involvement in the community.But one underrated aspect of his career that has been an unending gift to the Heat organization is his willingness to sacrifice.At times it has been money, yes.Wade twice took pay cuts to help the Heat build their roster.Once in 2010 to put role players around LeBron James and Chris Bosh.And again in 2014 after James left so the Heat could remain competitive by being aggressive in the free-agent market.But there have been other ways that involved more than money.In 2008, Pat Riley approached Wade with a plan to create cap room for the 2010 free-agent bonanza.This meant trading the team's second-best player at the time, Shawn Marion, to better align their books to have cap space that summer.Editor's Picks Thank you, Dwyane Wade Dwyane Wade had grace and guts and changed the sports landscape in South Florida and beyond, writes Dan Le Batard.Miami's hottest postgame spot?The D-Wade jersey swap Dwyane Wade's nightly ritual quickly took on a life of its own during the future Hall of Famer's "One Last Dance."1 Related They'd been building the team up following a rebuild after the title and put the advancement on hold for the mere hope they could land the big fish.It was an ask for Wade to hand away a chunk of his prime and even though he'd already won a title, it was not an easy decision.Wade got impatient with the slow process and quarreled with Riley a bit, but he ultimately signed off and was his wingman in landing James and Bosh.Then once James was in the fold, it was Wade who came to his teammate in their second season together and encouraged him to take the reins and become the primary playmaker.They'd tried to share the role, trading off turns, and it didn't work.The Heat didn't fully bloom into a superteam until Wade, still very much at the peak of his powers, took a willing step backward.There were more moments along these lines.Such as in the 2008 Olympics when Wade agreed to be a bench player to better balance Team USA's rotation, unlocking a fierce lineup that took the gold.All the way to this season, when he agreed to come off the bench in his farewell tour even though he probably had the juice left to start.Sacrifice is a big part of Wade's legacy.Staying in character, it's something he's barely ever mentioned.THERE'S A MINI lottery on Friday at the NBA's Board of Governors involving the Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies and New Orleans Pelicans.All three had 33-49 records, tied for seventh-worst.To determine the draft order for picks seven, eight and nine there is a random drawing, though all the teams will have the same odds to win the draft lottery on May 14.The Hoop Collective Podcast Brian Windhorst, Jackie MacMullan and Tim MacMahon discuss Magic Johnson's resignation and more.Listen now!The outcome has further implications.The Grizzlies will send their pick to the Celtics if it finishes outside the top eight.If the Grizzlies "lose" the draw and fall to No.9, they are likely to send their pick.If they "win" it becomes likely they will keep it.Memphis has indicated it wants to send the pick to Boston this year because next season the pick is just top 6 protected and then its fully unprotected in 2021.With the Grizzlies firing their coach, restructuring their front office and still mulling plans to trade Michael Conley, they may be flirting with that top 6 pick next season.Meanwhile, the Celtics would prefer not to get the pick this season.With three other first rounders including the Sacramento Kings' lottery pick, Boston would rather roll over the asset into the future.Then again, if Memphis scores in the draft lottery and moves to the top 4 picks all of this is moot and they keep the pick.In that case, one assumes they will be happy to keep it.
The stars, storylines and showdowns you need to know for the NBA playoffs:::::Playoff basketball is back!It has been a long regular season (177 days, to be exact), but the postseason has arrived, and it looks a lot different than it did a year ago.For the first time since 2010, a team not led by LeBron James will emerge from the Eastern Conference, and for the first time since 2005, James will not be involved in the festivities.As for the players, teams and matchups to know, well, we've got you covered.Jump to a series: West: Warriors-Clippers | Nuggets-Spurs Blazers-Thunder | Rockets-Jazz East: Bucks-Pistons | Raptors-Magic 76ers-Nets | Celtics-Pacers 2019 NBA playoffs: Matchups, schedules, news and more 2018-19 record: 57-25 BPI odds vs. LAC: 89 percent Warriors Playoff Tickets There were a lot of emotional highs and lows, but through it all, this group continued to churn out wins and locked up the top spot in the West.The process of trying to get up for most games in the regular season was emotionally draining, but the Warriors held to the belief that they'd be ready when it counted most.The push for a three-peat has begun.Season in a single game: Jan. 15 The Warriors came into a showdown against Denver hearing some chatter that the Nuggets were ready to give them a push in the Western Conference.OK. Klay Thompson & Co. proceeded to score a league-record 51 first-quarter points and demolish an overwhelmed Nuggets team.The game offered a reminder to the rest of the league that the Warriors are still better than anyone else when they want to focus and play at their peak.There's trouble brewing: The Warriors are confident that nobody can beat them if they stay healthy and play together.A potential Oklahoma City first-round series would have been interesting, given Kevin Durant's history with his former team, but the only team that would give the Warriors much pause in the West is the Rockets, especially if Chris Paul can stay healthy.But with home-court advantage at Oracle and the motivation of chasing history, the only thing that truly concerns the Warriors is the possibility of a star injury.Most 20-Point Losses By An NBA Champ Season Team 20-pt losses 1974-75 Warriors 6 1960-61 Celtics 5 2016-17 Warriors 5 1977-78 Bullets 5 Source: Elias Sports Bureau One big stat and why it matters: Has the regular season become too boring, or does Golden State have some issues that might pop up late in the playoffs?The Warriors' point differential of plus-6.6 at home this season was their worst under Steve Kerr (since 2014-15), and it's a far cry from their plus-16.0 point differential two seasons ago.The Warriors also suffered eight 20-point losses this season, which becomes important when you realize that no NBA champion has suffered more than six during a title run.Get to know: Quinn Cook Cook is the Warriors' secret offensive weapon off the bench.The diminutive point guard has found his stride the past few weeks, going 48-for-78 in his past 10 games.He is shooting the ball with confidence while providing Kerr a solid option off the bench.Cook has the ability to be a difference-maker in short bursts.What to watch in Round 1: DeMarcus Cousins vs. Montrezl Harrell.This marks the first playoff series for Cousins, and he will oppose Harrell, an active big man who will try to move him around.Cousins' teammates and coaches have been looking forward to seeing how he would perform on this stage; he'll have a chance to spread the floor when needed and bang down on the blocks against the Clippers.Cousins has played against the Clippers three times this season, which is impressive given he has played only 30 games total since returning in mid-January from an Achilles injury that kept him out for almost a year.In those three games, Cousins averaged 13.0 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.5 assists.-- Nick Friedell 2018-19 record: 48-34 BPI odds vs. GS: 11 percent Clippers Playoff Tickets No team in the league has existed in a greater state of flux the past two seasons than the Clippers, yet here they are -- improbably -- in the NBA playoffs.A far cry from the perennial Lob City squads, this Clippers team is a collection of lunch-pail journeymen and young prospects, many of whom didn't arrive until the trade deadline, when the Clippers dealt away Tobias Harris.Rather than close up shop and ready themselves for a busy offseason after losing one of their most productive players, the Clippers caught fire and secured themselves a playoff berth as the ultimate energy team.Season in a single game: Feb. 9 Three days after trading Harris and playing with two new starters who had yet to step foot in the team's training facility in Los Angeles, the Clippers found themselves down 28 points in the second quarter in Boston and trailed by 21 at the half.After intermission, the Clippers held the Celtics to a 12-point third quarter before exploding for 42 points in the final frame.Rookie Landry Shamet, acquired from Philadelphia as part of the package for Harris, drained four 3-pointers in his Clippers debut."We broke out the JJ Redick package with him," said Doc Rivers, referencing his old shooting guard in praise of his new one.Why they're dangerous: By nearly every projection, the Clippers shouldn't be playing playoff basketball, which means they have nothing to lose.Lou Williams believes he can score against anybody.Montrezl Harrell plays with reckless abandon, big moment be damned.And there isn't a shot from distance that Danilo Gallinari doesn't think he can drain.The kids -- Shamet, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Ivica Zubac?They're too young to know any better and are propelled by the confidence earned during the Clippers' sizzling post-All-Star-break run.Best plus/minus in clutch time (2018-19) TEAM Clutch +/- LA Clippers +65 Denver Nuggets +55 Philadelphia 76ers +43 Toronto Raptors +41 One big stat and why it matters: The Clippers have been arguably the best team in the NBA at closing out tight games.They have a plus-65 plus/minus in clutch time this season, first in the league.Lou Williams' play is a huge reason.His plus-92 plus/minus in clutch time ranks first in the NBA among individual players.The next-best individual plus/minus in clutch time this season belongs to Denver's Nikola Jokic, at plus-89.Get to know: Montrezl Harrell A second-rounder made good, Harrell is more than a mere energy guy who buzzes around the floor.He might not start for the Clippers but is a good bet to play crucial minutes.The Clippers' backup big man has serious skills as Lou Williams' dance partner in one of the most effective pick-and-roll attacks in the league, and he is an efficiency machine with a nose for the rim.Among players who log more than 24 minutes per night, Harrell ranks second to Giannis Antetokounmpo in true shooting percentage.What to watch in Round 1: Gilgeous-Alexander has enjoyed a superb rookie campaign and has shown flashes of the lanky, defensive presence at the top of the floor that he projects to be.Now comes his graduate exam: Stephen Curry.Veteran Patrick Beverley will spend much of his time hounding Curry, but the Clippers' 20-year-old point guard will get a prime opportunity to use his length and agility against the Warriors' ballet in preparation for a day when the ask is more reasonable and the Clippers find themselves in a high-stakes series.Depending on how the Clippers fare this summer, that could be sooner than later.-- Kevin Arnovitz 2018-19 record: 54-28 BPI odds vs. SA: 71 percent Nuggets Playoff Tickets There are times when a team ends a season in disappointment but on an upward tilt that leads to expectation the next season that is difficult to meet.Well, the Nuggets didn't just meet that expectation.They jumped in a jet and zoomed past.Nikola Jokic blossomed into an All-NBA star, and the mix of role players and emerging talent has led to an excellent team.The Nuggets play defense, move the ball and have terrific chemistry.But as it goes for any young team, it's unknown how they will look in the pressure cooker of the postseason.Season in a single game: Jan. 13 It's a sequence of games for the Nuggets that tells the story.In this mid-January game, they beat the Blazers 116-113 in a thriller, with Jokic going for 40-10-8 and playing a brilliant fourth quarter.He even heard a thundering chant of M-V-P while shooting free throws.The win elevated the Nuggets to the top of the West, a half-game up on the Warriors.Two nights after the win, the Nuggets took on the Warriors in Denver, a litmus test for the emerging squad.The Warriors dropped 51 in the first quarter and went on to smash the young Nuggets 142-111.It's an example of where things stand for them: They are building, growing and developing into a true Western contender.But against the class of the NBA, they were shown that there's still a ways to go.There's trouble brewing: The Nuggets' primary weakness, if it's fair to call it that, is their inexperience.They are young and have yet to feel playoff fire as a group.As a high seed in the West, they'll be favored in their opening-round series and have the pressure of defending home court in their first two games.They've responded all season and handled themselves with impressive maturity, but if teams double Jokic, can Jamal Murray make the right read?Can Gary Harris create his own shot in a critical scenario?Can all their overachieving role players -- Torrey Craig, Monte Morris -- keep hitting shots?Most Passes Per Game to Teammate (2018-19) TEAM DUO Passes per game Nuggets Jokic-to-Murray 30.0 Grizzlies Gasol-to-Conley 26.7 Pistons Jackson-to-Griffin 26.3 Hawks Collins-to-Young 25.5 Nuggets Murray-to-Jokic 24.8 Source: Second Spectrum One big stat and why it matters: When Jokic and Murray share the court -- and the ball -- good things happen for Denver.The duo ranks first and fifth, respectively, in the NBA in passes to each other per game.Jokic finds Murray more than 30 times per game, and Murray gets it to Jokic nearly 25 times per game.Get to know: Malik Beasley and Torrey Craig What has made the Nuggets so good this season is that there are three or four candidates who fit the mold of unknown player who could make a name for himself.The Nuggets' depth has been a strength, but head coach Mike Malone will have to focus on the eight or nine guys he trusts most.Beasley and Craig have both taken turns as game-changing wing, and it's hard to predict which one Malone might lean on more.What to watch in Round 1: Derrick White vs. Jamal Murray.White has emerged as one of the better defensive guards in the NBA, and Murray will have considerable pressure and responsibility on his shoulders.So many playoff games can be decided by a big shot or two in the closing minutes, and the Nuggets will rely on Murray to create some on his own.White is long, rangy and athletic; he could give Murray some trouble getting clean looks.-- Royce Young 2018-19 record: 48-34 BPI odds vs. DEN: 29 percent Spurs Playoff Tickets San Antonio opened camp without a member of the franchise's famed Big Three of Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili and Tony Parker on the roster for the first time since the 1997-98 season, thus ushering in a new era of Spurs basketball.Despite a rash of early injuries and the hiccups of incorporating DeMar DeRozan and three other new starters, San Antonio scrapped its way to an NBA-record-tying 22nd straight postseason appearance.Season in a single game: Dec. 15 Even battier than the winged mammals that swoop to the AT&T Center floor from time to time is San Antonio's inability to close games.A Dec. 15 loss at home to the Bulls, in which the Spurs blew a 21-point lead in the second half, made it clear that this is no longer the San Antonio squad known for out-executing less experienced opponents down the stretch.Even internally, the Spurs admit that they can no longer rely on their "corporate knowledge" in the clutch situations that they once relished.Why they're dangerous: The Spurs beat all but one of the top teams in the West (Houston) more than once during the regular season, and their jelling process took much more time than usual because they had to strip down many of the complexities of the defensive system to accommodate all the new faces in the lineups.While many teams discuss the desire to play their best ball once the postseason rolls around, San Antonio might actually be trending that way.For several years, the Spurs enjoyed the luxury of resting players as the playoffs approached.But with a younger, less experienced roster, San Antonio had to scrap its way in, which in some ways could lead to a more battle-tested squad for the postseason.One big stat and why it matters: The Spurs might be better on defense with their two most recognizable stars on the sideline.When LaMarcus Aldridge and DeRozan are on the court together (2,242 minutes), the Spurs have a defensive rating of 109.7, which would rank 17th in the league this season.When Aldridge and DeRozan are both off the court (828 minutes), the Spurs have a defensive rating of 102.5, which would rank first in the league this season.Get to know: Derrick White White, who spent almost all of his rookie season in the G League, was forced into the starting lineup by Dejounte Murray's preseason knee injury.He has emerged as an essential part of the Spurs' success.He's an All-Defensive Team candidate who ranked second on the team in net rating (plus-4.3 points per 100 possessions).What to watch in Round 1: LaMarcus Aldridge vs. Paul Millsap.The Nuggets can't ask Jokic to guard the Spurs' go-to guy, so that task falls primarily to Millsap, despite the 3-inch height disadvantage.Aldridge averaged 22.3 points on 55.7 percent shooting for the Spurs against the Nuggets this season.San Antonio was 37-10 when Aldridge scored at least 20 points, including 2-1 against the Nuggets.If the Spurs' All-Star is in a rhythm, it has a real chance to pull off an upset over an inexperienced No.2 seed.-- Michael C. Wright and Tim MacMahon 2018-19 record: 53-29 BPI odds vs. OKC: 57 percent Trail Blazers Playoff Tickets Shaking off a fluky sweep at the hands of the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of last year's playoffs, the Blazers started 10-3 and navigated a tricky February schedule to stay in the Western Conference's second tier.Despite the crushing blow of losing starting center Jusuf Nurkic to a compound leg fracture on March 25, Portland took care of business against a weak schedule to earn home-court advantage in the first round.Season in a single game: March 18 The Blazers were undone during last year's playoffs by two things: the Pelicans getting hot at the right time and the inability of players besides All-Star Damian Lillard and backcourt mate CJ McCollum to make a play when New Orleans trapped the duo.Playing without McCollum (left knee injury) in this game, Lillard showed his development as a playmaker, and his teammates showed their improved reliability in a comeback win against the feisty Pacers.In addition to scoring 30 points, Lillard handed out a season-high 15 assists, and six Portland players scored in double figures.There's trouble brewing: With 18 points, Nurkic was the Blazers' second-leading scorer in that March 18 game, part of the best season of his career.A week later, he lay on the Moda Center floor in agony after breaking two bones in his left leg in a freak accident.While the Blazers stayed afloat against lesser competition without Nurkic, it will be difficult for them to replace his playmaking when opponents trap Lillard and his rim protection against playoff competition.Add McCollum coming back from injury, and Portland, healthy most of the year, is at far less than full strength for the postseason.Most points per direct pick (2018-19) Team Ball handler Screener Pts/Pick POR Damian Lillard Zach Collins 1.22 MEM Mike Conley Joakim Noah 1.19 MIL Eric Bledsoe Brook Lopez 1.17 Source: Second Spectrum One big stat and why it matters: Lillard is one of the most lethal pick-and-roll ball handlers in the NBA.According to Second Spectrum, the Trail Blazers average 1.11 points per direct pick when Lillard is the ball handler, highest in the NBA among 173 players to receive at least 150 direct picks.Lillard has had success in the pick-and-roll with Zach Collins, one of the players who will attempt to fill the void left by Nurkic.The Blazers average 1.25 points per direct pick with Lillard as the ball handler and Collins as the screener, best in the NBA (min.150 direct picks).Get to know: Zach Collins Collins, in and out of the rotation after the Kanter signing, was thrust into a larger role by Nurkic's untimely injury.Now Portland's best rim protector, as well as a floor-spacing option at the 5 spot (he's a 33 percent 3-point shooter), Collins will likely finish games at center.What to watch in Round 1: Damian Lillard vs. Russell Westbrook.Oklahoma City rarely sent two defenders at Lillard in the pick-and-roll -- just 7.5 percent of the time, per Second Spectrum tracking -- allowing him to play scorer in the season series.Lillard's 34.8 points per game were his most against any West opponent.Yet the Thunder swept the four matchups, in part because Westbrook was able to score efficiently against the Blazers.Thanks largely to 9.3 free throw attempts per game, Westbrook's .530 true shooting percentage vs. Portland was far better than his overall .500 mark.-- Kevin Pelton 2018-19 record: 49-33 BPI odds vs. POR: 43 percent Thunder Playoff Tickets For a minute there, the Thunder didn't just look like a good team -- they looked like an actual title contender.But as it seems to go with them, the inconsistencies caught up, and the roller coaster started.It's hard to project anything when it comes to OKC because the team's variance can be so extreme.The Thunder might be a real playoff threat in the West, and they have the DNA of a dangerous team.They also could be a first-round out.Neither result would surprise anyone.Season in a single game: Feb. 14 At the time, it felt like a harmless loss.It was the night before the All-Star break, and the Thunder were riding a four-game winning streak and had won 12 of their past 13.They were establishing themselves as a top Western contender, with impressive recent wins over Philly, Portland (twice), Milwaukee and Houston.They rolled into New Orleans, and despite Anthony Davis' leaving the game -- and the arena -- with an injury in the first half, OKC gave up 65 points by halftime, never course-corrected and lost 131-122, despite 44 points from Russell Westbrook.It was foreshadowing of the rocky second half to come, with sloppy defense, bad shooting and inconsistent, lethargic performances mixed with inspired, solid wins.Why they're dangerous: It's a pretty straightforward thing with the Thunder: PG and Russ.That kind of combo can score 75 combined on their own and completely take over a series.Against top teams, the Thunder had one of the best records in the NBA this season, and so much of that was because George and Westbrook elevated in those big games.There are some concerns with George's health after he missed the final game of the season with shoulder soreness, but at full tilt, the Thunder can be fast and furious, with Westbrook and George roaring at you relentlessly.Most deflections this season PLAYER Deflections Paul George 292 James Harden 277 Thaddeus Young 263 Marcus Smart 227 Russell Westbrook 226 Source: NBA.com/stats Most loose ball recoveries this season PLAYER Recoveries Paul George 160 Bradley Beal 139 Ben Simmons 135 Russell Westbrook 134 Kemba Walker 133 Source: NBA.com/stats One big stat and why it matters: If the Thunder are to make a deep run in the postseason, it will come down to Westbrook and George, two of the best hustle players in the NBA.According to NBA.com/stats, George leads the NBA in deflections and loose ball recoveries, and Westbrook ranks in the top five in both categories.Get to know: Jerami Grant Paul George called him the Thunder's X factor, and it's hard to disagree because Grant is integral to the Thunder's success.His 3-point shooting has been a significant development (39.2 percent), and his electric athleticism and elastic versatility allow him to play in a ton of lineup combinations.If the Thunder advance, it'll probably be because Grant played well in the series.What to watch in Round 1: OKC vs. Enes Kanter.If anyone knows how to attack Kanter, it's the Thunder.Coach Billy Donovan was caught saying "Can't play Kanter" on the bench during the Thunder's series against the Rockets in 2017.Without Jusuf Nurkic, the Thunder appear to have a sizable advantage on the interior and could put Terry Stotts and the Blazers in a bind with lineups.Plus, fellow former 'Stache Brother Steven Adams seems to have Kanter's number.-- Young 2018-19 record: 53-29 BPI odds vs. UTA: 56 percent Rockets Playoff Tickets It took almost two months for the Rockets to get over their hangover from coming thisclose in last year's West finals.After digging a hole with an 11-14 start, Houston rode James Harden's historic offensive dominance back into the upper crust of the Western Conference, despite Chris Paul and Clint Capela missing extended time due to injuries.Along the way, GM Daryl Morey dumped some offseason mistakes (Carmelo Anthony, Michael Carter-Williams) and added some quality role players (Austin Rivers, Kenneth Faried, Iman Shumpert) to improve the Rockets' depth.Season in a single game: Jan. 3 The signature moment of the Rockets' season -- and the Beard's campaign to repeat as MVP -- happened in the final seconds of Houston's Jan. 3 overtime win over the Warriors at Oracle Arena.With Klay Thompson contesting from the left and Draymond Green closing out, Harden launched his 23rd 3-point attempt of the night, drilling a game-winning pullup from 28 feet.That was the exclamation point on a 44-point, 10-rebound, 15-assist performance, a ridiculous stat line that somehow didn't seem too far beyond the norm for Harden during his historic run.Message sent: Harden gives Houston a chance to beat anyone anywhere.There's trouble brewing: Can Paul stay healthy throughout a deep playoff run?Can Harden maintain his efficiency after a full season with a historically heavy workload?Paul, who will turn 34 during the conference semifinals, has had his postseasons ended prematurely due to injuries in two of the past three years.Rockets fans need no reminder of the hamstring strain he suffered in the last minute of Houston's series-lead-taking Game 5 win in last year's West finals.Harden's reputation for fading in the playoffs is an exaggeration based on a couple awful elimination games.However, his 3-point shooting, such a vital element of his scoring, bears watching.He has shot sub-30 percent from deep the past two postseasons, perhaps a sign of tired legs.Most unassisted 3s in a season (NBA history) Season Player Unassisted 3s 2018-19 James Harden 317 2017-18 James Harden 196 2016-17 James Harden 179 2015-16 Stephen Curry 177 2018-19 Kemba Walker 146 One big stat and why it matters: This season, Harden pushed the bounds of how much offense one player can create, blending volume and efficiency at a level that only Wilt Chamberlain has ever attained.Harden made 317 unassisted 3-pointers, obliterating his own NBA record set last season and more than doubling the output of any other player in 2018-19.Get to know: Danuel House Jr.There's good reason Morey eventually blinked in the contract standoff with House, who was relegated to the G League when he reached his allotment of NBA service days on his two-way deal and refused the Rockets' offer of a three-year minimum contract.The 6-foot-7 forward gives Houston athleticism and has become a knockdown spot-up shooter (41.6 percent from 3), making him an excellent complementary piece.He has a net rating of plus-14.0 points per 100 possessions in 14 games since the Rockets signed him for the rest of the season.What to watch in Round 1: Clint Capela vs. Rudy Gobert.Gobert, who will likely be the Defensive Player of the Year for the second consecutive season, has to be a dominant deterrent on Harden's drives for the Jazz to contain Houston's historically elite offense.Capela makes that task even more difficult as a lob threat who has an uncanny chemistry with Harden, who excels at the last-split-second dish for Capela to finish.-- MacMahon 2018-19 record: 50-32 BPI odds vs. HOU: 44 percent Jazz Playoff Tickets Just as they did last season, the Jazz started slowly and finished strong.Utah sat second-to-last in the Western Conference standings a couple of months into the season, after stumbling to a 14-17 record through a road-heavy early stretch of the schedule.Since the Jazz got in a groove, however, they've played at an elite level.The NBA-best Bucks are the only team with a better win percentage than the Jazz since Jan. 1.Season in a single game: Jan. 9 How fitting is it that you can point to a massive comeback as the turning point in the Jazz's season?Utah overcame a 21-point deficit to roll to a 106-93 win over the Magic on Jan. 9.The victory pulled the Jazz's record to 21-21 and jump-started a six-game winning streak.The Jazz rallied with two essential elements to playing to their peak potential: spectacular scoring by Donovan Mitchell (22 of 33 points in the second half, including 16 in the fourth quarter) and dominant defense (held the Magic to 30 points after halftime).Why they're dangerous: Good news: Utah went 18-6 after the All-Star break, which was the NBA's third-best record in that span.Bad news: The Rockets (20-5) had the league's best record after the break.But the Jazz are an elite defensive team with a star in Mitchell who has proved he's capable of winning a playoff series.Lowest FG% allowed at the rim (2018-19) PLAYER TEAM FG% allowed Derrick Favors UTAH 50.1 Hassan Whiteside MIA 50.7 Ivica Zubac LAL/LAC 51.5 JaVale McGee LAL 52.2 Brook Lopez MIL 52.6 Rudy Gobert UTAH 52.9 Serge Ibaka TOR 52.9 Source: Second Spectrum One big stat and why it matters: Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors play significant roles in Utah's interior defense.According to Second Spectrum, Favors leads the NBA in field goal percentage allowed at the rim, and Gobert ranks tied for sixth (min.250 attempts).Gobert has also defended the most shots at the rim this season.Get to know: Royce O'Neale The reserve swingman's path to the NBA included stints in Germany, Spain and Lithuania before he made the Jazz's roster at the start of last season.O'Neale has established himself as an essential role player: He's the epitome of a 3-and-D: O'Neale shoots 38.6 percent from long distance and, at 6-foot-6, 226 pounds, has the strength and versatility to guard multiple positions.What to watch in Round 1: Joe Ingles' jumper.The Jazz need Ingles to be a scoring threat to have a shot to beat the Rockets.It's not a coincidence that Ingles had a career night -- 27 points, 7-of-9 from 3-point range -- in Utah's lone win over the Rockets in last year's West semifinals.He averaged 14.5 points and shot 58.3 percent on 3s in the Jazz's two wins over the Rockets this season, compared to 8.0 points on 33 percent long-range shooting in Utah's two losses to Houston.-- MacMahon 2018-19 record: 60-22 BPI odds vs. DET: 94 percent Bucks Playoff Tickets Armed with a new head coach, a two-way superstar and an edict to shoot 3-pointers at will, the Bucks are no longer the cute story or the ones who got away.Giannis Antetokounmpo's metamorphosis from doe-eyed, gangly rookie to MVP front-runner has led the Bucks to a league-best record of 60-22.Still, Milwaukee has not escaped the first round of the playoffs since 2001.Season in a single game: March 17 Milwaukee has won a league-best 45 games by double figures -- by the way, every other team to pull that off won a title -- bu a close loss against an East rival best sums up its immediate future.Although Antetokounmpo scored a career-high 52 points, the Bucks fell to the 76ers 130-125.Joel Embiid's 40 points were supported by 66 from his fellow starters.The Bucks' non-Greek starters, on the other hand, combined for just 47 points.Antetokounmpo will continue to put up big numbers in the postseason as he did last year against the Celtics, but the Bucks' success hinges on the play of Khris Middleton, Eric Bledsoe, Brook Lopez and their deep bench.There's trouble brewing: The Bucks glided through the first few months of the season with only minor scrapes and bruises.Then Antetokounmpo's knee soreness began to irritate him, and a sprained ankle caused him to miss two games in March.Sterling Brown hurt his wrist.Malcolm Brogdon has been out since March 15 with a minor plantar fascia tear that is expected to sideline him until at least the second round.Nikola Mirotic fractured his thumb.Tony Snell sprained his ankle.The good news for Milwaukee is that every player except Donte DiVincenzo (out for the season with bilateral heel bursitis) will likely be healthy for the postseason.After aggravating a week-old ankle sprain on March 28, Antetokounmpo limped into the middle of a scrum of reporters and said, "As long as we stay healthy, we are going to be fine."Most unassisted dunks in a season (past 20 years) SEASON PLAYER Unassisted dunks 2018-19 G. Antetokounmpo 116 2006-07 Dwight Howard 95 2004-05 Shaquille O'Neal 93 One big stat and why it matters: Giannis has been a dominant force all season, recording 116 unassisted dunks in 2018-19, the most in a season the past 20 years.In fact, Giannis is the only player with at least 100 unassisted dunks in that span.This is one of the reasons Giannis is averaging 17.5 points in the paint per game this season, most by any player since Shaquille O'Neal in the early 2000s.Get to know: Brook Lopez The Bucks seemingly stumbled into a deal with the perfect center for their MVP contender.Lopez joined the Bucks on a one-year deal at below-market price.Since then, Lopez's lights-out 3-point shooting has caught the attention of the league.He routinely pulls up from near the logo and is shooting 36 percent from deep, which helps stretch the floor for Antetokounmpo.But in the playoffs, it will be Lopez's defense the Bucks will be calling on.As the Bucks face off against the likes of Al Horford, Marc Gasol and Joel Embiid, Lopez will play a crucial role manning the inside.Although he's a bit slow and clunky, Lopez is big and disciplined, and his paint presence often discourages ball handlers from driving.He doesn't need to win his matchup every night, thanks to Giannis, but he does need to continue delivering quality contributions on both sides of the ball, as he has all season.If he does, Lopez should be in line for a hefty raise in free agency.What to watch in Round 1: Positionless bigs.Blake Griffin hobbled to the end of the regular season, sitting out the final game with a sore knee.Antetokounmpo has battled knee soreness of his own but heads into the playoffs healthy and rested, sitting two of the Bucks' past three games.The Pistons' upset hopes hang on Griffin, who has struggled with injuries in recent postseasons and hasn't won a playoff series since 2015.In the teams' four meetings so far this season, Griffin averaged 24.3 points, 8.3 rebounds and 7 assists.The Bucks still won by an average of 15 points.-- Malika Andrews 2018-19 record: 41-41 BPI odds vs. MIL: 6 percent Pistons Playoff Tickets The 2018-19 Pistons are one of the streakiest teams in recent memory, putting together four winning streaks of at least four games and four losing streaks of at least four games.They alternated between just over and just under the .500 mark the entire season, unable to move far in either direction.The team's foundation is its two strong big men -- Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin -- but the team's streakiness is tied almost entirely to its hot-and-cold perimeter shooting.The Pistons are unlikely to beat the top-seeded Bucks in a series but have the ability to steal a game or two if the shooters are on.Season in a single game: March 3 The Pistons are built around Drummond and Griffin, one to control the paint and the other to provide dynamic offense, and they can be tough to handle when their perimeter players are on.This was epitomized in their March 3 overtime win over the Raptors, in which they clicked at every phase.Drummond notched as many rebounds and combined blocks/steals as Marc Gasol and Pascal Siakam combined, Griffin turned in 27 points on 21 shots, point guards Reggie Jackson and Ish Smith combined for 28 points and 12 assists, and shooters Wayne Ellington and Luke Kennard knocked down seven 3s on their way to 30 points.That was the Pistons firing on all cylinders.Why they're dangerous: It all comes down to the bigs.Drummond is huge, athletic and a vacuum on the glass, while Griffin -- if his sore left knee doesn't give him too much trouble -- is still springy enough and has a versatile face-up game that is difficult for many traditional fours to handle.The Pistons rely on their bigs to create mismatches that put their perimeter players in advantageous situations.Most points per direct handoff this season TEAM PTS PER Houston Rockets 1.06 Detroit Pistons 1.05 Philadelphia 76ers 1.05 Source: Second Spectrum One big stat and why it matters: The bread and butter of the Pistons' offense is the dribble handoff.According to Second Spectrum, Detroit averages 1.05 points per direct handoff, tied with the 76ers for second best in the NBA.Only the Rockets have a higher handoff efficiency than the Pistons.Get to know: Wayne Ellington The Pistons can win only if their shooters are knocking down shots, and the most consistent shooter on the team is Ellington.He was acquired by the Pistons midseason, and he ended the season by knocking down 39 percent from behind the arc to average 15.6 PPG and 3.5 3PG in his last 11 games.Drummond and Griffin should draw the defense and get Ellington some open looks, and if he knocks them down, the Pistons can steal a game or two.What to watch in Round 1: Blake vs. Giannis.The Pistons can compete only if Griffin stays healthy enough to win his fair share of one-on-one matchups.He has been aggressive in his four matchups with Antetokounmpo this season, taking 71 field goal attempts and dishing 28 assists in those games.Unfortunately, Antetokounmpo has forced him into horrible inefficiency, as he made only 42.3 percent of those shots and matched his assist numbers with 28 turnovers in those four games.-- Andre Snellings 2018-19 record: 58-24 BPI odds vs. ORL: 89 percent Raptors Playoff Tickets The combination of trading for Kawhi Leonard and archnemesis LeBron James leaving for the Western Conference had fans north of the border dreaming of a trip to the NBA Finals.Nothing that has happened since has led them to think otherwise, as Toronto has the league's second-best record even though Leonard and Kyle Lowry missed large chunks of the season.Season in a single game: Dec. 12 Yes, Leonard didn't play, but that's kind of the point.The Raptors have been almost as good when Leonard and Lowry don't play as when they do this season, and this night showed what they can look like at top gear, as they dismantled the Warriors -- who had their four All-Stars all playing.This win, combined with a victory over the Warriors in Toronto that completed the season sweep, will give the Raptors confidence that if they can make it to the Finals, they can make it a series.There's trouble brewing: All season, the Raptors have looked like two teams: one when Leonard has the ball and one when he doesn't.Some of that is because Leonard prefers to play a more deliberate, isolation style, while the Raptors ping the ball around more frequently when he isn't on the court.There have been only a handful of games all season in which the Raptors have had their full allotment of players available.If there is one weakness to point to heading into the playoffs, it is that lack of time to sort everything out.One big stat and why it matters: Don't let the Raptors get out and run, as they are the NBA's best team in transition.According to Second Spectrum, Toronto's 1.22 points per chance in transition leads all teams by a relatively wide margin.They take advantage of that often, as their 1,639 valid chances in transition ranks fifth in the league.Get to know: Pascal Siakam Siakam, who should be the clear winner of the NBA's Most Improved Player award, has not only improved across the board but also has helped keep the Raptors humming while having Lowry and Leonard missing time this season.He should be an All-Star next season and could be the player who puts Toronto over the top and gets the Raptors to their first NBA Finals.What to watch in Round 1: Aaron Gordon vs. Siakam.Frankly, there isn't a lot about this series that is exciting, but seeing two of the more athletic young forwards in the league go back-and-forth over the course of a best-of-seven series will provide at least one thing for neutral fans to lock on to.-- Tim Bontemps 2018-19 record: 42-40 BPI odds vs. TOR: 11 percent Magic Playoff Tickets After six seasons in the lottery, the Magic returned to the playoffs under new head coach Steve Clifford thanks to a second-half surge.Eleven games below .500 on Jan. 29, Orlando went 22-9 the next 31 games to clinch the Southeast Division championship and a playoff spot.Season in a single game: March 26 In a crucial matchup of two in-state rivals vying for the Southeast crown, the Magic went south down Florida's Turnpike and helped spoil Dwyane Wade's night by holding the Heat to 42 percent shooting.First-time All-Star Nikola Vucevic had 24 points, 16 rebounds and 5 assists as all five Orlando starters and sixth man Terrence Ross scored in double figures.But the Magic, per custom, won with defense, holding Miami scoreless for nearly three minutes down the stretch to win a tight game.Why they're dangerous: You won't get anything easily against Orlando.Like all of Clifford's teams, the Magic prioritize taking away high-value looks at the rim and beyond the 3-point line.Orlando is one of four teams that rank in the top 10 in keeping opponents from shooting in both of those locations, per Cleaning the Glass, and forces the fifth-highest rate of midrange attempts in between.The Magic also excel on the defensive glass, ranking third, and boast the league's second-best transition defense, according to Cleaning the Glass.Any score against Orlando will be hard-earned.One big stat and why it matters: The Magic are hitting the postseason on a defensive tear.Orlando sports a 105.0 defensive efficiency since the start of February -- best in the NBA -- and went 21-9 in that stretch to charge into the playoffs.The Magic ranked 16th in defensive efficiency before this stretch, at 109.0 points per 100 possessions.Get to know: Jonathan Isaac Isaac is the quintessential Orlando draft pick of recent vintage: long, young and more athletic than skilled offensively.At 21, he has become the Magic's starting power forward in his second season.Expect Isaac to offer a taste of what's to come at some point during the postseason.What to watch in Round 1: The benches.The second unit has been a big factor in Orlando's second-half surge.With new backup guard Michael Carter-Williams on the court, Orlando has outscored opponents by an incredible 13.0 points per 100 possessions, according to NBA Advanced Stats.Meanwhile, Toronto's second unit has gone from a strength last season to something of a liability in 2018-19.If the Magic are to pull the upset, their bench will have to dominate this matchup.That probably means a strong series for former Raptor Terrence Ross, whose 15.1 PPG ranked fifth among qualified reserve scorers.-- Kevin Pelton 2018-19 record: 51-31 BPI odds vs. BKN: 79 percent 76ers Playoff Tickets Philadelphia has gone through three iterations this season: the one that left training camp with the same starting lineup as last year intact; the one that dramatically changed when two of those starters, Dario Saric and Robert Covington, were traded for Jimmy Butler in November; and the final one after the Sixers traded a large chunk of the roster at February's deadline, adding Tobias Harris and remaking virtually all of the bench.Season in a single game: March 20 Not only did the Sixers finally get a win over the Celtics for the first time this season, but this game also showed the pros and cons of their recreated roster for the world to see.The Phantastic 5 -- Ben Simmons, Joel Embiid, JJ Redick, Butler and Harris -- combined to score 110 of Philadelphia's 118 points on the night, proving just how overpowering they can be to opposing defenses.At the same time, this win highlighted how limited the rest of Philadelphia's roster is in the wake of those moves.There's trouble brewing: There are two glaring issues with Philadelphia's roster: a lack of shooting and a lack of a credible bench.Redick and Harris are terrific shooters, but the rest of the starting lineup is either inconsistent (Butler and Embiid) or nonexistent (Simmons) from deep.The bench, meanwhile, has only one player -- Mike Scott -- that opposing teams are legitimately concerned about come playoff time.The other options -- James Ennis, T.J. McConnell, Jonathon Simmons and Boban Marjanovic -- come with serious limitations that could be exploited by the elite competition Philadelphia will need to surpass in the postseason.One big stat and why it matters: The lineup consisting of Harris, Redick, Butler, Embiid and Simmons has the fourth-best net efficiency this season among five-man lineups, behind only two Golden State lineups and a Pacers lineup (minimum 150 minutes played together).Get to know: Mike Scott Given how thin Philadelphia's bench is, Scott is going to have a significant role for Philadelphia as the lone reserve opposing teams are truly worried about.Scott has his flaws -- he can space out defensively and is prone to making mistakes -- but he's a lights-out shooter who is knocking down 39 percent of his 3s this season.On a team starved for outside shooting, that alone makes Scott a vital piece.What to watch in Round 1: D'Angelo Russell and Spencer Dinwiddie vs. Philly's defense.If this series is going to be interesting, it's going to be because Russell and Dinwiddie, Brooklyn's two-headed monster at point guard, have success attacking the 76ers' defense.Philadelphia has struggled to stop scoring point guards all season, and the Nets have two of them.If Brooklyn can exploit that weakness, this is a series.If Philadelphia can shore it up?Well, things get bleak quickly for the Nets.-- Bontemps 2018-19 record: 42-40 BPI odds vs. PHI: 21 percent Nets Playoff Tickets Back in August, you couldn't find many people outside of downtown Brooklyn who would predict a playoff berth for the Nets.The franchise averaged just 23 wins the past three seasons.But thanks to a breakout year from first-time All-Star D'Angelo Russell, Brooklyn became one of the biggest surprises of this NBA season.Russell and the Nets followed the blueprint established by head coach Kenny Atkinson (play with pace; take shots from behind the arc and in the paint; defend the 3-point line and the rim) and weathered major injuries (Spencer Dinwiddie, Caris LeVert) to make the playoffs for the first time since 2015.Season in a single game: Dec. 7 Riding an eight-game losing streak with the season seemingly slipping away, the Nets got a clutch performance from Russell to secure an overtime win in Toronto.The game encapsulated the Nets' season, with Russell hitting clutch shots and Dinwiddie scoring off the bench to compensate for the absence of a key player (LeVert).Russell scored 29 points -- including six in overtime -- with five assists, and Dinwiddie added 17 points and eight assists off the bench help Brooklyn snap a 12-game losing streak against Toronto.The win seemed to spark the Nets; they won 19 of their next 24 to salvage the season and set up an unexpected run to the playoffs.Why they're dangerous: If the Nets can put Russell in position to attack the paint and create open looks for his teammates, they have a chance to make things uncomfortable for the 76ers.Brooklyn went 11-7 when Russell had at least nine assists this season, per Basketball Reference.One big stat and why it matters: While Philly's bench is among its weaknesses, Brooklyn's thrives.The Nets have received 47.8 bench points per game this season, and their ability to go 11 players deep makes this bench special.Brooklyn is one of two teams -- the Nuggets are the other -- that have had 11 players surpass the 1,000-minute threshold this season.Get to know: Jarrett Allen If the Nets are going to make things interesting against Philly, Allen will probably play a key role.The Nets' shot-blocking 21-year-old center will likely have the unenviable task of guarding Joel Embiid (Embiid had 39 points and 13 rebounds in Philadelphia's most recent game against the Nets).Allen will also be vital for Brooklyn on the other end of the floor: According to Second Spectrum, the pick-and-roll combination of Russell and Allen is the second-most-run play across the NBA (1,535 plays), just behind James Harden in isolation (1,548).What to watch in Round 1: Dinwiddie and LeVert off the bench.Dinwiddie averaged 23.8 points per game while shooting 58 percent from the floor in four games against the Sixers.LeVert has found his shot late in the regular season after missing nearly three months with a foot injury.He averaged 16 points per game on 49 percent shooting in the final eight games of the season.-- Ian Begley 2018-19 record: 49-33 BPI odds vs. IND: 66 percent Celtics Playoff Tickets The only consistent thing about the Celtics this season has been their inconsistency.Boston entered the season as the team favored to replace Cleveland atop the Eastern Conference, but it has been haunted by uneven play and back-and-forths between players on the team in the media.Still, the Celtics enter the playoffs as a team few are willing to count out because of their depth and playoff experience -- though that depth took a huge blow with Marcus Smart being knocked out for the first two rounds because of a torn oblique muscle.Season in a single game (or two!): Nov. 16-17 We're going to cheat a little and do two games here because it perfectly illustrates the bizarre nature of Boston's season.Beating Toronto in overtime might have been Boston's best win of the season and was a terrific performance.Then the Celtics lost the next night to the Jazz -- a reasonable loss, especially on a back-to-back -- and after the game, coach Brad Stevens went in on his team (a rarity for him), and Kyrie Irving (in what became a theme of the season) had pointed words for the team's young players.That Jekyll and Hyde act over those two days sums up the Celtics' 2018-19 campaign.There's trouble brewing: Wait, you mean trouble is brewing in Boston?We kid.Anyone who has watched even a minute of Celtics basketball this season is well aware of the tumult and turmoil.And, as the postseason arrives, the heart of the Celtics -- Smart -- will all but certainly miss at least the first two rounds.Smart has been a legitimate first-team All-Defense-caliber player this season, and has taken large steps forward both in his overall field goal percentage (42.2 percent) and 3-point percentage (36.6 percent).More importantly, he is the obvious emotional leader of the Celtics.Losing him could be a death knell to this team's title chances.Kyrie Irving in clutch time (2018-19) NBA Rank Points 159 3rd Assists 30 4th Field goals 57 1st FG% 49.6 2nd* *Minimum 50 clutch-time field goals One big stat and why it matters: The Celtics have one of the NBA's best closers in Irving, who ranks among the top of the league in several clutch-time stats.Irving has scored or assisted on 57 percent of the Celtics' points in clutch time this season (defined as the final five minutes of the fourth quarter/overtime and the score with five points).Get to know: Jaylen Brown in an expanded role If the Celtics are going to survive Smart's absence, it will be because Brown can step into the role Smart has vacated.Brown has been excellent off the bench the past few months and has arguably been Boston's third-best player since the start of 2019.He'll need to remain at that level if the Celtics have any hope of persevering without Smart.What to watch in Round 1: Gordon Hayward/Brown vs. Domantas Sabonis/Tyreke Evans.Indiana is going to have difficulty keeping up with Boston in this series from a scoring standpoint.One way the Pacers can is if Sabonis and Evans can give them some scoring pop off the bench.Hayward and Brown have been among Boston's best and most consistent players for weeks now, and if they can continue to play that way, an already difficult road for Indiana to make this series competitive will get that much more difficult.-- Bontemps 2018-19 record: 48-34 BPI odds vs. BOS: 34 percent Pacers Playoff Tickets This was essentially a tale of two seasons for the Pacers, who in one critical moment went from vying for a top-three seed in the top-heavy East to treading water as the season came to a close.Their defense is one of the league's best and kept them in most games down the stretch.But the jury is still out on whether the Pacers -- without injured All-Star and franchise player Victor Oladipo -- have enough late-game scoring to close out contests come playoff time.Season in a single game: Jan. 23 Indiana's game on Jan. 23 summed up its season about as well as any other could.The Pacers were leading first-place Toronto in front of their home crowd when Oladipo blew out his right quad, a devastating injury that not only ended the All-Star's season but also likely ended Indiana's chances of making a significant playoff run.Yet for how deflating that image of Oladipo being hauled off on a stretcher was, the hard-nosed Pacers battled and held on to win in his absence -- something they weren't built to do a season ago, when they went a dismal 0-7 in contests without him.Why they're dangerous: Even without Oladipo, no one should be shocked if the Pacers find a way to beat Boston in the first round.After all, they took LeBron and the Cavs to a Game 7 last year (albeit with Oladipo), and the Celtics have looked shaky for much of the season.Losing the battle for home-court advantage stings, but it might help that the Pacers' best perimeter shooter, Doug McDermott, has shot the ball much better on the road than at home.Indiana -- 14-4 when hitting 12 3s or more -- is hard to beat when it connects from distance.Fewest points allowed (2018-19) TEAM PPG allowed Indiana Pacers 104.7 Miami Heat 105.9 Memphis Grizzlies 106.1 Utah Jazz 106.5 Orlando Magic 106.6 One big stat and why it matters: If the score stays under 100 points, there's a good chance that Indy is coming out on top.The Pacers are 22-1 this season when limiting opponents to 97 points or fewer.The Pacers also held their opponents to 104.7 points per game during the regular season, the fewest in the NBA.Get to know: Bojan Bogdanovic Bogdanovic was vitally important for Indiana last season as the team's top defensive option on LeBron.But since Oladipo's injury, he has been the Pacers' No.1 option on offense, initiating sets as a pick-and-roll ball handler and averaging about 21 points per game -- up from 16 per game before Oladipo was sidelined.The Pacers need Bogdanovic to play well to win the series, but the forward averaged just 13.5 points against Boston this season, his lowest scoring average against any Eastern Conference team.What to watch in Round 1: The Pacers' traps vs. Kyrie Irving.If the All-Star guard gets it going, the Pacers might have to throw different looks at him to break his scoring rhythm.But if they opt to trap, will that effectively slow him down?Indiana misplayed an Irving screen-and-roll with Al Horford in the closing seconds of a March 29 game, allowing Irving to slither all the way to the rim for a game-winning bucket.But generally, the Pacers have struggled when trying to trap, surrendering 1.21 points per possession when trapping this season, the second-worst rate in the NBA, according to Second Spectrum.-- Chris Herring Statistics provided by ESPN Stats & Information
Max Holloway or Dustin Poirier? Top MMA trainers give their picks:::::A lot has changed since Dustin Poirier submitted Max Holloway in the first round of a featherweight bout at UFC 143 in 2012.Holloway (20-3) became a featherweight champion and has turned into one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world.At age 27, he's already working on "legacy fights" and will attempt to claim an interim lightweight title against Poirier at UFC 236 in Atlanta.Poirier (24-5) is more of a late bloomer, if you want to call it that.He has steadily worked his way up the lightweight rankings and cemented a title shot by defeating two former UFC champions (Eddie Alvarez and Anthony Pettis) in his past three fights.Who has the edge in Saturday's rematch?ESPN asked some of the brightest minds in the sport to break it down.Duane Ludwig, Ludwig Martial Arts Holloway needs to make sure he keeps his distance, and Poirier needs to press him and get inside his punches.Poirier tends to sit back and counter a little bit, though, and he also has good length.To me, it's whoever can push, pull and then return -- what I mean by that is, if you throw a right cross and the guy leans back and then goes to counter, I have to counter the counter.I think it will be a game of touch, pull, return.Whoever counters the counter will win.I love Max's accuracy, volume and fluidity between his stances.He's maturing as a fighter and no longer following the misconception that you can't cross your feet.He's crossing his feet quite a bit, fighting out of both stances, from an athletic stance.That allows him to control distance.He's able to close distance by making full, fluid steps.If you're in a traditional stance, gaining ground like a traditional boxer, where your lead foot comes forward and then the back foot meets it, you're covering 6 to 8 inches.Maybe a foot.If you walk and take your right foot and step it all the way forward to southpaw, you just covered twice the space.Now, your foot is in the air during that time, so you have to know how to do it and when to do it, but you're able to cover more space.My prediction is an awesome stand-up fight.Max is on top right now, mentally, physically, spiritually.It's very hard to beat Max right now.He knows he's a champion.John Kavanagh, SBG Ireland Max is just a completely different fighter since losing to Conor [in August 2013].I believe around the time he fought Cub Swanson [in April 2015], I said he was the second-best 145-pounder -- after Conor.Since then, he's just improved every fight and naturally grown into a 155-pounder.Dustin has also improved a lot since losing to Conor.Plus, he's beaten some genuinely tough 155-pounders.Overall, I think Max has improved most, and I think he gets it done by decision.Danny Castillo, Team Alpha Male I feel like Dustin's self-confidence and experience have reached a certain point where he believes he's invincible -- but Max has the same thing going.I think Max Holloway truly believes nobody on this planet can beat him.Max is really long and super-accurate on the feet.I believe his punching power might be a little more, as he goes up in weight and fills out his body.Part of his game we just haven't seen much of is his jiu-jitsu.That's not to say it isn't good; he's just done such a good job of stopping the takedown to not even show that aspect of his game.One thing Brian Ortega did [in a loss to Holloway in December] was smother him against the fence, but Ortega doesn't really have a good takedown.He was just using his upper body and keeping him in a clinch though.As far as going down to the legs and shooting, Ortega doesn't have that.His takedowns are mostly getting into a clinch and pulling guard.I think if Dustin has an opportunity to win this fight, it's against the cage, but maybe following with a takedown.I can't pick a winner.Marc Montoya, Factory X MMA Big fan of both.They do have contrasting styles.Poirier is super-calculated on the feet and has the ability to find power when it's needed.Holloway has power, but he's more of a volume striker.He's a rhythm guy.I think the big key with Poirier is, how does he break Holloway's rhythm?Let's say Holloway's combo is a jab, cross, hook.If you allow him to throw that, he's able to find his rhythm.So in that example of the 1-2-3, you have to be able to break it.When he throws the jab, can Poirier slip it and prevent him from throwing the 2-3?That's what I mean when I talk about rhythm.Can he move into the clinch, or land a front kick that disrupts what Holloway is doing?When a rhythm guy finds his "swag" is what I call it, he's very dangerous -- and both guys, but especially Holloway, do a great job with that.That's a start-to-finish battle, because rhythm fighters are great at finding it and, once it's disrupted, resetting and finding it again.It can be frustrating fighting someone like that because you'll land a good shot, but the other guy keeps coming offensively.Dustin is from a great camp, so I guarantee they've mimicked that in practice.If I had to put money on it, I hate to say this, because I'm a fan of both, I would probably give Holloway the edge.Max Holloway and Dustin Poirier will fight for the UFC's interim lightweight belt on Saturday in the main event of UFC 236.Hans Gutknecht/Los Angeles Daily News/Getty Images Duke Roufus, Roufusport This is going to be a battle of wills.I've coached against both of these lions, and they're both similar.They're mean volume punchers.I think Max Holloway is in his true weight class of 155 now.I think he's going to start knocking guys out in this division.I feel his accuracy has always been excellent, and now at 155, he's going to pack more of a punch with that accuracy.That being said, Dustin Poirier has been on a hell of a tear.I think you're gonna see Dustin box, and he has a great double-leg takedown.If he can get Max to the ground and kind of keep his back to the mat, isolate him, I think he can slow this fight down, and that's his best way to win.In a fight of this magnitude, where the wrestling is won is how well Dustin throws strikes first.When he strikes first and follows with takedowns, he's hard to beat.He has a great team behind him, and he's a black belt in jiu-jitsu.Dustin is hard to get out of there.I can't pick if there's going to be a stoppage, but I think Max Holloway is going to be our new interim champion.On paper, we couldn't ask for a better fight.John Crouch, MMA Lab I love the fight.I love Max.I can't bet against him.I think he's at a whole different point in his career now.It's going to be a tough fight, though.I don't see it hitting the floor at all, because I don't think Max will let that happen.And I don't think Dustin cares.I think he's willing to give people fireworks.He's got to get the range in his favor.You can't stay at the end of Max's punches.He's so good at floating, and then killing you.You've got to do something about the range either with pressure or angles.Dustin has a lot of good coaches, and that's where I would start.Threaten with takedowns, even if you don't get them.That's the only way to beat him.I don't think Dustin is naturally a pressure fighter, but he's not scared to do it.When he fought Justin Gaethje (April 2018), they just went at it.When he fought Eddie Alvarez, both times they went at it.He's good enough to do it, and he's willing to step in there.I think Max is a better wrestler than he used to be, and his physical presence when he fights is bigger.He's a grown man.He was a kid when he fought Dustin the first time.I'm gonna say Max by TKO in the fourth round.Sayif Saud, Fortis MMA Dustin Poirier is one of the most underrated fighters in the sport.He has a wealth of experience, long amateur career.He's hitting his streak.But Max Holloway is in the zone, just like Anderson Silva was during his run.He has so much confidence.You saw that when he fought Jose Aldo, just walking him down, eating Jose Aldo's shots.Strikingwise, they can go tit for tat.Both have great lead hands, great jabs.They both switch stances.The big question is whether Max can take that shot at 155 pounds from a power striker like Dustin.I think he can, but that damage will wear him down.The shots at 155 will be more damaging than the ones he took at 145, which he seemingly walked through easily.I think his chin will hold up, but Dustin, with that straight left and beautiful right hook, he could put Max in trouble.Will Dustin's size factor in the clinch, as well?It could wear Max down in a fourth- and fifth-round situation.Or will Max's experience shine through in the fourth and fifth?If I were coaching Dustin, I would absolutely involve some clinching.Try to wear Max down in his first fight at 155.Clinch, break off with elbows and dirty boxing, control that distance all the time and make him deal with the size of a lightweight.And if you can convert takedowns in the later rounds, why would you not?These two guys could go head-to-head in striking, which is what makes this so exciting.They could just stand and bang.The later it goes, Dustin has the advantage.I think Max will come out strong and confident in the first and second rounds, but as it goes on, the probability of Dustin winning goes up.It really is 50-50.When Max Holloway and Dustin Poirier met seven years ago, Poirier quickly took command on the mat against the 20-year-old Holloway, who was making his UFC debut.Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images Henri Hooft, HKickboxing They both have very good hands.Max is more of a volume puncher, while Dustin is very precise with his shots.On the floor, I think they're both really good.Man, this is a really, really close matchup.And who doesn't like these guys?Max is a great champion.And Dustin, it's his time to win the belt.If he doesn't do it now, it won't happen.You can't take away Dustin's last couple of fights.Before, if things weren't going his way, then they weren't going his way.Now, if something doesn't go his way, he goes back, sits on his chair and comes out the next round and pulls it off.A prediction is so difficult.I think Max is going to win.He's been the champion and knows how to win these fights.I do think it has to be now for Dustin to win the belt, but winning the belt is not something that happens for everybody.I think the weight will be a little different for Max, but he will pull it off.
Meet Jalin Turner, the tarantula-collecting lightweight ready to break through at UFC 236:::::When he was a kid, Jalin "The Tarantula" Turner was afraid of spiders.Instead of avoiding them, Turner confronted his fear as a young adult.He started by caring for one tarantula.Then there were 10.By the time he was done, he had more than 200 tarantulas."You just get addicted to collecting them," said Turner, 23, a blossoming lightweight who will face Matt Frevola at UFC 236 on Saturday."I was breeding them at the time, so I had a bunch of them.It got crazy.It's a whole underground world.I was developing a fear and dislike for spiders, so I casually got one as a pet to get over that.It just intrigued me so much.I've never seen anything like it."He understands his favorite pet.Tarantulas are intimidating and captivating.Even those who loathe them can't take their eyes off them.On Saturday night, in his third UFC bout, after being discovered on "Dana White's Contender Series" last year, Turner hopes to attract attention, too.The UFC undercard is an opportunity for young fighters.With a great performance or two, unheralded combatants can take steps toward becoming stars.But one rough night can banish a fighter as well.Turner understands both scenarios.In October, in his UFC debut, free-spirited tactics cost Turner when Vicente Luque caught him with a right hand as he tried to throw a spinning elbow during their clash at UFC 229.Turner went down, and Luque threw five vicious ground-and-pound strikes that put "The Tarantula" to sleep."I learned not to fight at 170 [pounds]," Turner said."That's the biggest thing I can take away from it."Turner earned quick redemption and praise, however, with a win in his next fight.In February, his combination of strikes and a kick to the ribs led to a 53-second knockout of Callan Potter on the undercard of UFC 234, which featured Israel Adesanya vs. Anderson Silva in the main event.That fight allowed Turner to showcase his talents.At 6-foot-3, he's a lengthy fighter who can control the distance with his striking ability and size.After earning his way into UFC via Dana White's Contender series, Jalin Turner got caught by Vicente Luque and lost his debut via TKO in October.It was still a valuable experience, as Turner explained, "I learned I still love what I do, even if I lose."Stephen R. Sylvanie/USA TODAY Sports In 2013, Conor McGregor made his UFC debut in a fight broadcast on Facebook, getting a quick TKO of Marcus Brimage.Four months later, McGregor earned a unanimous decision over Max Holloway on the undercard of UFC Fight Night: Shogun vs. Sonnen.A year after his debut, McGregor headlined a UFC Fight Night card, earned a Performance of the Night bonus with a first-round TKO of Diego Brandao and never fought on an undercard again.That's the blueprint for every young fighter.Turner has tried to ignore the stakes attached to Saturday's fight, but he's aware of the potential impact on his career and his life.The UFC is now on ESPN and ESPN+.Subscribe to ESPN+ to get: exclusive live UFC events, weigh-ins and more; Ariel and the Bad Guy; Dana White's Contender Series; and more exclusive MMA content.In March, Turner and his fiance announced the pending arrival of their second child and posted the gender reveal moment on Instagram.Turner burst a balloon with a spinning back kick to reveal they are having a girl.That's why the financial element of Saturday's fight matters, too."I'm excited for her," Turner said."I can't wait to see her.It's just more motivating.I've got two kids.I've got a fiance.I need to step it up.I gotta put my big boy pants on now."In the past, Turner tried to work a 9-to-5 job while training.It's a constant battle for fighters still chasing the prestige and cash that will allow them to train and fight full-time.While he was training with Greg Jackson and Mike Winkeljohn in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he asked his employer, Amazon, for a leave of absence to prepare for a bout.The company said no.So he quit.Turner then worked the graveyard shift at a Nordstrom during his next training camp for a Bellator fight, months before the birth of his first child.His shift would start at 11 p.m. and finish at 7 a.m. From there, he'd drive from his Southern California home in San Bernardino to train with Michael Bisping in Costa Mesa before completing the 120-mile daily roundtrip by driving back to San Bernardino to train at Adrenaline MMA, his home gym.At night, he had to go back to Nordstrom.Jalin Turner's opportunity in the UFC didn't come easily, as he had to balance a regular job, a growing family and his MMA dreams as he hoped to fight for a living.Asanka Brendon Ratnayake for ESPN "I would try to get some sleep," he said."I did that for a whole training camp, about six months.I ended up having a baby.It was just so much on my plate at the time."That's a burden he hopes to eliminate as he awaits the birth of his next child.He hopes to dazzle on Saturday night.He knows he has to put on a show to get noticed.Turner got his start in the sport that way.He was 17 when a friend, who was training in mixed martial arts, sparred with Turner in his backyard.Turner impressed him, so his buddy convinced him to get serious about training.But Turner couldn't afford the gym fees.He created his own workout by grabbing an old couch and turning it upright."I didn't have money for a punching bag," he said.He hung a jump rope and threw punches, night and day, to develop his timing and precision.He watched MMA videos on YouTube.Turner didn't know how to train, but he'd run two miles on a whim while listening to the sounds of Nipsey Hussle.(He will walk out to one of the recently deceased rapper's songs on Saturday.)Turner trained as if he had an upcoming fight.He didn't really know what he was doing at the time.He just knew he loved it.Now Turner's in the headlining fight of the UFC 236 undercard -- a moment that could change his life.He said he's not worried about Frevola.He's more focused on his own strengths than his opponent's weaknesses."I just want people to look at my performance as masterful and look at it as, 'He's good at his craft,'" Turner said."Like a mural with me painting."
The best (and worst) NFL draft classes at every position:::::What's the best draft class of all time?If you asked a football fan to identify the best draft pick ever, it would take about two seconds to point to Tom Brady as the 199th pick of the 2000 draft.Likewise, if you asked someone which team had the best single draft in league history, they would probably point to the 1974 Steelers and their four Hall of Famers, although the 1971 class might actually be better.In terms of positions, though, the only positional class most fans know by heart is the famous quarterback class of 1983, which produced three Hall of Famers in the first round.In preparing for this year's draft and what is reportedly an incredible crop of defensive linemen, I started to wonder about those positional classes.If that's the best year for quarterbacks in draft history, what's the best running back or offensive line class?And what was the most productive draft year in league history?I went ahead and built a simple, admittedly arbitrary stat to try and calculate that figure.Using pro-football-reference.com's database, I went through each draft pick since the AFL-NFL merger for 1970 and awarded them a draft score, with one point for every year as a starter, four points for a Pro Bowl berth, eight points for a first-team All-Pro nod, and a 40-point bonus for making the Hall of Fame.I preassigned Hall of Fame nods to absolute locks for Canton like Brady and J.J. Watt to try to get an accurate read of more recent drafts, and after evaluating each class by the numbers, I tried to apply common sense to sort through close calls.I treated a seven-time Pro Bowler at receiver as more valuable than a seven-time Pro Bowler who was listed at receiver but made it to Hawaii for special teams, because the league also values the offensive/defensive player as more important.For each positional group, I'll list my pick for the top three draft classes going back through 1970.I'll also include a recent draft class that might have a shot at challenging for legendary status, and I'll also throw in the worst class over that same time frame for good measure.Since we don't know much about how the past few classes will turn out, I'll generally leave them out.Jump to a position: QB | RB | WR | TE OL | DL | LB | DB Best overall classes QUARTERBACK Third place: 1998 The '98 draft was led by a pair of quarterbacks who went in very different directions, of course, in Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf.Manning's presence as an inner-circle greatest quarterback of all time candidate makes him the focal point of this class, which yielded a second long-term starter, Packers draftee Matt Hasselbeck.Two starters might not seem like a great haul, but when one of those two is as good as Manning, it rates out as superior to deeper classes like 2005 (Aaron Rodgers, Alex Smith, Jason Campbell, Ryan Fitzpatrick) and 1973 (Dan Fouts, Ron Jaworski, Joe Ferguson, Bert Jones).Pats fans will wonder about the 2000 class, where Brady came off the board at 199, but guys like Chad Pennington and Marc Bulger didn't have the longevity to compete with Hasselbeck.Second place: 2004 Nine quarterbacks in NFL history have thrown at least 7,000 passes.Three of them were drafted among the first 11 picks in 2004.Looking back, I don't think we would argue that Eli Manning (first overall) turned out to be a better pro passer than Philip Rivers (fourth) or Ben Roethlisberger (11th), but this is just about the platonic ideal for teams that draft a quarterback in the first round and hope to find a guy they can stick in the lineup for 15 years.Matt Schaub pieced together a run as a starter with the Texans after being drafted by the Falcons in the third round, too.The 2004 NFL draft featured three quarterbacks in the top 11 picks: Eli Manning, Philip Rivers and Ben Roethlisberger.Bob Leverone/Sporting News via Getty Images First place: 1983 This should surprise exactly nobody.There's a chance the 2004 class could eventually send three quarterbacks to Canton, although Roethlisberger seems to be the only sure thing to make it to the Hall of Fame.The '83 draft already has three legendary quarterbacks enshrined in John Elway, Jim Kelly and Dan Marino, who combined for 23 Pro Bowl appearances.Ken O'Brien spent seven years as the primary starter for the Jets, marking a fourth valuable player drafted in the first round.Todd Blackledge and Tony Eason didn't reach lofty heights, but Eason was still good enough to start a Super Bowl.Class to watch: 2016 The 2018 draft produced five first-round quarterbacks for only the second time since that legendary 1983 class, and the 2017 draft has already produced one MVP season from Patrick Mahomes.But the top three quarterbacks from 2016 -- Jared Goff, Carson Wentz and Dak Prescott -- have combined for five Pro Bowl nods in three years.The 2012 class will also have four Week 1 starters in Andrew Luck, Russell Wilson, Nick Foles and Kirk Cousins.Sandwiched between Luck (first overall) and Wilson (75th), teams drafted Robert Griffin (second), Ryan Tannehill (eighth), Brandon Weeden (22nd), and Brock Osweiler (57th).This stuff is hard.Worst class: 2013 I like to give more recent classes a chance to develop before putting them in historical perspective, but I think we're about ready to close the door on the 2013 QB room.Only one quarterback was taken in each of the first three rounds, and they combined for four years as starters: two from second-rounder Geno Smith and one each from first-rounder EJ Manuel and third-rounder Mike Glennon.The only signal-callers drafted after the third round to throw more than 10 passes are Matt Barkley and Landry Jones.Even dismal classes like 1976 and 1996 produced multiyear starters in Richard Todd and Tony Banks.The 2013 class is about as bad as it gets at the league's most important position.RUNNING BACK Third place: 1983 There are essentially five classes for three spots here.This class is joined by four different ones over a seven-year span from 1989 to 1995.I wouldn't fault you for putting them in any order.I'm leaving out 1989, which delivered one Hall of Famer, Barry Sanders, but otherwise had Pro Bowlers who were fullbacks (Daryl Johnston), glorified fullbacks (Marion Butts) or backs who went for their work as returners (Dave Meggett, Eric Metcalf).The 1993 class produced another Hall of Famer, Jerome Bettis, and sent four other backs to the Pro Bowl, but players like Garrison Hearst, Robert Smith and Natrone Means had relatively short peaks.The 1983 class, on the other hand, produced a superior Hall of Fame back to Bettis in Eric Dickerson.With a 12-round draft, 1983 also sent five other backs to Hawaii, including three-time attendee Curt Warner and four-time Pro Bowler Roger Craig.Nine different backs racked up 3,000 rushing yards or more as pros.Hall of Fame running back Terrell Davis made three first-team All-Pro teams.AP Photo/Tom DiPace Second place: 1995 At first glance, you would assume that the 1995 draft was disastrous for running backs.The first overall pick was Ki-Jana Carter, who tore his ACL in preseason of his rookie year and never made an impact in the NFL.Teams used five first-round picks and three second-round picks on running backs, and none of them made a Pro Bowl.The only one to even start more than three seasons was James Stewart.This is a two-back draft class, but in Terrell Davis and Curtis Martin, 1995 is the only class since the merger to send two running backs to the Hall of Fame.Martin, a third-round pick of the Patriots, spent three years in New England before signing an offer sheet to follow Bill Parcells to the Jets.Davis was the most notable of the many backs to excel in Alex Gibbs' zone scheme and was named a first-team All-Pro three times in his four healthy seasons as a starter in Denver.The only other Pro Bowlers from this class were fullback William Henderson and special-teamer Travis Jervey.First place: 1990 When the class starts with the league's all-time leading rusher, Emmitt Smith, it's off to a good start.There's no second Hall of Famer in this bunch to compete with Davis or Martin, but the sheer depth is staggering.Eleven different backs made at least one Pro Bowl during their respective careers.Eight different backs from the 1990 class produced 1,000-yard rushing seasons, topped only by the 10 of the 2008 class.(That group looked on pace to be legendary, but after backs like Chris Johnson and Jamaal Charles failed to produce lengthy careers, it's unlikely to produce a Hall of Famer.)Class to watch: 2017 Though fourth overall pick Leonard Fournette hasn't lived up to expectations and Kareem Hunt's future is uncertain, this class has already produced five 1,000-yard seasons in only two calendar years.Christian McCaffrey and Alvin Kamara appear to be the two best backs of the bunch, but with a second tier of Dalvin Cook, Joe Mixon, James Conner, Tarik Cohen, Marlon Mack, and Aaron Jones, there's plenty of upside remaining.Worst class: 1992 In a class with three first-round picks and two second-round selections, the only back from the 1992 draft to top 1,000 yards in a single campaign was fourth-rounder Edgar Bennett, who got to 1,067 yards in his fourth season.The only back from this bunch to make the Pro Bowl was Michael Bates, and while he went five times, it was as a return man.Honorable mention goes to 1987, a draft which had seven running backs come off the board in the first round with only one back -- second-rounder Christian Okoye -- posting a 1,000-yard season.WIDE RECEIVER Third place: 1985 The top wide receiver draft classes basically require two Hall of Famers to even earn consideration; the best of the best are good enough that we can leave superstar starting groups like 1974 (Steelers teammates Lynn Swann and John Stallworth) and 2001 (Reggie Wayne, Steve Smith and Chad Johnson) off the podium.It's good to start a wideout class with the greatest receiver of all time, and while Jerry Rice wasn't the first wide receiver off the board in 1985, he finished with the highest score by our career measure of any player taken since 1970.Rice is also fifth in career approximate value behind Peyton Manning, Brady, Drew Brees and Brett Favre.He's pretty good.Rice lines up next to a fellow Hall of Famer, Andre Reed, whom the Bills took in the fourth round; the five wideouts chosen before him combined for 33 career catches.Reed topped that figure with 48 in his rookie season and then added 903 more over the ensuing 15 seasons.The Bills also contribute a star special-teamer to this bunch in seven-time Pro Bowler Steve Tasker, although I would consider him to be less of a receiver for the purposes of this list.The only other wideout to make more than one Pro Bowl from this class, though, was Al Toon of the Jets.Jerry Rice, the undisputed greatest receiver of all time, had 1,549 catches and 197 touchdowns in his career.George Rose/Getty Images Second place: 1996 This class took a leap forward in 2018 when Terrell Owens was enshrined in Canton, giving them a second Hall of Famer alongside Marvin Harrison.Both Harrison and Owens have complicated legacies for different reasons, but they combined for 14 Pro Bowl appearances and still each rank in the top 10 in career receiving yards.The guys in this class simply lasted a long time.There were six wideouts from the Class of 1996 -- Owens, Harrison, Keyshawn Johnson, Eric Moulds, Amani Toomer and Muhsin Muhammad -- who started for 10 or more seasons in the NFL.Only one other class since 1970 managed to produce more than two 10-year starters, and that's our first-place draft class, which managed only three.I think the top of that group is higher, which is why it's No.1, but you could easily swap these two.First place: 1988 The Hall of Famers in this class require little introduction: it's hard to argue against Tim Brown and Michael Irvin as two of the best wideouts of their respective eras.The second tier includes a pair of five-time Pro Bowlers, Anthony Miller and Sterling Sharpe, the latter of whom was on a Hall of Fame trajectory before suffering a career-ending neck injury.Given that Terrell Davis just made the Hall of Fame for a relatively short peak, Sharpe's seven-year career -- which included four top-three finishes in terms of fantasy production at wideout -- might deserve further Hall consideration in its own right.That's a strong top four, and even beyond those stars, 10 different receivers from the 1988 draft started at least five seasons as a pro, including notables like Brian Blades, Brett Perriman and Michael Haynes.The only other year with 10 such players was 1996.Rice is better than any individual wideout from this group, but the sheer depth of this class pushes them into the top spot.Demaryius Thomas has 688 catches and 62 touchdowns in his career.Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports Class to watch: 2010 Injuries took a toll on this class last year, as Demaryius Thomas, Dez Bryant and Emmanuel Sanders all tore Achilles tendons weeks apart from one another.Antonio Brown, the best wideout from the group, also manufactured a trade to Oakland, which won't help his Hall of Fame stock, and Golden Tate moved to the Giants to catch passes from Eli Manning.This class ranked out as seventh all time without projecting anybody as a Hall of Famer, but it probably needs Brown to keep things up for a few more years and a long second act from someone like Thomas or Tate to create an unlikely second Hall of Famer and move into the top four.Worst class: 1997 One year after the second-best wideout class in history, the 1997 draft delivered an absolute stinker.It wasn't for lack of pedigree, either; teams used four first-round picks and seven of the top 53 picks on wideouts.The best of those wideouts was Ike Hilliard, who was drafted with the seventh pick and racked up 6,397 yards over 12 seasons, more than the other six guys combined.The first-rounders include Yatil Green, who missed his first two seasons because of a pair of ACL tears, and Rae Carruth, who was convicted of conspiring to murder his girlfriend during his third season in the NFL.TIGHT END Third place: 1997 Tight end classes are relatively thin, so one Hall of Famer goes a long way to pushing a class up the rankings.When you have a 14-time Pro Bowler leading the way, Tony Gonzalez is enough to all-but-single-handedly make the 1997 class legendary.His longevity pushes this one-man class over similar groups like 2003 (Jason Witten) and 1979 (Kellen Winslow).Second place: 1978 The first tight end taken in this class was seventh overall pick Ken MacAfee, who lasted only two seasons before the 49ers tried to convert him to guard, at which point MacAfee left to pursue dentistry.The 23rd pick was slightly more productive, as Ozzie Newsome might be one of the few human beings alive who deserves to make the Hall of Fame as a player and as an executive.The Cowboys then chose five-time Pro Bowler Todd Christensen in the second round, although the H-back never played a regular-season down in Dallas.The 2010 draft produced Rob Gronkowski and a few other stellar tight ends.Jeff Zelevansky/Getty Images First place: 2010 It's already there.If we assume that Rob Gronkowski is going to be a Hall of Famer in five years, this is the second-best tight end class of all time.It'll pip the 1978 class if Jimmy Graham and Ed Dickson start for their respective teams this season, and Graham himself might have an outside shot at the Hall of Fame if he can piece together a couple of more Pro Bowl campaigns in his 30s.Draft Academy Draft Academy documents the journey of six prospects: Nick Bosa, Marquise Brown, Drew Lock, Tyree Jackson, Jarrett Stidham and Josh Jacobs.Watch on ESPN+ Class to watch: 2013 Now that Gronk is retired, the top two tight ends in football might be Zach Ertz and Travis Kelce, each of whom were taken in the middle rounds of the 2013 draft.Jordan Reed and Tyler Eifert might also still have productive seasons to come, although health has obviously been an issue for both.Worst class: 1971 According to pro-football-reference, only one tight end -- Buffalo's Jan White -- was taken before the 80th selection of the draft.Fifth-rounder Bob Moore was the only tight end of the class to start more than two seasons as a pro.OFFENSIVE LINE Third place: 1994 As is the case for wide receivers, the buy-in for consideration here is a minimum of two Hall of Famers.Unlike the wideout classes, though, the groups here tend to have a huge drop-off from those two Hall of Famers to the rest of the bunch.The 1994 roster would feature one of the most devastating -- and versatile -- interiors in modern league history.Center Kevin Mawae started his career at right guard before spending 14 years at the pivot for the Seahawks, Jets and Titans.He ranks as one of the best free-agent signings in league history for the Jets, who don't exactly have a great track record on the interior.Mawae is joined by massive Cowboys and 49ers lineman Larry Allen, who played everywhere besides center during his 14-year career and might rate as the most terrifying athlete along the line in league history.After that, though, there's a drop-off: the starting five would include guys like Todd Steussie, Wayne Gandy and Tre' Johnson, who were closer to solid starters than stars.Larry Allen was named as a first-team All-Pro six times in his career.Peter Brouillet/NFLPhotoLibrary Second place: 1980 The turn-of-the-decade line starts with Bengals stalwart Anthony Munoz, who might be the best offensive lineman in league history.He slots in at left tackle, and Dolphins Hall of Famer Dwight Stephenson sneaks ahead of six-time Pro Bowler Ray Donaldson as part of the best center class in league history.The most notable member of this line is otherwise longtime Steelers right tackle Tunch Ilkin.First place: 1973 The best guard duo from a single draft class in league history, meanwhile, consists of Hall of Famers John Hannah and Joe DeLamielleure.Hannah probably was the best draft pick in Patriots history before Tom Brady.This team can piece together a whole line of Pro Bowlers with center Larry McCarren and tackles Jerry Sisemore and Leon Gray, the latter of whom was Hannah's longtime teammate in New England.Class to watch: 2010 Offensive line is badly underrepresented in Canton, but there's a pair of Hall of Fame candidates from this class in Washington tackle Trent Williams and Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey.You could form a deep line with Russell Okung, Rodger Saffold and Mike Iupati, although the latter has declined badly since leaving San Francisco.Worst class: 1991 The NFL chose 57 offensive linemen in the 1991 draft, including four first-rounders, four second-rounders and six third-rounders.Exactly one of those 57 linemen made it to the Pro Bowl: Cowboys tackle Erik Williams, a third-round pick who wasn't even Dallas' first offensive line selection in that draft.(former coach Jimmy Johnson chose James Richards seven picks before Williams, but the Cal product didn't even make the roster out of camp.)DEFENSIVE LINE Third place: 2011 This seemed as it were on pace to become the best pass-rushing class in NFL history, but stars like Aldon Smith, Muhammad Wilkerson and Robert Quinn have fallen off after great starts to their careers for various reasons.Even with that in mind, you can build a devastating front four from the guys who are still playing at a high level.It all starts with future Hall of Famer J.J. Watt at defensive end, and you can pick between Cameron Jordan and Ryan Kerrigan on the other side of the line.On the interior, the Class of 2011 can start Jurrell Casey and push Steelers end Cameron Heyward in to defensive tackle for an absolutely terrifying front four.This doesn't even include Von Miller or Justin Houston, who are treated as linebackers for the purposes of this list.J.J. Watt already has 92 career sacks since being drafted in 2011.Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images Second place: 1985 This is a three-person line, but it's an awful good three-person line.At defensive end, the Class of 1985 sports Bruce Smith and Chris Doleman, who rank first (Smith, 200) and fifth (Doleman, 150.5) in career sacks.Between them is five-time Pro Bowler Ray Childress.There's a big drop-off for the rest of the class, but let's throw in William "Refrigerator" Perry as a run-plugger and goal-line back.First place: 1975 This class predates official sack statistics, but it features another pair of Hall of Famers, Cowboys tackle Randy White and Chargers/49ers end Fred Dean.Keep in mind that once the NFL started tracking sacks, Dean racked up 17.5 of them during his ninth season in 1983.The line also features four other first-team All-Pros, Louie Kelcher, Gary Johnson, Doug English and Cleveland Elam.Class to watch: 2011 You can't count on Smith or Quinn to return to form, but Jordan has played like a Defensive Player of the Year candidate over the past couple of seasons and could very well be on a Hall of Fame trajectory if he keeps this up.With Watt, Miller, Patrick Peterson and Richard Sherman, Jordan could give this class a fifth Hall of Famer.Worst class: 1982 Despite the fact that the first overall pick in the 1982 draft was defensive end Kenneth Sims and 10 of the first 54 picks in the draft were defensive linemen, not a single member of this draft class made it to a Pro Bowl.The only lineman who started more than seven seasons in the league was Seahawks end Jeff Bryant.LINEBACKER Third place: 1996 This group starts with a Hall of Fame linebacker from the AFC North in Ray Lewis.Zach Thomas, who made seven Pro Bowls for the Dolphins, probably belongs in the Hall of Fame himself.The third linebacker in this bunch isn't clear, but you can pick between Patriots stalwart Tedy Bruschi or longtime Chiefs and Chargers linebacker Donnie Edwards to fill out the bunch.Ray Lewis, who was picked No.26 overall in the 1996 draft, was named to 13 Pro Bowls.Doug Pensinger/Getty Images Second place: 1974 Dj vu.Another member of the legendary Steelers draft class of 1974 paces this group, as Jack Lambert is the lone Hall of Fame linebacker here.He's joined by seven-time Pro Bowler Randy Gradishar, who is one of the best players in NFL history outside of Canton.Throw in Matt Blair, who made six consecutive Pro Bowls for the Vikings from 1977 to 1982, and you have the best linebacking draft of the '70s.The presence of a third Hall of Fame candidate pushes 1974 ahead of 1996.First place: 1981 This is arguably the biggest no-brainer at any of these positional groups.The second- and third-placed classes have one no-brainer Hall of Famer.The class of 1981 has two in Lawrence Taylor and Mike Singletary, then added a third Hall of Famer when star Saints edge rusher Rickey Jackson made it to Canton in 2010.This might be the best class in league history without Taylor, and he's arguably the most important defensive player of the past 40 years.Pretty good.Since being drafted in the first round in 2012, Luke Kuechly has been named a first-team All-Pro five times.Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports Class to watch: 2012 The 2011 class has Miller and Houston, but the 2012 class has a better shot at delivering two Hall of Famers with inside linebackers Luke Kuechly and Bobby Wagner.Throw in Bucs outside linebacker Lavonte David and you would have the rangiest trio of cover linebackers the league has ever seen.Worst class: 2001 The linebackers of 2001 combined to make only two Pro Bowls, and they came from first-round picks Dan Morgan and Kendrell Bell, each of whom failed to make it to a sixth season as a starter.In fact, the only linebacker from this class to start more than five seasons for his team was Dolphins and Texans 'backer Morlon Greenwood.DEFENSIVE BACK Third place: 2003 This class probably will yield only one Hall of Famer, Troy Polamalu, but 11 different defensive backs made it to the Pro Bowl, the most of any draft class since the merger.There might not be a Hall of Famer in the bunch at corner, but you could build a devastating secondary with Charles Tillman, Nnamdi Asomugha, Asante Samuel, Terence Newman and Marcus Trufant.Second place: 1983 This group is more about longevity at a high level than anything else.It's the only secondary class since the merger with five defensive backs who started at least 10 seasons, led by longtime Washington corner and Hall of Famer Darrell Green.The class can boast Gill Byrd, Albert Lewis, Lionel Washington and Carl Lee at corner across from Green, with Vikings star Joey Browner and Dave Duerson at safety.Ronnie Lott made 10 Pro Bowls over his career.George Rose/Getty Images First place: 1981 This secondary starts with 49ers safety Ronnie Lott, who forms a Hall of Fame duo alongside Kenny Easley of the Seahawks.Throw in six-time Pro Bowler Dennis Smith, and this is the best safety class in league history.This class isn't quite as deep at cornerback, but it call still run out a pair of former first-team All-Pros in Hanford Dixon and Eric Wright.Class to watch: 2010 If you want a pair of safeties to challenge Lott and Easley, you could do worse than Eric Berry and Earl Thomas, although they've certainly had trouble staying healthy over the past few seasons.This class even has Devin McCourty, Reshad Jones and Kam Chancellor in reserve at safety.Corner isn't quite as impressive, with Joe Haden the only active member of this class to make a Pro Bowl.Worst class: 1979 None of the 47 members of this draft class made a Pro Bowl.It wasn't a great class for defensive backs given that only one went in the first round, but a mere three defensive backs started more than four seasons, and none were drafted before the sixth round.BEST OVERALL CLASSES Third place: 1996 The Keyshawn Johnson-led class has five confirmed Hall of Famers in Harrison, Lewis, Owens, Brian Dawkins and Jonathan Ogden.It could very well justify a sixth, Zach Thomas, and Eddie George and Willie Anderson are long shots who might eventually make it.There's a decent-sized gap between this and the top two drafts, which each have seven Hall of Famers.30 for 30 ESPN's award-winning documentary series.Watch on ESPN+ Second place: 1981 Could you build a defense with LT, Singletary, Lott, Jackson, Easley and Howie Long?That's six defensive Hall of Famers, and you can throw in an offensive lineman with legendary Washington guard Russ Grimm.Dennis Smith might deserve to make it as a six-time Pro Bowler, which would add another honor to the best defensive draft in modern league history.First place: 1983 We started talking about the class of 1983, and we finish talking about the class of 1983.There are seven Hall of Famers, too, but with three quarterbacks in the bunch, this is a more valuable class given the positional scarcity.There's one of the best running backs in league history in Dickerson, an all-time interior lineman and a member of one of the league's most famous families in Bruce Matthews, and a pair of defensive stars in Darrell Green and Richard Dent.There's even a trio of veterans who probably deserve to make it to Canton in Browner and former Broncos draftees Chris Hinton and Karl Mecklenburg.It's incredible to think that we could end up with as many as 10 Hall of Famers from this class one day.Could Cam Newton, who won NFL MVP in 2015, be a Hall of Famer when his career is over?Jeremy Brevard-USA TODAY Sports Class to watch: 2011 It's still way too early to say, of course, but there are four virtually surefire Hall of Famers based on what they've done already in Watt, Miller, Peterson and Sherman.On offense, you would figure that A.J.Green and Julio Jones are on pace to get in, which would get this class to six Hall of Famers.We haven't even gotten to Cam Newton, who has an MVP trophy in his cabinet, and Tyron Smith, who has six consecutive Pro Bowl appearances to his name.Worst class: 1984 Funny how that works, huh?This is one of only two classes from 1970 to 2006 that has failed to produce a Hall of Famer.The 1992 class has one three-time first-team All-Pro in Cowboys safety Darren Woodson.The 1984 class doesn't even sport that level of player.The best players from this class are guys like Wilber Marshall and Boomer Esiason, who don't appear to be close to serious Hall of Fame consideration and who would rate as the 14th- and 15th-best players of the 1983 class.Ten of the 28 first-round picks failed to start even three seasons as a pro.After the bountiful crop of 1983, 1984 amounted to leftovers.
The most exceptional thing the Lakers can do now is hire an outsider:::::Magic Johnson's impromptu news conference before the Los Angeles Lakers' final game of the season Tuesday was another fitting event for an organization consumed with its own narrative.The broadest smile in basketball was stepping down from his position as team president because the job was no fun.Millions of fans would list "running my favorite team" as their dream gig, but Magic's general appraisal of the role is correct.Serving as the senior basketball executive for an NBA team is drudgery.For every LeBron James recruitment, there are a dozen uninspiring tasks, from humdrum transactions to the building of systems in a front office.You can't celebrate the success of a transcendent talent in the sport you love with so much as a tweet without violating some arcane statute of the collective bargaining agreement.When Serena Williams calls, you're reduced to telling her, "Hold on, I've got the NBA's general counsel on the line."Then there's the sheer volume of information management, personnel management -- you even have to manage your general manager.In the end, Magic logically reasoned that he'd rather be a mogul than a hostage.He was so overwhelmed at the prospect of breaking the news to owner Jeanie Buss, that he decided to forgo a one-on-one conversation altogether and instead emote to the assembled media at Staples Center.Buss and the rest of the Lakers' principles learned Johnson resigned when everyone else did.Johnson's choked-up farewell address, in which he said he far preferred being a big brother, was further testimony that family shouldn't always work together.If an employee is so paralyzed by torment at the thought of compromising a professional relationship with a personal choice, chances are he was hired for the wrong reasons at the outset.Though it wasn't the most dignified departure, Johnson's resignation presents Buss with an opportunity to correct her franchise's worst instincts: its lazy fixation on legacy in an era when expertise wins.Before she assembles a list of potential replacements, Buss needs to audit her franchise, which has lost more games than any other NBA team over the past six seasons.She should catalogue its recent successes and failures, and determine its near and long-term goals.But then it's time to look outside: identify a handful of rival NBA organizations she admires, and find out how they go about their business.Editor's Picks The stars, storylines and showdowns you need to know for the NBA playoffs The Eastern Conference will crown a new king.The champs have worthy challengers.A new postseason has arrived, and here's everything you need to get ready.NBA mock draft: Projecting all 60 picks before a big lottery Here are our new projections for both rounds, including a lottery shake-up.1 Related While there's no love lost for the Lakers' front office, Buss carries a fair amount of goodwill around the league.Unlike some of her big-market brethren and sistren, Buss has recognized the plight of the small-market franchise as central to the core mission of the NBA.Her noblesse oblige has conveyed that what's good for the NBA is good for the Lakers, and it's a sentiment that hasn't been lost on fellow owners and executives.Whether it's the San Antonio Spurs, Oklahoma City Thunder or Boston Celtics, Buss should study the anatomy of these organizations, and the philosophies at work.Why have they been successful from a basketball and leadership perspective over a sustained period of time?How are decisions made, and how did these systems and processes originate?How have the Celtics avoided the parochial thinking that has plagued the Lakers even though they installed a franchise legend as their top leader and remain devoted to their past?If history serves as a guide -- and it generally does for the Lakers -- Buss will be tempted to look inside the Lakers' family to fill the leadership void.She could continue to rely on Rob Pelinka, Kobe Bryant's agent and longtime Lakers confidant who has served as general manager for the past two years.Or she could end this recursive cycle now.While the Lakers have been behaving like an insular tribe that bestows power and membership only to those with bloodlines, the rest of the NBA has produced a generation of dynamic managerial talent with diverse skill sets, life experiences and sensibilities.It's a peculiar irony that the one NBA franchise that can make a legitimate pitch to just about anyone has never tapped this vast brain trust.It has never occurred to this massive global brand that sometimes the best leaders for an entity at a moment in time will hail from other places and traditions.It's OK to hire outsiders because building trust with strangers is an important entrepreneurial skill.It might even be good for business.Now that Magic Johnson is gone, will Jeanie Buss keep GM Rob Pelinka for the long haul?Allen Berezovsky/Getty Images There are few top executives in the NBA who won't give the Lakers a listen.If Buss wants to take the temperature of R.C.Buford (San Antonio), Bob Myers (Golden State), Sam Presti (OKC), Masai Ujiri (Toronto), Neil Olshey (Portland) or David Griffin (formerly Cleveland's GM), she has the standing to do so.It's unlikely the Lakers job is attractive to all of them.For instance, no organization reflects its lead executive more than the Thunder reflect Presti, and that's not something he'd be able to replicate in Los Angeles.Buford has little to gain starting over with an organization that's a decade behind the curve.Myers has presided over the most prolific dynasty in a generation with an easy touch, though there's no certainty his existing employer would allow him to be lured away to a rival.Griffin has constructed a championship around LeBron James, which is presumably Buss' aspiration.Ujiri and Olshey are each fluent in every facet of basketball operations from scouting to owner relations, skilled at both messaging and listening, understand the whole of the enterprise, and have achieved consistency in headwind markets.These are just six high-profile names, but all over the league, from Salt Lake to Brooklyn, creative front offices are flourishing.The Clippers might be a source of ridicule in Buss' email correspondences with her courtiers, but if the Lakers' basketball operations department mirrored the Clippers on opening night in 2019, Buss would be in a very strong position.They would be well-equipped to grapple with the multitude of decisions facing this franchise, from talent recruitment this summer, to the handling of an unsettling situation with Brandon Ingram's health, to, most broadly, identifying which of the many routes available to the Lakers is the right one.Hiring an external candidate who has succeeded elsewhere is relatively simple, but empowering the person to install a value structure that might run counter to how you understand the Lakers should be run -- how the Lakers have always been run -- will be a challenge to Buss' inclinations.How it was done with Showtime or Kobe, or how it should be done to someone who feels like family, are no criteria for 2020.LeBron and the Lakers The Lakers' season is over.What's next?How the Lakers wasted Year 1 of LeBron Magic decided it's better just to be Magic Lowe: LeBron vs. MJ implications Is this LeBron's new normal?Whether it's one of those big names, or any number of lesser known young front office thought leaders who would be an upgrade, this individual will install protocols for tasks like free-agent recruitment, standards for hiring folks, player development, the aggregation of information, and other mundane stuff that those who know the Lakers' workings say has been performed on an ad hoc basis for too long.Idle whims or impressions of how a storyline will play in the media won't factor into those systems -- and ownership needs to be entirely comfortable with that.Then there's the matter of LeBron James, who carries enormous gravity as the biggest force in the sport since Michael Jordan.His well-being and performance dictates the mood and success of the team, but Buss must allow any new lead basketball executive to operate under the belief that LeBron, who matters greatly, is temporary in a way in which the Lakers aren't.If Buss decides that her primary objective is setting up the franchise for sustained success five, 10, 15 years down the road rather than a 2020 or 2021 title, a thoughtful front office might conclude that keeping James makes that goal more difficult to obtain.If she's uncomfortable with the prospect of moving James (who can opt out in the summer of 2021) at any point, that's information that must be made clear before she empowers said front office.During the high drama of Magic's departure, the Lakers quietly fired their head trainer, Marco Nunez, on Wednesday.Nunez might have been ill-suited to the job or he might be a medical genius who got a raw deal.As the Lakers consider if or how they want to remake their front office, here are some questions to pose internally about the Nunez firing that could help inform that overall effort: What was the process that inserted him in that role to begin with?How did you measure his talents and potential?What system of oversight did you use in real time to evaluate his medical practices, diagnoses, the rehab protocols he installed, and the return-to-play programs?If you believe that the rash of injuries the Lakers have endured in recent seasons are his fault, how do you know?Is this about process or result?Did you review all that information -- assuming such information exists -- carefully when you decided to fire him, or was the decision a reaction to general frustration in El Segundo about player health?Was this a decision you made because you now know a better way, or was it to service a devotion to a media narrative that says injuries and not organizational failure doomed the 2018-19 Los Angeles Lakers?Finally, if the Lakers' misfortune is the result of hiring the wrong person for the job, what are you going to do differently next time to ensure a different result?
MLB Weekend watch -- Predictions, questions and series to watch:::::Baseball season is really here, and as we settle in to the daily smorgasbord of storylines and matchups, we wanted to help focus your attention this weekend.We've asked three of our writers the key questions about what to watch for and to make some predictions about what's to come.Every Jacob deGrom start has become appointment viewing, and the Mets ace faces the Braves this weekend on Sunday Night Baseball (ESPN, 7 p.m.) What starting pitcher in what season was the most "must-see" of your lifetime?Eddie Matz: With apologies to 1999 Pedro Martinez and 2016 Max Scherzer, I've got to go with Steve Stone in 1980.I mean, I was in fourth grade and in love with the Orioles, and Stone won 25 games back when wins were everything.And don't get me started on that curveball of his.David Schoenfield: In 1985, I was 16 and a Mariners fan, but there was nothing like watching 20-year-old Dwight Gooden make major league hitters look like Oglivie from "Bad News Bears" at the plate.Of course, I lived 3,000 miles from Queens so I didn't exactly get to see Gooden pitch many games that year unless the Mets appeared on the "Game of the Week" or "Monday Night Baseball."(Did "Monday Night Baseball" still exist in 1985?)Is deGrom MLB's undisputed No.1 ace?One the heels of a Cy Young 2018 season, Jacob deGrom has been even better so far in 2019.David Schoenfield That was the year we got cable TV, so I would stay up late to watch the highlights on SportsCenter.Sometimes I would even record the show on VHS tape (ask your parents, kids) just to see how Gooden fared.Otherwise, it was waiting for the box score in the newspaper the next day (ask your parents what a newspaper was as well).And what a season it was: 24-4, 1.53 ERA, 16 complete games and eight shutouts.Somehow, he didn't win MVP honors.Sam Miller: Stephen Strasburg's 2010 stands out.He was 21, arguably the best pitching prospect in baseball history, barely a year out of college, with a 1.30 ERA in the minors and three pitches that all seemed like they might be the best single pitch in the sport.And then he showed up in the majors and was as good as promised: In his major-league debut he struck out 14 and walked nobody, something that only 62 pitchers in history have ever done in any start in their career.(Sandy Koufax, Tom Seaver, Justin Verlander each did it once; Stras did it in his major league debut!)His FIP in 12 starts as a rookie is the 11th best FIP by a starter in my lifetime, his strikeout rate the 18th best.We were watching the greatest pitcher in history, I was sure of it.As with many things we are sure of, I was wrong, but at the time ...The Brewers and Dodgers have cooled a bit after great starts as they square off in a rematch of last year's National League Championship Series.Pick one player from each team whose performance will most determine whether his squad gets back to the NLCS -- or beyond.Matz: Josh Hader.With Jeremy Jeffress on the shelf and Corey Knebel out for the season, the Brewers' bullpen begins and ends with Hader.As for the Dodgers, I don't see them having much of a problem winning the NL West.So really, this question comes down to who has a huge NLDS for them.My spidey senses tell me that it's going to be Kike Hernandez.Games to keep an eye on this weekend Angels at Cubs, Fri., 2 p.m. -- Mike Trout has played only four career games at Wrigley Field.Orioles at Red Sox, Fri., 7:10 p.m. -- Will Chris Davis finally get a hit?White Sox at Yankees, Sat., 1:05 p.m. (ESPN+) -- CC Sabathia makes the first start of his final season.Pirates at Nationals, Sat., 4:05 p.m. -- Max Scherzer faces Chris Archer, who sparked a brawl in his last start.Astros at Mariners, Sat., 9:10 p.m. -- Verlander vs. King Felix not what it used to be, but intriguing nonetheless.Brewers at Dodgers, Sun., 4:10 p.m. -- The finale of a rematch of last year's NLCS.Mets at Braves, Sun., 7 p.m. (ESPN) -- Jacob deGrom.'Nuff said.Schoenfield: Clayton Kershaw is the easy answer for the Dodgers, but it feels like the best answer.The Dodgers are going to score runs and with their rotation depth they can win the division with or without Kershaw, especially given the early train wreck that is the Rockies.But to get to a third straight World Series?That's where Kershaw comes in.For Milwaukee, I'm locked in on Freddy Peralta.Is he a viable option in the rotation?Can he succeed as sub 6-foot right-hander?Can he succeed throwing 80 percent fastballs like he has so far?The early returns are mixed: one not very good start, one of the best starts in Brewers history, one terrible start.Miller: This is probably not literally the answer, but it feels like the right one, so: Kenley Jansen.All indications are that the Dodgers will have a fairly easy path to the postseason, with tons of overlapping parts inoculating them against injuries or underperformance in both the rotation and lineup.But closers aren't always easily replaced, and ninth-inning collapses are (anecdotally, at least) an infection.If you told me the Dodgers somehow won only 84 games this season, I'd bet a bullpen void was a big part of that.If you factor in framing stats, Yasmani Grandal has been as good over the past three or four years as Christian Yelich and Lorenzo Cain.He's famous for his streaks -- and folks tend to focus on the cold ones -- but over the course of the season he should be one of the best hitting catchers in the league, could plausibly erupt for a .900 OPS, and will earn his young pitching staff copious strikes.The prohibitive American League West favorite Astros are in Seattle to face the first-place Mariners.What are the chances these two will be duking it out for the division come September?Matz: Zero.The Astros won't be duking it out with anybody.The only dukery will be between the teams that are fighting for second.If Tim Beckham continues to hit .400 and Domingo Santana keeps up his 200-RBI pace and Marco Gonzales never loses again, then maybe the Mariners weasel their way into a wild card.All that said, I picked the A's to finish second in the West and I'm never, ever changing my mind.(Not yet, anyway.)Schoenfield: Zero?Come on, Eddie, show the M's a little love from the East Coast.The Mashin' Mariners are locked in.Dan Vogelbach is the new Prince Fielder.Mallex Smith and Dee Gordon are the 2019 version of Vince Coleman and Willie McGee (speaking of 1985!).Edwin Encarnacion's parrot loves the Pacific Northwest.If the 2018 A's can push the Astros, maybe the 2019 Mariners can also come out nowhere and do the same.(OK, the Astros won't be duking it out with anybody.)Miller: Does a kite "duke it out" with the wind?From the kite's perspective, maybe, but the Astros are a gale.They will not write books about the 2019 AL West race.Seattle has managed to trim the Astros' chances of winning the division (according to Baseball Prospectus' playoff odds) from 89 percent to 88, so we can award the Mariners "Kite of the Month" or whatever.When considering this weekend's schedule, what's the one thing -- a game, an individual matchup, anything -- you most want to see?Matz: Snellzilla takes Toronto.Last season, Blake Snell dominated the Blue Jays.OK, so he dominated everyone, but the reigning Cy Young was especially lethal against the Jays, posting a 0.54 ERA with 27 K's in 16 innings.Against a 2019 Toronto team that's at or near the bottom of pretty much every offensive category so far, anything is possible.Heck, maybe Snell even gets his first career complete game.Why the Rays are MLB's most exciting team With a load of young talent, a Cy Young-winning stud and innovative management, Tampa Bay is the underdog team everyone should keep an eye on.David Schoenfield Schoenfield: Astros at Mariners, of course!This will be a tougher test for the Mariners than the White Sox or Royals (or lowly Red Sox).Seattle actually won the season series from Houston last year, 10-9.Miller: This early in the season, it's especially fun to see the range of outcomes for high-variance starting pitchers (those who are young, who have seemed to be breaking out, who are returning from surgeries, who have incredible stuff/shaky control) begin to narrow.So I'm looking forward to Friday's slate of starters: Jose Urias, Zack Wheeler and Chris Paddack, all of whom contain real ace potential and a bunch of unresolved questions.PICK 'EM TIME Last weekend, Mike Trout's OPS posted a ridiculous 2.631 OPS against the Rangers, the third-highest ever for a four-game series.This weekend Trout and the Angels have a three-game set with the Cubs at Wrigley Field.Trout's OPS this weekend: Over or under 1.850?Matz: As bad as Cubs pitchers have been this season (worst in the NL), no opposing hitter has recorded an OPS that high against them.Not even Christian Yelich.The closest was Ozzie Albies, who posted a 1.667.All of which is to say, 1.850 is a really high number for anyone -- even Trout.I'll take the under.Schoenfield: Under.But a good under as he goes 0-for-0 with 14 walks for a mere 1.000 OPS.Miller: Under, because no matter how much you like a guy, 1.850 is ridiculous.In his best year, Barry Bonds' OPS on three-ball counts was only 1.700.We should have picked a lower number.Three of baseball's best starters take the hill this weekend: Max Scherzer vs. Pittsburgh, Blake Snell at Toronto, Jacob deGrom at Atlanta.Total runs allowed by Scherzer, Snell and deGrom: Over or under 5.5?Matz: Trick question.Scherzer might not start after getting drilled in the leg by a liner in his last outing.Under, please.Schoenfield: Under.Miller: Snell's going to take a no-hitter into the seventh.Under.What's your pick for Sunday night's game -- the Mets, with deGrom coming off his first bad start in a millenium, or the Braves and their young studs?Matz: It's Max Fried's last start before Passover begins.I'm not exactly sure what that means, but as history has shown us time and again (and most recently in the last World Baseball Classic), never bet against the Jewish people.Braves, please.Schoenfield: I love what Max Fried has done his past two starts, but that win against Colorado came against a lineup that more resembled the Albuquerque Isotopes than the Rockies.I'll take the Mets.Miller: Mets.TWO TRUE OUTCOMES Each week, we'll ask our panelists to choose one hitter they think will hit the most home runs and one pitcher they think will record the most strikeouts in the coming weekend.Panelists can pick a player only once for the season.We'll keep a running tally -- and invite you to play along at home.HOME RUN HITTERS Matz: J.D.Martinez Miller: Tommy Pham Schoenfield: Aaron Judge STRIKEOUT PITCHERS Matz: Blake Snell Miller: Justin Verlander Schoenfield: Dwight Gooden ... err, Gerrit Cole
How the amazing Mariners are playing like baseball's best team:::::KANSAS CITY, Mo.-- In the simple telling of this beyond-real Seattle Mariners story, Daniel Vogelbach plays the large adult son.He stands 6-foot, with the round face of a South Park character, the torso of a quarter-barrel keg and the goofy countenance of Chris Farley.He swings his bat with vigor and hits baseballs extraordinarily hard.Vogelbach is easy to love and easier to stereotype.He is, in those ways and many more, a microcosm of his team.All it takes to see the real Vogelbach, the one who shall not be reduced to a cartoon, is a trip to the Mariners' clubhouse on a Thursday morning.It's 9 o'clock, nearly seven hours before Vogelbach will hit a go-ahead home run in extra innings to win another game for the Mariners.Most of baseball is asleep.Seattle's veterans are hopping the second bus from the team hotel.Vogelbach moseys over to an empty seat, plops in front of a computer and starts to watch video.And then he watches more video.And when he has had enough, he points and clicks some more.It is not an accident that Vogelbach, 26, seemingly a big leaguer for good after destroying minor league pitching seven years running, has carved out a place on this record-setting Mariners team -- the one with a 13-2 record, home runs in all 15 of its games and playoff aspirations in what was supposed to be a rebuilding year.He may look like a meathead.In truth, he's a complete egghead.Vogelbach's memory for baseball minutiae is encyclopedic.He knows what pitchers throw, how the pitches spin, their movement profiles.He knows how they will pitch him.He knows this because he's self-aware enough to understand how baseball people discount him because of his body and foot speed and all the gifts he wasn't given.So he must be smarter.He must work harder.He must approach baseball with the reverence and respect something so difficult warrants.The state of baseball in 2019 From labor talks and new rules to some different spending habits, it was an unsettling offseason.So where does the game stand as a new campaign begins?Jeff Passan "It's not an easy game," Vogelbach says."You can't take any days off, for granted.It's just trying every day to come in.You're not always going to get hits, but at least you can control your at-bats.If you're not feeling it, you can battle, grind at-bats out.In an 0-for-4, you can still do things to help your team win.I'm a firm believer in that."Every time I get in the box, it's a refreshing moment.You control what you can control."What he's controlling is practically everything, though particularly the strike zone.And that is the hub of this remarkable 15-game run by the Mariners: the not-so-novel-but-supremely-novel-to-them talking point of controlling the zone.Manager Scott Servais preaches it like he's a minister and the 17-inch-wide plate is his pulpit.Jay Bruce and Edwin Encarnacion, two of the new-look Mariners' offseason additions, are his evangelists -- Bruce via word throughout the clubhouse, Encarnacion via action in-game.And the rest of the congregants -- Vogelbach and Domingo Santana and Tim Beckham and Ryon Healy and Dee Gordon and Mallex Smith -- are just happy to embody the gospel on the way to 117 runs scored and a staggering plus-42 run differential."You're always trying to get better," Servais says."I know I am.Continuous improvement is one of the things we've talked about.Kaizen.Have you ever heard about kaizen?"Kaizen is the Japanese business tenet of continuous improvement -- of increasing productivity through streamlined processes.Servais is a fan of leadership books, and when he read Masaki Imai's 1986 tome about kaizen this offseason, he believed its ability to improve all aspects of a business, from management to rank-and-file, could benefit a Mariners team that traded away its best pitcher (James Paxton), its star closer (Edwin Diaz), its high-priced second baseman (Robinson Cano) and other core players.The Mariners rebuilt their offense with the intent of bullying pitchers.In the past, the advance reports given to hitters before the game consisted of the velocity range of opponents' pitches and the movement patterns.This season, Seattle installed a pair of analysts in the clubhouse to serve as conduits for much deeper information.It's no longer merely opposing pitchers' stuff.Mariners hitters are essentially given game-planning techniques -- not just what pitchers throw but what they throw that gets hit hard.The Mariners' Daniel Vogelbach celebrates after his 10th-inning home run Thursday capped Seattle's comeback win and raised his OPS to 1.133.Denny Medley/USA TODAY Sports "It's more sophisticated, but it's actually simpler, if that makes any sense," says Mitch Haniger, the longest-tenured active Mariners hitter who, like Vogelbach, is a deeply analytical and thoughtful hitter."You're getting more information, but they're telling you exactly where to focus to do damage."It has manifested itself in myriad ways.This goes beyond the simple patience they've shown.Yes, Mariners hitters are swinging at just 23.7 percent of pitches outside the strike zone, per ESPN Stats & Information research, the fifth lowest rate in baseball.And a year after seeing 3.79 pitches per plate appearance, they're at 4.06 this year.Now is perhaps the best time for the small-sample caveat.Fifteen games do not a season make.But it's the second-level statistics that are truly indicative of a team with deep improvements: When Mariners hitters are behind in counts (0-1, 0-2 and 1-2), they've swung at just 43.7 percent of pitches, well below the MLB average of nearly 50 percent.Their patience does not wane in stressful situations."No one's wasting any at-bats," Beckham says."But it's early.There are 150 more games to go.We haven't accomplished anything."Let's not go that far.The Mariners are only the 17th team since the turn of the 20th century to start a season at least 13-2.Only three other teams in the wild-card era have done so: the 2018 Red Sox, who won the World Series, and the 2013 Braves and 2003 Giants, both of whom made the playoffs.The Mariners' 36 home runs are tied for the most ever through 15 games, and their 117 runs rank second.Baseball Tonight podcast with Buster Olney ESPN's Buster Olney leads the discussion of the latest news and notes around baseball with the game's top analysts.Listen The individual numbers are equally staggering.Gordon, an inveterate free swinger, is chasing on just 20 percent of outside pitches.Beckham, the former No.1 overall pick, is walking nearly twice as much as ever, in close to 14 percent of his plate appearances.Bruce has seven home runs in 13 games, nearly matching his total from last season with the Mets.Santana and Encarnacion, also acquired in trades, are putting up matching .300/.400/.500 slash lines from the Nos.3 and 4 holes.Nobody is surprising quite like Vogelbach.The Chicago Cubs took him in the second round of the 2011 draft, when he weighed upward of 300 pounds.They believed the bat would play.And it did.Vogelbach always hit.It wasn't enough.In July 2016, Chicago shipped him to Seattle for Mike Montgomery, who closed out Game 7 of the World Series for the Cubs.Vogelbach debuted and struggled, returned in 2017 and struggled again and didn't do much in 102 plate appearances last year, either.The up-and-down tends to wear on analytical types, to whom routine is religion.On April 2, in the Mariners' eighth game of the year, Vogelbach hit his first home run.In their next game, he hit another.Two days later, two more.A day after that, another.And on Thursday came his sixth homer in 39 plate appearances, one that raised his batting average to .400, his on-base percentage to .513, his slugging percentage to 1.133 and his cult-hero status to the point where Sub Pop should be offering him a record deal any day."It's not gonna last.I understand that," Vogelbach says."I try not to ride that roller coaster.If you can stay even-keeled the whole time, through the ups and downs, at the end of the year you'll be where you want to be."And that's the tack the Mariners are trying to take with this success.Vogelbach knows he's not going to hit .588 on pitches in the strike zone, no matter how much he controls it.He realizes that he probably won't finish the season second in the major leagues in average exit velocity behind Aaron Judge.He understands that for the Mariners to be taken seriously, they must improve on their league-worst defense, which has committed 21 errors, and that their pitching, iffy at best on paper, must overachieve.He recognizes that if the Mariners' offense really wants some respect on its name, an upcoming three-game stretch could mean even more than the 15 already in the books.On Saturday night, they host Justin Verlander.On Sunday afternoon, it's Gerrit Cole.And on Monday night, Trevor Bauer.That's three consecutive games against the Nos.2, 5 and 6 finishers in the American League Cy Young voting last season.It's not a litmus test as much as it is a final at the end of an incredibly successful term.Can these Seattle Mariners do what they've done thus far against the best of the best?Is their ability to control the zone something they possess against all calibers of pitchers?Has their kaizen taken them beyond mere novelty and to legitimate AL West threat?Vogey has an answer to that, much as he has everything thrown his way in 2019.When Vogelbach arrived in the big leagues, Kyle Seager, the Mariners' longest-tenured player, told him to give every player respect but take the name off the back of his opponents' jerseys.It's the same game no matter who's pitching, Seager said, so there's no sense in adding pressure by assigning any more import to Verlander or Cole or Bauer or anyone else.He appreciates that it's not an easy game, not one you take for granted and that the Seattle Mariners, the best team nobody expected, will control only what they can control, which, at least so far, is plenty.
Stanley Cup Playoffs Daily:::::Mitchell Marner knocks in two goals, the second off a penalty shot, to lead the Maple Leafs to a 4-1 win over the Bruins.(0:33) The current playoff format just isn't fair, because a legitimate Stanley Cup contender like the Boston Bruins must play a powerhouse team in Round 1 like the... Toronto Maple Leafs?Toronto played a complete game to knock down the Bruins at home in Game 1, though this series is far from over; we're still predicting a slugfest.Meanwhile, the defending Cup champs survived a late scare in their opener, and the Calgary Flames blanked the Colorado Avalanche.Here's a recap of last night's action -- check out replays of every playoff game on ESPN+ -- and a look at what to watch for tonight, in today's edition of ESPN Stanley Cup Playoffs Daily.Jump ahead: Last night's games | Three Stars Play of the night | Tonight's games | Social post of the day About last night... Game 1: Toronto Maple Leafs 4, Boston Bruins 1.The Maple Leafs haven't won the first game of a playoff series since 2003."I did not know that," said John Tavares, who was 12 years old at the time, and does not remember whether he stayed up to watch.Tavares had a goal and assist, Mitch Marner scored twice (including a slick penalty shot) and Frederik Andersen looked solid as Toronto silenced the Bruins' mighty top line plus a sold-out crowd to steal home-ice advantage.Game 1: Washington Capitals 4, Carolina Hurricanes 2.The Caps showed that 3-0 is not the worst lead in hockey (too soon, Lightning fans?)as they sealed a 4-2 victory over the Canes -- despite a late push and two third-period goals from Carolina rookie Andrei Svechnikov.Carolina was playing in its first playoff game in a decade; the last time the Hurricanes were here, the Black Eyed Peas' "Boom Boom Pow" was the No.1 song in America.Unfortunately, the Canes didn't have an answer for Washington's power play, which went 2-for-4.Game 1: Calgary Flames 4, Colorado Avalanche 0.On a team so stocked with firepower -- five players had 70-plus point seasons -- it was rookie Andrew Mangiapane who opened the scoring with a beauty in the second period.Welcome to the show, kid.Matthew Tkachuk scored two goals, but the real star was goaltender Mike Smith, who dazzled while pitching a shutout.play 0:23 Mangiapane puts the Flames on top Andrew Mangiapane scores in front of the net to put the Flames up 1-0 in the second period.Three Stars 1.Mike Smith, G, Calgary Flames.In his first playoff game in seven years, the 37-year-old shined.Smith turned away all 26 shots -- and even notched an assist on the empty-net goal.Goaltending was a big question mark for the Flames entering the playoffs; it was unclear if Smith would even start this game, or if they'd go with David Rittich.If the Flames continue to get performances like this in net, they really are the favorites in the West.2.Frederik Andersen, G, Toronto Maple Leafs.Yes, Marner got two goals and should be recognized.But if the Maple Leafs are going to advance, they'll need more nights like this from Andersen.He looked confident.He weathered bursts of pressure.He did it all in a hostile environment.By turning away 37 of 38 shots, Andersen was a huge boost for Toronto.3.Nicklas Backstrom, C, Washington Capitals.The Caps didn't get a shot on goal for nearly 10 minutes in their opening game against the Canes.Then Backstrom got hot.Like, really hot.He scored twice (accounting for two of Washington's first four shots) and the rest of the team woke up, building a 3-0 lead by the end of the first period.Play of the night Late in the second period, with the Maple Leafs holding onto a 2-1 lead, Nazem Kadri got the puck in his own zone.He looked up to a see a streaking William Nylander by the opposite blue line.Kadri slung the puck between two Boston defenders to hit Nylander in stride.The result?A gorgeous cross-ice connection and breakaway goal for Nylander."When you look at it in slow-mo and in instant replay, you overanalyze it a bit," Kadri says."But in the time, I just saw him open and gave it to him."Sick pass by Kadri springs Nylander on the breakaway pic.twitter.com/CK1a58tvRv - Pete Blackburn (@PeteBlackburn) April 12, 2019 Dud of the night It wasn't the best night for Boston goalie Tuukka Rask, and he was totally fooled on Marner's penalty shot, which swung the game's momentum."That was a [David Pastrnak] move, he's done that in practice," Rask said, acknowledging that, yeah, it was a good move, but the veteran goaltender shouldn't have looked so stunned.What's on the schedule tonight?Game 2: Columbus Blue Jackets at Tampa Bay Lightning, 7 p.m.ET.Columbus leads the series, 1-0.Columbus erased a three-goal deficit to defeat the (heavy Stanley Cup favorite) Lightning in Game 1.If the Blue Jackets take Game 2, they would be poised for one of the biggest NHL playoff upsets of all time.And is anyone prepared to see John Tortorella... in a good mood?Game 2: Pittsburgh Penguins at New York Islanders, 7:30 p.m.ET.New York leads the series, 1-0.The Nassau Coliseum was rocking on Wednesday as the Islanders look to capitalize on their first home-ice advantage in a playoff series since 1988.The typically offensively challenged Isles scored enough goals (four) to keep up with -- and defeat -- the Penguins in overtime in Game 1.Game 2: St. Louis Blues at Winnipeg Jets, 9:30 p.m.ET.St. Louis leads the series, 1-0.Some relief for Winnipeg?Patrik Laine netted a goal in Game 1; the Finnish sniper is a streaky goal scorer and is looking to get on track after a so-so season.But that was all the offense the Jets could muster past rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington.For the Blues, hometown boy Patrick Maroon (who set up the game-winning goal) is heating up at the right time.Game 2: Vegas Golden Knights at San Jose Sharks, 10:30 p.m.ET.San Jose leads the series, 1-0.The Sharks ended the season in a slump, but maybe all they needed was a little puck luck -- as in, the puck fortuitously bouncing off captain Joe Pavelski's jaw and deflecting past Marc-Andre Fleury.San Jose got plenty of opportunities in a 5-2 opening win and the Golden Knights, according to coach Gerard Gallant, were "outplayed" in every facet, not even generating a shot for the first five minutes.They'll need a better start in Game 2.News bulletin The Golden Knights could be getting reinforcements.Russian forward Nikita Gusev, the reigning MVP of the KHL, is reportedly working to get out of his contract with SKA St. Petersburg early to join Vegas as soon as this week.(SKA was eliminated in the conference finals of the Gagarin Cup playoffs).The skilled and speedy Gusev, 26, is on the Golden Knights' reserve list and is eligible to play in the postseason.Gusev was also recently named the training camp roster for Team Russia for May's World Championships in Slovakia.So if he doesn't make it to Vegas for the playoffs, you can catch him in action there.Social post of the day I screamed at my tv pic.twitter.com/3QtJg9bqpg - Manny (@mannyelk) April 12, 2019 The Canes might want to clean this up before Game 2.Just saying.Quotable "Honestly I've never heard anything like that before in my career," Mike Smith, on hearing the crowd in Calgary chant "Smitty" during his epic opening-night performance.
How Blues rookie Jordan Binnington refused to take a career defeat:::::The Blues score two goals in the 3rd period to edge out the Jets 2-1 in Game 1.(0:29) It's Game 1 of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the St. Louis Blues, and rookie goaltender Jordan Binnington is standing in the middle of a madhouse.The Bell MTS Centre in Winnipeg provides one of the NHL's most raucous home-ice advantages, as generations of Jets-obsessed Manitobans assemble in white shirts to turn the arena into an alabaster cauldron every postseason.Many veteran goaltenders have entered it and melted down under the combined intensity of the crowd and the Jets' offense, which generated 71 more goals at home than it did on the road over the past two seasons.Binnington is the antithesis of a veteran.This wasn't just his first game in Winnipeg, but his first playoff game in the NHL.The Jets decided to not only test him with shots on goal, but with shots of a cheaper variety.Just 26 seconds into the game, Binnington played the puck to a teammate and was skating back to his crease when Winnipeg star Mark Scheifele absolutely trucked him, knocking him to the ice and earning a goalie interference penalty."It's playoff hockey.I can take a hit.We're going to stay composed and keep working," Binnington recalled thinking.2019 Stanley Cup playoffs Miss a game from the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs?Want to experience it again?Every playoff game is available for replay on ESPN+.Watch now The work continued after Patrik Laine opened the scoring at 13 minutes, 28 seconds of the first period.The crowd was ecstatic.The Jets were flying.If ever a rookie goalie was going to melt down in his first playoff game, the conditions were right.And then Binnington didn't allow another goal in Game 1, as the Blues completed a 2-1 win.He even got his comeuppance on Scheifele, stretching his pad over to take away a gaping net from the Jets center in the last moments of the third period."I just had to make a little desperation save there.The boys came in and cleared out the rebound.We were happy with that," Binnington said."That was cool.Canadian city.Passionate fans."Passionate media, too.On the day of the game, Mike McIntyre of the Winnipeg Free Press wrote about some tweets from 2013 that had garnered Binnington criticism online.Like when a 19-year-old Binnington tweeted: "I was thinking.when people who wear the burkas are at the airport how is the security able to see if that's them in their passport...Srsly."He followed that thought with "also If you're underage & nervous of getting into a bar, throw the damn burka on.no way the bouncer will get into that awkward questioning."In a story titled "Controversial tweets from Blues goaltender come to light," McIntyre wondered "whether or not Binnington [will be] brought out to speak about this issue remains to be seen, as teams often have a policy of shielding their starter on game days."Jordan Binnington closed out the regular season with a 24-5-1 record, 1.89 goals-against average and a .927 save percentage.Keith Gillett/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Binnington would, in fact, speak about it on the day of Game 1."It was a while ago when I was a teenager.It was a little sarcasm and joking around.That's what life is about, you live and learn and you grow as a human.I'm just here to play a couple hockey games," he said.Across Canada, his friend and former goalie coach Greg Redquest of the Owen Sound Attack heard about the controversy.He was unsurprised to see his protg address the issue head-on, even before the biggest game of his life."He would want to get it out there, and get it right.That if he offended anyone, he was sorry.That he didn't mean to offend.I know him better than anybody, and he's not that kind of person," he said.So what kind of person is Jordan Binnington?He's somehow both a study in humility and extreme self-assurance, a 25-year-old goalie that's put together a masterful (if truncated) rookie campaign to lead the Blues from the Western Conference basement to a spot in the playoffs.A player who waited years for his number to be called, and is now doing everything he can to keep the crease, because he believes he should."Most goalies are good.You just have to deal with their head.If you think you're good, you're going to be really good," Redquest said."In St. Louis, the mindset for him was that if one door was shut, another one would open eventually.And it did.He kept on battling and battling until he finally got a shot at it."Redquest met a 16-year-old Jordan Binnington in 2009, his rookie year in the Ontario Hockey League."You could just tell when you first got him that he was outstanding.A lot of confidence.Great technical goalie.He did what he had to do to stop the puck," said Redquest, who appeared in one game with the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1977-78 season and has been the Owen Sound goalie coach for about a decade now."We knew back then that he'd be really good.You don't have many kids playing in the OHL at 16 years old.He was a big boy, but his feet movement was unbelievable.I didn't have to teach him anything.I just tweaked it.He stays between the posts.Never overplays anything.He never makes anything look hard.Good goalies make hard shots look easy, and that's what he does."The 2010-11 season was his pinnacle, leading the Attack to the John Ross Robertson Cup as OHL champion with an overtime win, and securing a spot in the Memorial Cup tournament.Owen Sound was the underdog.Binnington came to the rescue with the team down 3-1 in the series to the Windsor Spitfires.After winning the OHL title, Binnington displayed some of that swagger that has defined him.He searched out Redquest from the ice, turned to him, and mimicked placing a WWE championship belt around his waist.The two remained close after Binnington was drafted No.88 overall in the third round of the 2011 NHL draft by the Blues.How close were they?In-game food delivery close."I remember one time I was in a private box near the ice at one of his [OHL] games.He went by me and made this motion with his hands, like he was eating chicken wings, a signal that was like, 'I'm hungry right now.'So I grabbed some chicken wings from the private box, took them down to him between periods.He ate all of them," he recalled with a laugh."Still got first star in that game."But good times in junior hockey became frustrating years in the American Hockey League.He lingered in the minor leagues from 2013 through this season, save for one injury emergency game with the Blues in the 2015-16 season.Most of his time was spent with the Chicago Wolves of the AHL."Guys love playing for him.They'll go through the wall for him.He's got that personality.He's an unbelievable teammate, and very humble," said Stan Dubicki, his goalie coach in Chicago."There were times he dropped on the depth chart, but he never lost confidence."And there was that one time he just said "no."Binnington's calmness in the face of pressure is not surprising to those who know him best.Keith Gillett/Icon Sportswire Martin Brodeur met Binnington when the Blues acquired the Hockey Hall of Fame goalie in 2014, playing seven games before retiring to join the team's hockey operations department.That's when he really got to know Binnington."I think I sent him down to the minors three times.Like, directly.And I'd see the look on his face and it was like, 'Seriously?'He thought he belonged [in the NHL].That's a great trait to have, that confidence," Brodeur said.In 2017, Binnington refused to take a step back in his career when the Blues asked him to take a demotion to the ECHL, because the team was sharing a minor league affiliation with the Vegas Golden Knights and didn't have a roster spot for him in Chicago."The year they tried to send him to the East Coast league, he refused to go.He said, 'I'm not an East Coast goalie.I'm better than that.'Another one of his goalie coaches found him a spot in Providence and that was fantastic.He thought he was ready to be a pro.He stuck to his guns, bless his heart, and said he wasn't going down," Redquest said."The kid had it.It's frustrating when you see goalies that you're better than playing in the NHL full time and you're not.He was toe-to-toe with John Gibson of Anaheim in junior.On any day, one was as good as the other, but Gibson only played one or two years in the minors.Pheonix Copley was his goalie partner in Chicago.He was in the NHL, and Binner was sitting in [the minors]."So he told the Blues that he refused to report if demoted to the ECHL.He went home to Richmond Hill, Ontario, and waited for the process to play out.The remedy was to have Binnington play with the AHL Providence Bruins on loan.It was something that changed the trajectory of his career.Binnington started 10-1-0 for the P-Bruins, and finished the season at 17-9-0 with a .926 save percentage.After that season, he entered Blues camp the following September expecting that he could compete for an NHL job.But even with the departure of both Brian Elliott and Carter Hutton during his time in the organization, Binnington remained buried on the depth chart behind starter Jake Allen, free-agent acquisition Chad Johnson and Ville Husso, a prospect they held in higher regard than Binnington."He was frustrated.He came to camp, he was ready, and he got one period of an exhibition game.But they told him that he wasn't in their plans," Redquest said.Binnington was 25 years old.He felt he was NHL-ready.He returned to the AHL and dominated for the San Antonio Rampage -- 11-4-0, .927 save percentage -- while watching the Blues stumble out of the gate with very ordinary goaltending, eventually firing their head coach, Mike Yeo.He watched.He waited.He needed a break.Jordan Binnington has Blues fans pondering a long run in the playoffs.Scott Rovak/NHLI via Getty Images Brodeur remembers his break.In 1993, the Devils had traded goalie Craig Billington to Ottawa for Peter Sidorkiewicz, who was expected to back up starter Chris Terreri.Except Sidorkiewicz had a bum shoulder, limiting him to just three games that season."I stole his job.If he comes in healthy, I don't even have a sniff of the NHL yet," Brodeur said."It's the same thing with Binnington.If Husso doesn't get hurt, or have a slow start, Binnington's not up.Husso's up, because he's the better prospect.Certain guys can just grab it when it's time.You have to be ready when that chance comes."The chance came when Johnson was put on waivers and Binnington was called up on Dec. 10, 2018.His first start came on Jan. 1, a victory over the Philadelphia Flyers.Then another against Montreal.Then a third against Dallas, having given up just two goals in his first three starts.By Feb. 19, he was 13-1-1, having helped resurrect the Blues from the bottom of the conference to a playoff seed.By season's end, he had played himself into rookie of the year consideration with a 24-5-1 record in 32 appearances, with a .927 save percentage and an NHL-best 1.89 goals-against average."Nobody knows what happened, but it happened pretty good, though," Brodeur said with a laugh.In The Crease Postgame analysis and highlight show airing each night throughout the season from Barry Melrose and Linda Cohn.Watch on ESPN+ Dubicki wasn't surprised."He just needed an opportunity.The game's a little bit quicker at the NHL level and he's got the speed to do it.Quick-thinking goalie, great reaction, incredible flexibility," he said."He's been such a talented kid, for a long time.Just making the most of his chance."Redquest and Binnington talk frequently, including after his Game 1 win.He knew that the rookie would make a quick impact in St. Louis when given the crease."He was the spark they needed in that room.He's so positive.Everybody loves him," he said."You just want to be around him because he's a happy person.He makes you feel better about yourself."Sometimes these things take a while for goaltenders.And when the waiting stops, the right goaltenders seize the moment."I don't think we made the mistake.I think the whole league made the mistake.He's a late bloomer," Brodeur said."If you make it at 25, that means you really, really want it.If you're a guy that was given everything at a young age, like you're a prodigy, and it hasn't happened yet when you're 25, you probably want to quit.In your mind, everything falls apart for you.But that second- or third-rounder who needs to grind, keep looking for that chance ... good things will happen to you.A lot of goalies, they're either not committed to do that or they don't get a break."Binnington got his break, never wavering in his conviction that he could thrive when it arrived, even when he was buried on the depth chart or in the minor leagues.It's the journey that makes him savor this.It's the journey that keeps him modest."Every day in this league is incredible.I'm very humbled to play up here," he said.
College football spring games -- How to watch, what to expect:::::This weekend's spring game slate features a number of prominent football programs ready to answer some of our burning questions.Here are our suggestions on what to scout for and keep an eye on this weekend, and how to watch your team.Jump to a conference: ACC| Big 12 | Big Ten | Pac-12 SEC | American | FBS Independent Spring Game reading ACC Pittsburgh Panthers 1 p.m.ET What we're excited to see: It's doubtful Pitt will offer much in the way of flourishes on its prototypical run-first attack, but it will be interesting to see whether the Panthers continue to showcase more spread formations -- as they've done throughout the spring -- now that fullback George Aston and tailbacks Darrin Hall and Qadree Ollison have moved on.Make no mistake: Pitt is still a ground-and-pound offense, but there could be some nuance to the approach this year, starting in the spring game.- David M. Hale Syracuse Orange 1:30 p.m.ET What we're excited to see: The Orange made huge strides last season, finishing the year ranked and with 10 wins for the first time in nearly two decades.Whether they can continue the climb and challenge for the ACC Atlantic crown likely depends on how good new starting QB Tommy DeVito will be in 2019.DeVito, a former ESPN 300 recruit, got his share of playing time last season.But this is still new terrain, and the spring game offers a first glimpse into what Syracuse's offense will look like with him leading the charge.- David M. Hale Virginia Tech Hokies 4 p.m.ET What we're excited to see: The Hokies have evenly split their quarterback reps among Ryan Willis, Quincy Patterson and Hendon Hooker this spring, and coach Justin Fuente has been mum on who has the edge to start.But the bigger story might be the defense, coming off the worst season under coordinator Bud Foster.Eleven starters return, and rising star Dax Hollifield has slimmed down and feels much quicker.Definite progress has been made, but a complete transformation might be in order to get the Hokies to compete for another Coastal Division title.- Andrea Adelson Big 12 Baylor Bears 1 p.m.ET, Fox Sports Southwest What we're excited to see: The upstart Bears could quietly have one of the top offenses in the Big 12 behind junior quarterback Charlie Brewer, who passed for 3,000 yards last season.Several of Baylor's top returning playmakers are sitting out the spring game.That will give running backs Trestan Ebner and Abram Smith and wideouts Jared Atkinson and R.J. Sneed the chance to show Brewer they can fuel the Baylor arsenal.- Jake Trotter Kansas Jayhawks 7 p.m.ET, ESPN+ What we're excited to see: Les Miles is back in college football, and he has Kansas fans stoked ... about football.Yes, football.It's been a physical spring practice for the Jayhawks, and one question yet to be answered is who the starting quarterback will be.Carter Stanley is the holdover, and Thomas MacVittie is the junior college newcomer.They're competing for the starting job and doing so with a new system that includes run-pass-option (RPO) elements.The big treat might be seeing Miles' dance moves to the beat of rap star Rick Ross after the spring game.- Chris Low Kansas State Wildcats 2 p.m.ET What we're excited to see: The legendary Bill Snyder era is finally over in Manhattan, clearing the way for new coach Chris Klieman to put his mark on the program.Klieman won with overlooked players -- as Snyder did for so many years -- while dominating the FCS at North Dakota State.So in many ways, the Wildcats will look the same.Still, the spring showcase will provide a glimpse into how K-State might be different going forward.- Jake Trotter Oklahoma Sooners 8:30 p.m.ET, Friday, Fox Sports Oklahoma What we're excited to see: All eyes will be on quarterback Jalen Hurts, who will make his public debut in a new shade of red for the first time.Hurts, who went 26-2 as a starter at Alabama, is among the most high-profile transfers in recent college football history.If he can improve on his passing efficiency in Lincoln Riley's Air Raid attack, the Sooners will be a serious threat to reach the College Football Playoff for the fourth time in five years.- Jake Trotter Texas Longhorns 7:30 p.m.ET, Longhorn Network What we're excited to see: Tom Herman is looking for more explosive playmakers on offense, and the Longhorns might have them in a pair of freshmen: running back Jordan Whittington and receiver Bru McCoy should be fun to watch, as should redshirt freshman receiver Malcolm Epps, who's emerging as a weapon for the Horns.-- Sam Khan Jr. West Virginia Mountaineers 1 p.m.ET, WVUsports.com What we're excited to see: Not only do the Mountaineers have a new coach in Neal Brown but they'll have a new quarterback as well.Leading the pack to succeed Will Grier is Oklahoma transfer Austin Kendall, who finally has the chance to show what he can do after sitting behind Heisman Trophy winners Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray in Norman.- Jake Trotter Big Ten Illinois Fighting Illini 2:00 p.m.ET What we're excited to see: Last season, the Illini defense gave up an average of 508.3 yards per game, which was good for third worst of any FBS team behind Oregon State and UConn.Have they improved?Additions include Washington transfer linebacker Milo Eifler, and there are some younger players looking to step up and help.Linebackers Shammond Cooper and Dele Harding should be in that conversation as well as Delano Ware, who was moved from safety to linebacker.Improving the defense is going to be crucial for the upcoming season's success.- Tom VanHaaren Indiana Hoosiers Friday, 7:00 p.m.ET, Big Ten N What we're excited to see: Head coach Tom Allen, looking to get more out of the offense, brought in new offensive coordinator Kalen DeBoer from Fresno State.The unit received good news when it found out Utah quarterback transfer Jack Tuttle was granted immediate eligibility from the NCAA, but a short-term sickness will keep him sidelined for the spring game.With or without Tuttle in for the spring game, it will still be interesting to see what the tweaked offense will look like with DeBoer in charge.- Tom VanHaaren Michigan Wolverines 5 p.m.ET What we're excited to see: Offensive coordinator Josh Gattis says he has installed 90 percent of the team's new playbook.While most of that will remain under wraps until September, Gattis said viewers will get a feel for how the huddle-free, up-tempo version of the offense might breathe some fresh air into the 2019 Wolverines.- Dan Murphy Minnesota Golden Gophers Noon ET What we're excited to see: Minnesota's quarterback competition will spill into preseason camp, although fans can scout Tanner Morgan and Zack Annexstad in Saturday's game.It's also a chance to see an offensive line featuring Daniel Faalele, the 6-foot-9, 400-pound Australian, and the competition at left tackle between Jason Dickson and Sam Schlueter.Star receiver Tyler Johnson did this at last year's spring game, and more highlights could be on the way.- Adam Rittenberg Nebraska Cornhuskers 2 p.m.ET, Big Ten Network What we're excited to see: How much the defense has improved.Yes, fans go to spring games to see offense, but Nebraska won't contend in the West Division without an improved defense.Lineman Darrion Daniels, a transfer from Oklahoma State, has impressed this spring.Nebraska also seems to have more versatility, with Cam Taylor, JoJo Domann and others."I'm not saying that we're the Tampa Bay Bucs with Warren Sapp and the boys yet," defensive coordinator Erik Chinander said, "but we're moving in the right direction."- Adam Rittenberg Ohio State Buckeyes 12 p.m.ET, Big Ten Network What we're excited to see: The debuts of head coach Ryan Day and quarterback Justin Fields are certain to garner a lot of attention this weekend.Don't forget to check out what's happening on the other side of the ball for a defense with a brand-new coaching staff after some underwhelming performances in 2018.- Dan Murphy Penn State Nittany Lions 3:00 p.m.ET What we're excited to see: The Nittany Lions are going to need some of the younger players to step up and take on bigger roles in 2019.On defense, linebacker Micah Parsons led the team in tackles and has an opportunity to take the next step in 2019.Parsons, along with Jesse Luketa and Jayson Oweh, can help improve the defense.On offense, running backs Journey Brown, Ricky Slade, Noah Cain and Devyn Ford are going to be needed to help a unit replacing Miles Sanders and quarterback Trace McSorley.Ford hasn't gotten to campus yet, but the other three will be on display in the spring game.- Tom VanHaaren Rutgers Scarlet Knights 3:30 p.m.ET What we're excited to see: The Scarlet Knights are in need of some reasons for optimism, and the most likely provider there is sophomore quarterback Art Sitkowski.Head coach Chris Ash said Sitkowski has taken some steps forward in the past few weeks after starting 11 games in his first year on campus last fall.- Dan Murphy Pac-12 Arizona Wildcats 8 p.m.ET, Pac-12 Network What we're excited to see: Arizona offensive coordinator Noel Mazzone said this spring that all his quarterbacks would get the same amount of reps. That group, of course, includes Khalil Tate, who went into last season as a Heisman Trophy favorite before a slow start and lack of team success derailed his chances.Can Tate return to the 2017 form that saw him become one of the most dominant players in the country?Saturday's spring game won't completely answer that, but he's definitely the player to keep an eye on.-- Kyle Bonagura Stanford Cardinal 4 p.m.ET, Pac-12 Network What we're excited to see: The Cardinal are in an interesting spot.After a decade of dominating the conference primarily with a physical run-first approach, they were forced to shift gears last season and rely mostly on quarterback K.J.Costello and the passing game.It's hard to imagine that coach David Shaw sees that as a long-term solution, but with Costello back for another year, chances are there will be more of the same for at least another year.Saturday's practice should feature enough scrimmaging to provide some insight into how that process is going.-- Kyle Bonagura Utah Utes 1 p.m ET, Pac-12 Network What we're excited to see: The Utes are one of the few Pac-12 teams that will attempt to simulate a gamelike atmosphere, which will be especially valuable in evaluating some of the younger players who haven't seen much game action yet in their college careers.Beyond that, it's the first real look at coordinator Andy Ludwig's vision for what the Utes will look like offensively since returning to Salt Lake City after 10 years away.-- Kyle Bonagura SEC Alabama Crimson Tide 2:00 p.m.ET, ESPN2 What we're excited to see: There are some interesting things to watch on offense -- most notably the revamped line and running backs -- but it's the defense that should receive the most attention.Coordinator Tosh Lupoi, star defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and half the starters from last season are gone.With new defensive coordinator Pete Golding in charge, there's a lot to do.The good news is that a solid core of Dylan Moses, Xavier McKinney and Raekwon Davis is in place, and pass-rusher Terrell Lewis and cornerback Trevon Diggs return too.But pay attention to how lesser-known quantities such as defensive backs Jared Mayden and Patrick Surtain II develop to tell you just how good this Alabama defense will be.- Alex Scarborough Auburn Tigers 4:00 p.m.ET, SEC Network What we're excited to see: Gus Malzahn's return to playcalling duties is an important development, but it's unlikely he's going to show anything during a televised scrimmage.Rather than X's and O's, look toward the quarterbacks' execution.Replacing Jarrett Stidham won't be easy without much actual experience behind him.Malik Willis, Joey Gatewood and Cord Sandberg have time in the program, but are relatively unknown.Folks around Auburn are high on true freshman legacy Bo Nix, but he'll need to get off to a fast start if he wants to win the job right out of the gates.- Alex Scarborough Florida Gators 1 p.m.ET, SEC Network+ What we're excited to see: Coach Dan Mullen has promised some tricks during the spring game, beyond joking that he might fudge the attendance numbers to read 41,014.That's a dig at Florida State, which Florida beat 41-14.So, if it seems Mullen is loose headed into the spring game, he has reason to be: The Gators have a settled starter in Feleipe Franks and talent across the board at the skill positions.New starters on the offensive and defensive lines will be the keys to watch.- Andrea Adelson Kentucky Wildcats 6 p.m.ET, Friday, SEC Network What we're excited to see: Mark Stoops has steadily built the program, and the Wildcats won 10 games last season for the first time since 1977.But whereas last year's team was laden with experienced players, the 2019 version of the Wildcats will feature several newer faces eager to prove they're ready to continue the momentum.Many of those new faces will be on defense, and a lot of eyes will also be on quarterback Terry Wilson to see how much more efficient and accurate he's become as a passer.- Chris Low Mississippi State Bulldogs 2:00 p.m.ET, ESPNU What we're excited to see: It's tempting to pay close attention to the quarterbacks, where Keytaon Thompson appears to be the heir apparent to Nick Fitzgerald despite coach Joe Moorhead's flirtation with a few grad transfers this offseason.Instead, watch the defense, where there is major work to do without stars Montez Sweat, Jeffery Simmons and Johnathan Abram.Erroll Thompson, Leo Lewis and Willie Gay Jr. form one of the most experienced linebacker groups in the SEC, but they'll need players such as Chauncey Rivers and Kobe Jones to step up and join them as all-conference-caliber players for the defense to play close to as well as it did last season.- Alex Scarborough Missouri Tigers 4:00 p.m.ET, ESPNU What we're excited to see: This is easy.It's Kelly Bryant, and it isn't even close.There's the Clemson angle, of course, which is as much about how he left as it is how well Trevor Lawrence played thereafter.But there's also the matter of the guy Bryant is attempting to replace.Drew Lock was a three-year starter who set an SEC record for touchdowns and is projected by many to be a first-round pick.With big shoes to fill and even bigger questions about his development post-Clemson, Bryant will be under a microscope.-- Alex Scarborough Tennessee Volunteers 6 p.m.ET, SEC Network What we're excited to see: While Tennessee returns many of its key contributors from last season, fans are probably more intrigued to get a glimpse at what this team will look like in Year 2 under Jeremy Pruitt with an overhauled coaching staff.Pruitt brought in Jim Chaney from Georgia as offensive coordinator and former Tennessee national championship quarterback Tee Martin as passing game coordinator and receivers coach.Derrick Ansley comes over from the NFL ranks and will call plays on defense.Can the Vols be more explosive on offense, and will some unproven players be able to come through in the defensive line?-- Chris Low Texas A&M Aggies 8:30 p.m.ET, Friday, Network TBD What we're excited to see: The Aggies have a handful of young, intriguing players to scout.Highly regarded freshman tight end Baylor Cupp, whose measurables head coach Jimbo Fisher raves about, will be worth watching as A&M looks to find a successor to Jace Sternberger.Sophomores Jashaun Corbin (running back) and Leon O'Neal (safety) are among the exciting second-year players likely stepping into starting roles in 2019.-- Sam Khan Jr. American UCF Knights 2:30 p.m.ET What we're excited to see: The focus will no doubt be on the quarterbacks, especially Darriel Mack Jr. and Brandon Wimbush as they compete for the starting job.Mack replaced injured starter McKenzie Milton at the end of last season; Wimbush transferred in from Notre Dame.Beyond saying Mack and Wimbush were getting equal reps, UCF coaches haven't gone into great detail about what they have seen at practice or who might have the edge.So the spring game could reveal some clues about where they stand.- Andrea Adelson FBS Independent Notre Dame Fighting Irish 12:30 p.m.ET, NBC Sports Network What we're excited to see: "We want to be a tempo offense," quarterback Ian Book recently told ESPN.Sophomore receivers Joe Wilkins, Lawrence Keys III, Kevin Austin Jr. and Braden Lenzy should provide Book with top-end speed options.Book has focused more on attacking the deep middle and will look for tight end Cole Kmet and others.The shuffling lineup at linebacker, with players and with positions, is also worth tracking.- Adam Rittenberg

How Ryan Day rocketed from New Hampshire to Ohio State coach:::::Bobby Swigert was scrubbed in and standing beside a tray of orthopedic surgery utensils one day this winter when the conversation veered, as it often does in central Ohio, toward college football.The surgeon was part way through drilling a routine hole in some poor sap's tibia when Swigert, now a medical device salesman, casually mentioned that he played for Ryan Day years earlier at Boston College.The surgeon's head snapped up.The drill stopped spinning."Really?"he asked."What's he like?Is he ready for this?"Swigert laughed.The former wide receiver is one of the many people who know Day well enough to assure Buckeye fans that the new head coach at Ohio State is a hire they will come to appreciate.Day sprung from relative anonymity to landing one of the most coveted jobs in football in just a few short years.After a three-game audition last September, he was officially named as Urban Meyer's replacement at the end of the 2018 season.A few months shy of his 40th birthday, Day was a head coach for the first time.He takes over a program that has won three of the past five Big Ten championships and finished ranked in the top five nationally in four of those years.He is stepping into the shoes of one of modern football's most accomplished winners.He inherits a well-oiled machine with the unenviable task of making it his own without messing it up.His margin of error?Non-existent."You beat the rival," Meyer told him."Every other game you have to win as well.Every player has to get drafted in the first two rounds.No off-the-field issues, and never lose to that rival."Then the old coach wished him luck and flashed the smile of a downhill-bound trekker at a trailhead greeting.Former players such as Swigert, mentors such as Meyer, Chip Kelly and Steve Addazio, and Day's closest friends have all given him the same message Swigert gave the surgeon: He is ready.Winning and leading have defined Day for as long as any of them can remember.Cut him open, it's in his bones.As a quarterback at New Hampshire under offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, Ryan Day was known for his intensity.AP Photo/Newport News Daily Press, Kenneth Silver Day grew up in the bleachers of Manchester, New Hampshire.He and his two younger brothers were part of a group of kids who all had one reason or another for regularly attending the Division II basketball games at New Hampshire College (later renamed Southern New Hampshire University).The little games they concocted to keep themselves entertained always had winners and losers, and Day was almost always the former.Maybe it was watching the Penmen, who won six conference titles starting in the early 1990s and averaged nearly 20 victories a season during the 33-year coaching career of Stan Spirou -- a man who has served as a father figure for Day for the past 30 years.Maybe it was the desire to seem invincible in his brothers' eyes or in the eyes of the coach's daughter -- a year older and a pretty good athlete herself, Day adopted the philosophy early that in basketball, foot races, fights and myriad other competitions there was nothing worse than a loss."It was on a different level from the very beginning," says Jim Statires."It was constant."Statires' father was close friends with Spirou, and so he too ended up in the bleachers frequently.He and Day met Matt Dufour, the son of one of Spirou's assistants, at the games.The three boys were soon inseparable.They spent summer days battling with each other at a local pool.In the evenings, they ate chicken tenders at Puritan Backroom, the restaurant Statires' family ran for generations, until they were old enough to bus tables or scoop ice cream for customers.Winters remained reserved for basketball.Together the boys won regional Catholic Youth Organization championships in grade school and eventually a state championship at Manchester Central High School during their junior year.Day emerged as the star guard as much because of his intelligence and his athleticism.He was the catcher for the high school baseball team and the quarterback for its football team, another group that won a state title for Manchester Central."He was always a leader," Dufour says."He's the person you want taking the last shot.He had the ability to will himself to be good, it seemed.He made everyone feel like they were part of something bigger than ourselves."By the time they were wrapping up high school and preparing to ship off in different directions, Dufour figured his friend would end up as a coach.Day and Dufour were the friends that found each other for heart-to-hearts when busy days and nights were winding to an end.Dufour remembers plenty of those campfire-burning-low conversations in which Day laid out his plans for their future.Ry, Doof and Jimmy would all find homes in some nice neighborhood around Manchester, fill them up with kids and sit in the bleachers together watching their next generation in Little League games and CYO tournaments.The only snag was that Day still had a lot of winning in front of him and no idea where that would lead him.Urban Meyer always had Ryan Day pegged as a potential replacement at Ohio State.Kirk Irwin/Getty Images Brian Mallette watched Day's first media conference as Ohio State's head coach from his office in Naples, Florida, and could swear it was 1999 again.The rosy-cheeked adult staring back at him on the screen was the same 20-year-old kid who tucked his hands into the collar of his shoulder pads and answered questions from the New Hampshire Union-Leader after winning the starting quarterback job for the UNH Wildcats.Mallette, a wide receiver, was living in an off-campus house with Day by the time both were competing for starting jobs as redshirt sophomores in the spring of 1999.Day was struggling with a back injury at the time, and Mallette remembers the brace his buddy had to wear was inhibiting his ability to let it rip.The Wildcats' new offensive coordinator, a fellow Manchester Central graduate named Chip Kelly, stood and watched during practice one day as first-year head coach Sean McDonnell barked at Day for coming up short on one pass after another.Tempers flared.Day missed another receiver.McDonnell connected with another verbal jab.Day had enough.He tore off the back brace in the middle of the practice field and spun a dart to Mallette down the sideline."How's that coach?"Day screamed."Is that good enough for you?"His teammates were sold.Day battled with a senior for the starting job the rest of the spring and into fall camp.When it came time for McDonnell to pick his first starting quarterback in August it was Day's leadership that helped him win the job."He just had a way of getting people to be their best selves," McDonnell said."He's always had a presence, a quiet confidence, with the guys."Day started for the next three seasons.He set passing records as a willing guinea pig in the infancy of an offense that would reshape college football.Day and Kelly sequestered themselves in front of a chalkboard or in the film room for long nights.Day and his roommates kept a dry-erase board near the kitchen door of their off-campus house.Statires and Dufour, who were off to school at Colby-Sawyer and Brown, respectively, were both regular weekend visitors to the house on Young Drive and remember the dry-erase board well.In theory it was to leave messages for each other about missed phone calls or house chores.In practice, they often found Day standing alone in the kitchen scribbling down X's and O's with a tweak to the playbook or some odd new idea.Mallette says he missed a lot of messages.Day's competitive streak, and his willingness to compete in anything, didn't dwindle in college.Mallette remembers a Friday afternoon when the guys were planning to head north for a ski trip along with their girlfriends and a few other friends.Day suggested they stop by the rec center on campus before they picked up their weekend dates to check out a Wiffle Ball tournament in the gym.Once they were there, Day couldn't resist playing a game.Once they got a win under their belts, Day couldn't leave.Some six hours later, their dates were still waiting to head to the ski lodge while Day was diving on hardwood floors to catch fly balls.The ski weekend was getting a late start.There was, after all, an "Intramural Champs" T-Shirt at stake."That didn't go well," Mallette says."We didn't have cell phones at the time so they were just kind of sitting there waiting for us.But we got up there.It was important to get that T-shirt and win that thing."Mallette doesn't recall what became of his date for that weekend.He does remember Day's date was Nina Spirou, the same coach's daughter who grew up with the boys at basketball games in Manchester.She took the delay in stride.They, of course, did win the thing.Mallette and Day found a lot of success together during their time at UNH.No game stands out more, though, than the comeback against No.2 Delaware in November 2000.Day connected with Mallette on a hook-and-ladder play that completed a 28-point second-half comeback.Two decades into his successful career as head coach at New Hampshire, McDonnell still has a picture of that day prominently displayed in his office.Day's first call when he got off the bus back in New Hampshire that night was to Dufour."Dude, you're not going to believe how we pulled this off," Day yelled into the phone.Ryan Day was a graduate assistant, receivers coach, and finally quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator during three different stints at Boston College.Sean Meyers/Icon Sportswire Phone calls became more common than late-night chats for Statires, Dufour and Day as the latter set out on a pinball rise through the ranks of coaching.Day worked as a graduate assistant for a year at New Hampshire and for two at Boston College before Urban Meyer called and offered him a position with the Florida Gators.He decided if he was leaving New England he would at least need to bring some of the best of home with him.So he borrowed some money from a fellow Boston College assistant and asked the old coach's daughter, Nina, if she'd be willing to become a young coach's wife.Statires and Dufour stood next to Day's brothers as their childhood friends exchanged vows.The next day, the groom reported for fall camp in Gainesville.Statires, Dufour and Mallette managed to catch a game at most of the Days' stops as he bounced between Temple and Boston College and then off to the NFL for a few years before landing at Ohio State.When they couldn't make it in person, they kept in touch with calls and texts to relive the big moments and jokingly compare them to their victories back in Manchester.There were calls after he got his first full-time job at Temple.Then a year later, while he was at Boston College, when his buddies learned that Day had hopped a flight to Blacksburg, Virginia, despite a doctor's recommendation not to fly 12 hours after getting his appendix removed.Day coached from the sideline -- being careful not to tear open the fresh stitches from surgery -- while the No.2-ranked Eagles pulled off a late comeback on the road to stay unbeaten.No one in Manchester was surprised to hear that Day decided he couldn't miss the game.Fellow coaches marvel at his ability to stay in touch with his roots while dedicating so much time to his family, his profession and his colleagues.Jay Civetti, who worked with Day at Boston College, recalls calling his old friend to ask if they could talk through an upcoming job interview Civetti had to be the head coach at Tufts.Day said he'd be happy to help and suggested Civetti meet him in the gym of a different small college in Boston.Southern New Hampshire's basketball team was in town, and Day had only a couple of hours to watch his father-in-law's team before getting back to breaking down film.They chatted in the bleachers as Day kept tabs on the basketball game.Civetti got the job."I don't know what it is.He was always like that," Civetti says."He could have 12 things going on at once and be great at all of them.No one ever says that Ryan Day doesn't do anything really, really well."Buckeyes fans will expect Ryan Day to be celebrating wins over Michigan, such as this one last November.Joe Maiorana/USA TODAY Sports The Days moved six times during a seven-year span before Meyer hired him again at Ohio State.Each time, they were eager to invite their old friends to a new home at the start of a new football season.Day had, along the way, developed a reputation as an innovative, player-friendly coach who was remarkably quick on his feet in pressure situations.He would help provide a rudder for an Ohio State offense that had lost some direction in the year before he arrived.As surprising as it may have been for outsiders when Day was named as the interim replacement during Meyer's suspension last August, those around Ohio State's program could see it coming.Meyer pegged Day as a potential heir to the Big Ten empire he had resurrected in his seven years in Columbus.The test drive last fall came earlier than anyone expected, but now Day inherits a job that would be the envy of any first-time coach.He has a well-stocked roster, a cadre or experienced assistants and a program that has as much institutional and fan support as any in the country.His biggest challenge in replacing the man who built much of that will likely be drawing the line between following the formula left behind by Meyer without trying to be Meyer.On the eve of his first weekend as a head coach last August, at the tail end of perhaps the most chaotic month of his coaching career, Day took a short break from his new duties to stop at a restaurant not far from campus.In the back of the restaurant he found a table full of familiar faces.The old crew from Manchester had been to plenty of games together, and they weren't going to miss Day's first as the leader of the Buckeyes."As we're leaving the restaurant with them, literally everybody wanted to shake his hand, pat him on the back," Statires says."And it was like, 'Wow this is different than it was last year.'"Day, however, was the same.The coaches, players and friends that know Ryan Day best say there's no chance he'll get lost in the big shoes he now must fill."He's very comfortable in who he is," Statires says."I don't think that's going to be an issue.He believes in who he is."Ohio Stadium may have enough seats to squeeze the entire population of Manchester inside its large walls, but if Day does ever end up in danger of losing himself in that grandeur, his closest friends will still be hanging together in the bleachers to remind him who he is.
WNBA draft grades -- Phoenix and Minnesota score A-plus marks:::::WNBA draft day is one of hope and promise, but things get real pretty quickly.Remember the math: 12 teams with 12 roster spots.It's a challenge to get and keep a job in the WNBA.Your work is cut out for you, kids.Still, some franchises need an infusion of youth, with four-time champion Minnesota and three-time champ Phoenix on that list.In a draft that didn't have a guaranteed future superstar but featured a number of players with potential to contribute, the Lynx and the Mercury particularly stand out after filling needs with their choices.Let's take a team-by-team look, in order of their grades: Draftees: No.8 Alanna Smith, Stanford, 6-4 forward; No.11 Brianna Turner, Notre Dame, 6-3 forward; No.13 Sophie Cunningham, Missouri, 6-1 guard; No.32 Arica Carter, Louisville, 5-8 guard Evaluation: The Mercury would love nothing more than to get one more championship for Diana Taurasi, but she'll need to help groom some youngsters for that to happen.These four players all have the right personality to learn from her.Smith has size and outside shooting skills and is bursting with more potential to develop.The Mercury traded Marie Gulich, a first-round pick last year, for Turner, and the Notre Dame post fits the Mercury better.She's a terrific defender who has come back well from the ACL injury that caused her to sit a year in college.Cunningham is known for her grit and hustle, and she could have no better mentor than Taurasi.Carter was a good defender and cog for the Cardinals, and could find a similar role in the pro game.Grade: A-plus Draftees: No.6 Napheesa Collier, UConn, 6-2 forward; No.16 Jessica Shepard, Notre Dame, 6-4 forward; No.20 Cierra Dillard, Buffalo, 5-9 guard; No.30 Kenisha Bell, Minnesota, 5-9 guard Evaluation: Lindsay Whalen has retired, Maya Moore is sitting out this season and the other members of the Lynx's championship core -- Seimone Augustus, Rebekkah Brunson and Sylvia Fowles -- are all north of 30.The Lynx know they have to get younger.Collier is a high-energy post player who will expand her game.Shepard can do a lot as a post, too.Rivals at UConn and Notre Dame the past two seasons, Collier and Shepard now could be the post duo of the future for Minnesota.Without Moore, the Lynx need scoring, and guards Dillard and Bell, if they make the squad, can help provide that.And the Lynx also used one of their draft picks, No.18 Natisha Hiedeman, to trade to Connecticut for Lexie Brown, a second-year guard who could blossom with the Lynx.Grade: A-plus Draftees: No.5 Arike Ogunbowale, Notre Dame, 5-8 guard; No.17 Megan Gustafson, Iowa, 6-3 center; No.22 Kennedy Burke, UCLA, 6-1 guard; No.29 Morgan Bertsch, UC Davis, 6-4 forward Evaluation: With point guard Skylar Diggins-Smith, who is pregnant, out some and perhaps all of this season, and center Liz Cambage still wanting a trade, new coach Brian Agler has to reshape this team.He has some good pieces to do that.Ogunbowale is a premier scorer who could see a lot of playing time, especially with Diggins-Smith out.Gustafson fell into the second round because she was so pinned to the low block as a college player at 6-3; let's see how she develops her game as a pro.She doesn't lack work ethic, for sure.Burke could make a big impact defensively, which Agler would like a lot.Bertsch was a strong scorer in college, although it seems unlikely both she and Gustafson would make the roster.Grade: A Draftees: No.1 Jackie Young, Notre Dame, 6-0 guard Evaluation: The Aces had one pick, and it was the first, so they could do whatever they wanted.Had Sabrina Ionescu entered the draft, she likely would have been the choice.But without her, the multidimensional Young was the clear pick.Young was a high school scoring sensation, but with the Irish she did everything: score, pass, rebound, defend.She was their best all-around player, but played well with other stars at Notre Dame.She will do the same at the pro level, because she can easily fit in, while also having the ability to take over.Grade: A Draftees: No.2 Asia Durr, Louisville, 5-10 guard; No.14 Han Xu, China, 6-9 center; No.26 Megan Huff, Utah, 6-3 forward Evaluation: The Liberty have new ownership and would like to recapture some of the old spirit they used to have with their fan base.Franchise centerpiece Tina Charles needs more help from a consistent big scoring threat, and that should be Durr's biggest strength.She's an extremely hard worker, and nobody knows more about successful guard play than Liberty coach Katie Smith, a Hall of Famer.Han is just 19 and we can't be entirely sure of her availability because of Chinese national team commitments.But it could be fantastic for the Liberty and the league if she becomes China's first WNBA star, especially in New York City.Huff also could provide post depth for New York.Grade: B-plus Draftees: No.9 Kristine Anigwe, Cal, 6-4 forward/center; No.18 Natisha Hiedeman, Marquette, 5-8 guard; No.21 Bridget Carleton, Iowa State, 6-1 guard; No.33 Regan Magarity, Virginia Tech, 6-3 forward Evaluation: The Sun don't have a lot of needs this season from this draft, but they're also looking to the future.Anigwe dropped further in the first round than many expected, which means there are questions about her WNBA adjustment despite huge stats.Then again, she might make people regret passing on her.Hiedeman was drafted by Minnesota but then traded to the Sun for Lexie Brown; she can play both guard spots.Carleton was Big 12 player of the year and had a great career with Iowa State, although this is a tough roster to crack even with her skill set.Same applies to Magarity.Grade: B-plus Draftees: No.4 Katie Lou Samuelson, UConn, 6-3 guard; No.15 Chloe Jackson, Baylor, 5-8 guard; No.27 Maria Conde, Spain, 6-1 forward Evaluation: Samuelson as a lottery pick was a bit of a surprise.By the same token, there's no question she can score and gives Chicago another 3-point threat.And drafting UConn players high is always a good bet.Jackson upped her draft stock more than anyone with her NCAA tournament run to the championship.As a converted point guard from shooting guard, she has a chance to learn from one of the best true point guards to ever play in the WNBA in Courtney Vandersloot.Conde played collegiately at Florida State and could provide post depth if she makes the squad.Grade: B Draftees: No.3 Teaira McCowan, Mississippi State, 6-7 center; No.25 Paris Kea, North Carolina, 5-9 guard; No.28 Caliya Robinson, Georgia, 6-3 forward Evaluation: The rebuilding continues for the Fever, who unfortunately lost one of their 2018 first-round picks, Victoria Vivians, for 2019 after she tore her ACL playing overseas.They have another Mississippi State product in McCowan, a rim protector and rebounder who might expand her game a little offensively.The Fever are still looking for an identity in the post-Tamika Catchings era, and maybe McCowan can help them find it.Kea is a talented scoring guard who might help with Vivians out.Robinson has a WNBA-style build, but her game didn't evolve much while at Georgia.If she makes the Fever roster, maybe we'll see more of that.Grade: B Draftees: No.12 Ezi Magbegor, Australia, 6-4 forward; No.24 Anriel Howard, Mississippi State, 5-11 forward; No.36 Macy Miller, South Dakota State, 6-0 guard Evaluation: The defending WNBA champions benefited greatly from the draft and some trades in recent years, and put it all together with ageless veteran point guard Sue Bird last year.The Storm are a threat to repeat this year.They didn't need a lot from the draft, but they got some pieces that could help.The Australian Magbegor is a tantalizing talent, but still young and a bit raw.The Storm have the talent to give her time to develop.Howard is fantastic athlete, but as a "tweener" sizewise, she'll face some challenges establishing herself.Miller is jack-of-all-trades big guard, but cracking this roster will be hard.Grade: B Draftees: No.7 Kalani Brown, Baylor, 6-7 center; No.19 Marina Mabrey, Notre Dame, 5-11 guard; No.31 Angela Salvadores, Spain, 5-10 guard Evaluation: Brown upped her stock with her NCAA tournament success, and she can provide some welcome size for the Sparks in matching up with other big women.Of course, there's always still the possibility that Dallas center Liz Cambage gets the trade to Los Angeles that she wants, and Brown goes elsewhere.But if not, Brown can help the Sparks.Mabrey is Notre Dame's all-time leading 3-point shooter, and the Sparks were eighth in the WNBA in treys made last season.Salvadores spent one season at Duke, and has played professionally in Spain, and could provide guard depth.Grade: B Draftees: No.10 Kiara Leslie, NC State, 6-0 guard; No.34 Sam Fuehring, Louisville, 6-3 forward Evaluation: The joke is that coach and general manager Mike Thibault lives to mess up mock drafts, because he tends to take players at unexpected spots.Reality is, he's a career-long talent scout who couldn't care less what the mocks say.Leslie had a lot on her shoulders as the injuries kept piling up at NC State, and she handled that well.Just as Thibault saw more in guard Ariel Atkins of Texas last year, picking her at No.7, he sees a lot in Leslie.As for Fuehring, she has the toughness that will at least get her a look in the WNBA.The Mystics made the WNBA Finals for the first time last year, even with Elena Delle Donne dealing with a knee injury suffered in the semis.They should be a strong team this season without much help from their draft picks, so anything they get is a bonus.Grade: B-minus Draftees: No.23 Maite Cazorla, Oregon, 5-10 guard; No.35 Li Yueru, China, 6-7 center Evaluation: The Dream made a run at the WNBA Finals last season even with star Angel McCoughtry out with an ACL injury.Center was a position of need, and they drafted one in Notre Dame's Brianna Turner, but promptly traded her to Phoenix for Marie Gulich, who was taken No.12 by the Mercury last season and got little court time.The Dream took post player Li in the third round, but passed on her more highly touted Chinese teammate Han Xu, a 6-9 center they could have taken instead of Turner at No.11.The Dream are either concerned about Han's availability this season, or they really believe in Gulich.Cazorla did a nice job playing alongside the sensational Sabrina Ionescu at Oregon, and as a true point guard, might find a spot with the Dream.Grade: C-minus
For Christina Hammer, fighting in ballyhooed bout was her destiny:::::Generally, middleweight champion Christina Hammer is as amiable and friendly as any fighter you'll come across.But when you ask her what she would be doing if she weren't a professional prizefighter, her tone switches drastically."That's a crazy question," she answered incredulously."I mean, boxing is my passion."Editor's Picks Claressa Shields fighting to be undisputed champion inside and outside the ring Claressa Shields has the opportunity to become the undisputed middleweight champion on Saturday.She's also fighting for more important social issues like eliminating gender labels and equality in women's boxing.While many fighters will tell you that they didn't so much choose boxing, but that the sport chose them, no such rhetoric will be heard from the 28-year-old Hammer (24-0, 11 KOs), who faces Claressa Shields on Saturday in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in a fight to unify the middleweight championship.Hammer willingly chose boxing as she grew up in Germany, after her parents migrated from Kazakhstan to pursue better opportunities for their family.Hammer, by all accounts, grew up in a happy, stable environment, unlike many others in the sport."My family was very sporty and we watched [boxing] all the time at home," recalled Hammer, who was just 1 year old when the family left Kazakhstan."My uncles trained boxing and my father stayed home on the weekends and we trained together.He taught us to move, to punch, to do push-ups, run and stuff like that."My uncles trained in the boxing gym, and I followed them."Christina Hammer played several sports at a young age, but chose to advance herself in boxing."I got to be like a real athlete," she said.Michael Owens/Getty Images Boxing quickly became more than just a weekend activity for Hammer.It became her passion.While she participated in other sports, it was boxing that captivated her."Because it was always a competition and I loved this feeling, that I wanted to show who's the best, work hard and compete with boys.That was so interesting to me," Hammer said."I got to be like a real athlete."By the age of 18, after a short amateur career consisting of 23 fights, Hammer made boxing her profession and moved away from home, training under the guidance of Dmitri Kirnos.While staking her lot in the hurt business, she would eventually continue her higher education at the Campus Unna University of Health and Science.Hammer has had a storied career so far.Since making her pro debut in 2009, she has captured multiple world titles at junior middleweight and middleweight.Currently she is the reigning WBC and WBO middleweight champion, with the remaining two belts (WBA and IBF) held by Shields.With all four belts on the line, this matchup is being billed as the biggest bout in female boxing history.It's one of the rare fights featuring women that will be showcased on premium cable in the United States."Of course it's the biggest fight, because I'm a longtime champion and she's a two-time gold medalist, and these fights in the past never happened and people want to see this fight, champion versus champion," Hammer said."And that's a game-changer for women's boxing, that we have this opportunity to fight prime time Saturday night on Showtime.It's huge for women's boxing."While the likes of undisputed welterweight champion Cecilia Braekhus and unified lightweight world champion Katie Taylor play to large throngs in their home regions and are generally well accepted, American audiences have not been all that receptive to female boxing.Christina Hammer called her champion-versus-champion match with Claressa Shields, which is being featured on premium cable on Saturday night, "a game-changer for women's boxing."Michael Owens/Getty Images In the past, while Christy Martin, Mia St. John, Laila Ali and Ann Wolfe had various degrees of popularity and respect, they were more or less shunned by the mainstream.At best, they were curiosities; at worst, novelty acts.And there simply weren't enough compelling matchups that moved the needle with the public.Back in December, when HBO bid farewell to boxing, the cable channel broadcast one final card that featured Braekhus and Shields on the same bill.It was attended by less than a thousand fans.But maybe that isn't a fair gauge on the popularity of female boxing, given that the event was basically a funeral for the network's boxing coverage.In Hammer versus Shields, you have a fight of great importance and two accomplished boxers in their physical primes.But with that comes a certain amount of pressure for them to put forth a memorable battle."It's always pressure when you fight, it's normal," Hammer said."The people want to see a great fight.I prepare for everything, because in boxing anything can happen, and I want to win and I have to work hard.I've pushed myself so hard because I know Claressa is a hard opponent."It's clear that what's on the line is not just the undisputed middleweight title but also the designation as queen of boxing, the face of the sport.When asked her thoughts about Shields, Hammer responds with a laugh.Christina Hammer has done some modeling, but don't be fooled.She's completely dedicated to the sweet science."It's like inside the ring I can be a beast, and outside, like a beauty."Mike Pont/WireImage "I don't know, I don't have a relationship with her," Hammer said."I think she hates me, but I just want to do my job and be undisputed champion.I think we are very different, and maybe she's a little jealous of me."Like, I'm doing these modeling things, and at the press conference she told me, 'Why are you doing bikini pictures?'and I told her, 'Because they are paying me for that.Maybe they don't want to see you in a bikini.'"I think it's very good that I'm not the typical type of boxer.It's like inside the ring I can be a beast, and outside, like a beauty."Some will roll their eyes at Hammer's comments (no matter how honest they are), and others will question her authenticity.But it's difficult to doubt her commitment to the sport.At 28, she is wed only to the sport of boxing ("no kids, not married," Hammer points out), and she makes it clear, "My life is about boxing."Other aspects of her life can wait.For now boxing is her main focus."I think two or three more years, because I first want to finish this job, be undisputed champion," Hammer said."I think after this fight there will be a lot of opportunities, a lot of doors that can be open with this fight.It's huge that this fight happen."
Emotion, respect and class How Crusaders navigated Christchurch return:::::ESPN was on the ground as the Crusaders played their first game at home after the terror attacks in Christchurch.(2:00) The Avon River winds its way through the heart of Christchurch.In the centre of town, where old meets new, the Bridge of Remembrance connects one side of the Avon to the other.A stone arch etched with the World War I campaigns of Mesopotamia, France and Belgium on one side, and Palestine, Egypt and Gallipoli on the other, stands proudly as a reminder to the nation's involvement in the first great global conflict.Standing on its eastern side, looking back to the west, and poking its head above the buildings in the distance, is one of many cranes that continue to rebuild the city after the 2011 earthquake.At that moment, while thinking of hundreds of thousands killed on the battlefields of Europe and North Africa, the fact that 185 lives were lost in that earthquake also hits home.And that's before you've reached the city's Cathedral, which continues to sit in ruins, just a couple of hundred metres away.It's then you realise just how far Christchurch still has to go in its rebuild from that tragedy, let alone the one that occurred just last month.Editor's Picks Would Beauden Barrett departure be an All Blacks tipping point?As more and more All Blacks join the post-Rugby World Cup exodus, Craig Dowd analyses what it would mean should Beauden Barrett follow suit.He has a message for players who have decided to head north, too.Almost a month on, that act of terrorism remains extremely raw.But somehow amid the darkness, people are beginning the process of getting on with life.The memory of those 50 lives lost will never be far from mind, but still, life must go on.That process continued last Saturday, when around 11,000 people made their way to Christchurch Stadium for the return of the region's beloved Super Rugby franchise, the Crusaders, and their Round 8 clash with the Brumbies.They began to roll up an hour-and-a-half out from the 5:15 p.m. [NZT] kickoff, a steadily increasing tide of red and black foot traffic eager to see the return of their two-time defending champion.Greeted with an increase in security screening, there was an immediate reminder that their city had changed forever, not that one was needed.Many were happy to stop and chat: to talk about their favourite Crusaders; what the team meant to the region; how they could help it recover from another senseless tragedy; and, of course, how many points they would pile on the Brumbies.Crusaders players share in the moment of silence to honour the Christchurch terror attack victims ahead of their clash with the Brumbies, April 6, 2019 Kai Schwoerer/Getty Images There were those too who spoke with passion, even a tiny tear in the corner of the eye, on the name debate that has engulfed not just the franchise supporters themselves, but seemingly every rugby fan up and down New Zealand.That name debate stems from the link to the medieval Crusades, when Muslims were the direct target of violence and murder, the same situation that occurred in Christchurch last month.For every person who says the Crusaders name has to go, there is one adamant it must stay.As it stands, New Zealand Rugby and the Crusaders have engaged Research First to conduct a complete review of the situation with an eye toward making any changes ahead of the 2020 season.Some have, however, already occurred, such as the removal of prematch entertainment that saw sword-wielding knights circle the field on horseback.Last Saturday, they were instead replaced with a minute's silence prematch and a version of Kiwi Dave Dobbyn's "Welcome Home."But soon, referee Jaco Peyper blew his whistle and the game got underway.Crusaders fans pause to remember the victims of the Christchurch terror attack.Kai Schwoerer/Getty Images For much of the first half, the play resembled the gloomy conditions overhead.Patches of enterprising ball movement were ended by one average pass or a poor kick.But the visitors eventually got the break they were after when Owen Franks was sin-binned for a shoulder charge, with the Brumbies heading to the break up 7-0 following a try to skipper Christian Lealiifano.At halftime, while local choir group the Vocal Collective sang two beautiful numbers, the sun began to shine.So too did the Crusaders' play thereafter.From 7-0 down, the hosts flicked an attacking switch that produced 33 points in as many minutes.Doubles to wingers Will Jordan and Sevu Reece, and a swan-dive special from Jordan Taufua, were enough to wrap up the bonus-point 36-14 victory and, for a few hours anyway, put a smile on the faces of those who had attended.With each try, hundreds of red and black flags fluttered proudly around the stadium; the posts also did their thing in lighting up a shade of neon red, the same way zing bails do in T20 cricket.For that second 40 minutes, it was hard to think how the Crusaders wouldn't add another year to the title list that is etched on a light tower in the stadium's southeastern corner.Jordan and coach Scott Robertson later spoke of the pride with which the Crusaders players took in at last being back at home in front of their people.Crusader people."Cantab" people.Jordan Taufua prepares to launch into a swan dive in scoring his second-half try against the Brumbies.Kai Schwoerer/Getty Images When those "Cantab" people talk about their favourite Crusaders of all time, they don't just mention the likes of greats Richie McCaw and Dan Carter, but also guys like Taufua, who received the biggest roar of the day when he came on as a replacement, and Wyatt Crockett, who played more than 200 games for the franchise.Though they loved the brilliance of Carter and now his heir apparent Richie Mo'unga, the breakdown tyro that was McCaw and his All Blacks successor Kieran Read, Crusaders supporters adore Taufua, Crockett and countless others because they play their heart out, or did so, week after week, with little to no fanfare.In a way, these are the guys who best represent what it means to be a Crusader.The terrorist attack of last month has forced people to question that, too.What exactly is in a name?A name that can clearly be drawn to the crusades from medieval times and the slaying of people from the Islamic faith -- the same people who were targeted in Christchurch last month -- but one that also is so fondly followed by the people of the region and the fact it already had helped them back from the edge of despair once before.Just where that decision lands will play out over the coming months, but as New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says, it's one that must be left to the Crusaders organisation and the people from across the franchise's region.Only they can come to a decision about which is the best way to move forward.But no matter which way that decision falls, this mighty sporting team showed, last Saturday, how they can remain a constant.Just like the Avon River itself, the heart continues to flow through Christchurch.This all-conquering, entertaining and resolute rugby team is there to help provide its beat.
'Tougher than I realized':::::TEMPE, Ariz. -- Des Linden returns to her roots each winter, but those roots are hidden below ground as she wraps up a March morning workout at the Arizona State University track.Maroon and gold banners honoring NCAA achievements by other Sun Devil athletes ring the oval.The name of the defending Boston Marathon champion is not among them.When that absence is noted, Linden answers with her typical dry self-deprecation."I didn't do s--- here,'' she says."You don't get a banner if you don't do something.''Everything changed for Linden last April 16, when she slogged through frigid headwinds and sideways rain to win one of the world's most prestigious races -- a beautiful feat of perseverance in the most beastly conditions imaginable.It was also a singular rebuttal to her longtime label: always a factor, seldom a favorite.Linden was, in fact, an All-American in cross-country and track at ASU, but wasn't widely heralded when she turned pro.After a stirring second-place finish at Boston 2011, she logged a series of top-10 finishes at majors, earning respect as a consistent, gutsy runner, but often discounted as a threat to the chokehold East African runners held on the marathon.She chafed at being pigeonholed, and even in the rewarding year that has followed her 2018 triumph, the defiance at her core remains unaltered.Linden's identity is so intertwined with being underestimated that she keeps the notion in her tool box like a sharpening stone."I think people will just put me exactly where I was before and chalk [2018] up to the weather,'' she says over lunch at an outdoor patio near campus."I think that would be short-sighted.If I were looking at a field or a race result, I'd say, 'Wow, she really knows Boston well; she's always been solid on this course.'But I still think people will just chalk it up to a fluke, which is fine."The medal's real.It's in my house.The trophy's there.That's in the books.Moving forward, I think it's the thing that keeps me hungry.Once you've accomplished the thing you've been dreaming of your entire life, what's gonna get you out the door to try again?Yeah, I want to win Boston again, just to see if I can."This lead-up period to Linden's seventh appearance at Boston has been quiet and smooth.A big chunk of it was spent in Arizona sunshine, with periodic jaunts back to her home in northern Michigan and business trips to the East Coast.She pronounced herself happy with her fifth-place finish (1:11:22) in the New York City Half Marathon tuneup last month.It's a marked contrast from the turbulence a year ago at this time, when Linden, 35, was emerging from a prolonged malaise in form and attitude.In late 2017, she was on the verge of "throwing my shoes away,'' or at the very least giving up on major marathons, and she skipped doing one that fall.After a long stretch of formative years with the Hansons-Brooks team, during which Linden bloomed from unknown into a perennial top-10 marathoner, tensions surfaced on the eve of Boston 2018, when, in response to a direct question, she matter-of-factly expressed discomfort with the group's recent addition of Dathan Ritzenhein from the controversial Nike Oregon Project.The backstory made for muted expectations and a giant question mark as Linden stood at the Boston start line.That punctuation morphed into an exclamation point as she found her legs while helping fellow American runners Shalane Flanagan and Molly Huddle, and kept churning through the miles even as other elite runners dropped out, some hypothermic, some mentally vanquished.The disbelief on Linden's face when she leaned into the tape and then fell into the arms of her husband, Ryan, and agent, Josh Cox, was real.Winning the Boston Marathon showed Des Linden how tough she is during the most trying times.AP Photo/Elise Amendola Tooling around Tempe the first week of March in a rented black Camaro, Linden is still close to the elation of that moment, yet never too distant from the frustrations that preceded it and the invisible asterisk attached to it: The first American woman to win Boston in 33 years did so with the slowest time in 40 years."I feel like if I couldn't run another step, if I knew my running career was done tomorrow, I would feel very fulfilled by it,'' she says."It's everything I hoped it would be.But because I'm still competing, I think I put this on myself: 'I'll show you!'even though there's no physical person to show.Just want to prove yourself, to yourself.''Two months after the win, Linden made an official exit from the Hansons' suburban Detroit group (she retains Brooks as a shoe sponsor) and subsequently began working with her former ASU coach, Walt Drenth.It was an easy transition.Both have second homes in northern Michigan.She and Drenth, who left Tempe before Linden's senior year at ASU to take the job he still holds at Michigan State, never lost touch.When she was at her lowest, he encouraged her to break down the road ahead of her to its most basic parts."We get too far ahead of ourselves and we start going down the wormhole of, 'I'm never gonna get out of this.I'm never gonna achieve my goals,''' she says."You can turn in a negative direction really quickly.Not, 'How am I ever gonna win a marathon?'That's way too large.Bring it all the way back to, 'Why did you get into running?What do you love about it?Do you still love it?'and make it sustainable.''The past year has brought Linden a smorgasbord of commercial opportunities and other perks, from throwing out a ceremonial first pitch for her hometown San Diego Padres, to being a presenter at the Billboard Music Awards, to VIP access at a Formula One race in Austin, her biggest passion as a fan.But time has not resolved exactly what's next for her or whether she'll continue to compete and try to make the 2020 Olympic team, which would be her third.Her calendar, she says, is blank after next week."Last year, I learned how much Boston means to me, how important it is that I do my absolute best, and that I'm pretty [expletive] tough, if I can say that,'' Linden says."Tougher than I realized.That's valuable moving forward, if you're feeling sorry for yourself.Or if you're not having a great day, actually there's probably more.Get out of your own way.You've done something really great here before, try to tap into that again.''Monday's current forecast looks sketchy.Linden will run with ambition, but also with the luxury of knowing that the sky could fall in and she'd still be all right.
Sisters set to run Boston Marathon 20 years after surviving 1999 Columbine shooting:::::It was a regular school day.Laura Green, a 14-year-old freshman, threw on a powder-blue tank top, a matching cardigan, a khaki skirt and a pair of Doc Martens.She had two weeks left in the school year at Columbine High.After months of cold days, the sun was finally out.Her town, Littleton, Colorado, looked bright and majestic.As she sat down in the passenger seat of the car her older sister, Sarah Green, 16, was driving on April 20, 1999, Laura thought to herself, "It's going to be a good day."Three hours after they left their house.That's all it took for their lives to change forever when one of the school's janitors yelled, "Run, somebody is shooting."Laura dropped her pizza and sprinted up the stairs from the cafeteria.She stood shoulder to shoulder with 40 other kids in the choir office.She fixed her eyes on the ceiling, hoping the space above them might help her breathe through the intense claustrophobia.They had barricaded the door with two desks and a cabinet.During the same time, Sarah was taking a math test.She dropped her pen in fear when baseball coach Robin Ortiz slammed the door open and told them to "get the hell out; somebody is shooting."She ran out the main entrance and stopped only when she found some classmates in the field across from the school.She watched as the SWAT team members arrived 47 minutes later and positioned themselves behind their vehicle just as bullets began to fly toward them.Chaos ensued, and it wasn't until four hours later that the SWAT team kicked down the door of the choir office and ordered the kids to place their hands on their heads and walk out in a single file.They were taken out through the back entrance, the glass windows shot in, the doors unhinged.With her hands on her head, Laura had to step over the dead body of a classmate she had grown up with since second grade.She was hyperventilating, and tears poured down her face.That was 20 years ago.The 1999 Columbine High School shooting, in which 12 students and one teacher were killed, changed the Green sisters' lives forever, robbing them of a normal high school experience, of being able to sleep in their own rooms at night, of feeling safe at school.But through the uncertainty of it all, they found one thing -- one common thing -- that saved them.Running.Running gave them a sense of purpose and focus -- it gave them a chance to slowly heal.On Monday, Laura and Sarah will tackle their ultimate goal and compete in the Boston Marathon.Sarah, front right, and Laura did not have a normal high school experience.It was often a struggle just to walk through the halls of their school.Courtesy of Laura Green Hall Laura Hall and Sarah Bush, now 34 and 36, live a mile from each other, in Eagle Mountain, Utah, a rolling, rugged town ideal for mountain and trail running.But their paths into the running world were quite different.Laura had run cross country during high school but didn't take it seriously.Matter of fact, she hated it.But in retrospect, she concedes her aversion to running was largely because she wasn't ready to let anything help her heal after that tragic day in 1999.Sarah also ran cross country in high school and fell in love with the mountains and greenery surrounding her.She remembers the feeling of unclenching and the weight lifting from her heart during a good run.She hasn't stopped since."If nothing else goes right in my day, and if I have gone for a run, and I have tackled that, that means that I can tackle that day," Sarah said."Running has the same effect for me as a lot of the medication people are on for depression.I have realized the relief you get from running is the same as the relief you get from a medication."Slowly, Laura began to understand how running made her sister feel, and getting out there, one foot in front of another, became a tonic of sorts, a way to escape from the demons that had been with her since the shooting.She eventually signed up for her first marathon.Then another.Running gave them a chance to finally recover.For Laura, it gave her a chance to free her mind and release the emotions she had harbored for too long.She would eventually compete in a couple of marathons, in Utah and Las Vegas, and two years ago, Laura, now a mother of four, said she aspired to run the Boston Marathon because that was the pinnacle.Last year, she qualified for Boston at the Ogden Marathon.Sarah, who has five children, had already run the 2018 Boston Marathon and, despite the freezing temperatures, loved it.She wanted to run it again, but with her sister by her side.Sarah had held Laura on nights when the horrific images of the mass shooting were too much for her mind to handle.Laura had slept in Sarah's bed when she couldn't fall asleep alone.They were already incredibly close, but running helped them release their emotions.They were each other's therapists, up and running often by 5 a.m. Running offered the sisters moments of levity, even if only for a couple of minutes every day.One of them would say something funny, the other would start giggling, and they'd slow down, hands on their knees, howling with laughter.The sisters have been each other's rocks through every one of those years since Columbine, like the time seven years after the shooting when Laura was on a church mission trip but had to cut it short because of her PTSD-induced attacks.This was nothing new.The trauma of that day often felt as if it would not relent.Sarah struggled sending her kids to school.Several times during the year, she would request access to her son's classroom so she could check whether the exit doors and the safety measures were in place.During the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012, Sarah pulled up outside her son's school, half a country away, and instead of waiting for him like she usually did, she ran across the field and pulled him into a bear hug as he walked out of the school.She went for a run later that day to help channel some positive energy."He was home and he was safe," she thought to herself.Training together for Boston has been special for Sarah and Laura.They ran the Orcas Island 32-miler together in February, finishing hand-in-hand.When Laura needed a water break, Sarah waited for her, and when Sarah needed to catch a breath, Laura held her hand as they slowed down.They found an emotional release, a sense of accomplishment, especially after a long race."I love doing a marathon because it's hard and it proves to me that I can conquer hard things and we as people can conquer hard things," Laura said."There is no person that can tell me that running a marathon is easy."Laura Hall, a mother of four, will compete in her first Boston Marathon on Monday.Courtesy of Laura Green Hall Laura and Sarah can now say "I am from Littleton" after, for a long time, referencing "Denver" to avoid further questions about Columbine.After the shooting, and for many years after, they didn't talk about what happened that day.Laura had spent two years in high school wondering how other kids could laugh and joke with each other.They didn't understand others might be suffering, too, but dealing with it differently.Two years ago, Laura and Sarah decided to share their experiences with children, faculty and administrators in Utah with the aim to destigmatize mental illness, depression and therapy.It took 18 years for them to finally get to a point in which they could talk about their experience without enduring nightmares or anxiety attacks.They spoke about the importance of sharing their thoughts and stressed that whatever they're going through, they're not alone."I feel a deep obligation as a survivor to share my experience," Laura said."Because as we know in this country and this world, these kinds of horrible things happen all the time, and if people who have experienced something similar can look to somebody who is still alive and who has lived 20 years past something horrible and see that I am happy, grab on to a little bit of hope from me, I am happy I experienced it."I am at a point in my life where I am actually grateful for that experience because I want to be able to give people hope."Finishing the Boston Marathon together a few days before the 20th anniversary of the April 20, 1999, shooting would be their way of showing the world that it's possible for survivors to move forward and find a sense of serenity after a life-altering event.Not to mention tackling one of the toughest and most prestigious marathons in the world."When we see the famous Citgo sign, we know we will only have 1 mile left," said Laura, referring to the iconic image near the end of the Boston Marathon."And I asked Sarah, 'How am I supposed to keep it together?'She said, 'You won't, you just have to allow yourself to cry.'"
MLS W2W4: Zlatan's Galaxy look to stay hot; Minnesota opens sparkling Allianz Field:::::Minnesota United christens its brand-new stadium against NYCFC (live at 5 p.m.ET on ESPN2), Zlatan and the Galaxy look to stay hot against the Union, and Seattle and Toronto meet in a rematch of the 2016 and 2017 MLS Cup finals.It's MLS W2W4.House Hunters Minnesota If you haven't watched "House Hunters," then surely someone close to you has.It can be maddening to see the show's couples bicker over something as inane as a light fixture in a guest bathroom, but at the end of the day, everyone is happy with the house that has been selected.Heck, sometimes the real estate agent even gets an invite to the "Three Months Later" cocktail party.Minnesota United have had no such qualms with their new home, the glittering Allianz Field, which will open on Saturday afternoon (live at 5 p.m.ET on ESPN2).With stadiums going up left and right in MLS, Minnesota United's new stomping ground looks pretty sleek and, more importantly, it should provide a home-field advantage for the local team.Unlike the defensively challenged Minnesota United teams of the past two years, this is a side that has clamped down in the back, allowing just eight goals.Winning three of five road games to open the season is no small feat, and that has been helped in part by Darwin Quintero, arguably the league's most underrated star and scorer of three goals.The Colombian excels in anonymity, but Saturday will provide him a national platform to show the rest of the country that Minnesota could have something special brewing in 2019.The Zlatan you love to hate The mind-numbing statistics for Zlatan Ibrahimovic continue to pile up.After last week's one-goal, one-assist performance in Vancouver, the former Manchester United man now has four goals in just three games this season.That makes 26 goals and 11 assists in 30 games since his arrival to MLS a little more than a year ago.Simply incredible.But don't expect Vancouver's Felipe Martins to be lining up to congratulate Ibrahimovic.The Whitecaps midfielder was none too pleased that his counterpart was getting cheered in Vancouver's BC Place.But the reality is that wherever Ibrahimovic goes in this league, he will have his fans.And judging by some of the sparse crowds thus far in 2019, it certainly wouldn't hurt to liven up some of these stadiums.Next up for everyone's favorite Swedish striker is a home date with the Philadelphia Union on Saturday night (10:30 p.m.ET, ESPN+).Unlike Whitecaps defender Doneil Henry, who dared state that Vancouver could keep Ibrahimovic under wraps, which it didn't, Union boss Jim Curtin has smartly decided to err on the side of caution and plans to keep his mouth shut in order to not anger Ibrahimovic.That's sound practice, but it's no guarantee to keep him from scoring.Just like old times in Seattle It will feel like the days of yore when the Seattle Sounders take on Toronto FC on Saturday (4:00 p.m.ET, ESPN+), as the teams that met in MLS Cup in 2016 and 2017 will tangle on the Sounders' home turf.Carlos Vela and Los Angeles FC might be getting the headlines, but Seattle has been equally good this season, with Nicolas Lodeiro playing the midfield maestro role to a tee and Jordan Morris and Raul Ruidiaz teaming up to score three goals each.In the back the Sounders are just as good with only three goals conceded, tops among teams in the Western Conference.Toronto FC's arrival to the Emerald City is timely, as the Canadian outfit has found its stride with the signing of Spanish attacker Alejandro Pozuelo.The team that capitulated in CONCACAF Champions League play in Panama back in February is a distant memory, and it would be hard to name a more dangerous team in the Eastern Conference than the Reds.There is also nothing more fun than rumors of a big-name European player possibly coming to MLS during the summer, and TFC has given us just that in the form of a possible Arjen Robben arrival.Right now only "exploratory talks" have materialized between the two parties, which means we all get to ask and wonder about it for the next several weeks until the discussions are officially dead.In the meantime, it should be plenty fun to watch TFC try to do its stuff against its old final foe.
Liverpool must keep energy high to beat Chelsea; Man Utd need to drop Young:::::W2W4 previews the weekend's Premier League action by highlighting its most compelling storylines ... Will Liverpool have the emotional energy to beat Chelsea?Jurgen Klopp could hardly have asked for a better result from Liverpool's Champions League tie with Porto on Tuesday, ahead of their game against Chelsea this weekend.It was a straightforward 2-0 win without much drama, which is the sort of thing they needed given some of their previous games: even the 3-1 victory over Southampton the previous Friday was a tense affair, until Mohamed Salah decided he was going to cut through the treacle and score what turned out to be the decisive goal.All of that will take its toll.The physical exertion that this frantic stage of the season demands is one thing, but the emotional energy that Liverpool's players will have to invest is another entirely, which is a particularly pertinent point given so few of them have been involved in a Premier League title race before.It helps that Klopp has more options available to him now, and options will help conserve energy.More or less everyone in his squad is now fit, or close to fitness, with Joe Gomez returning to the bench for the Porto game and even Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain playing in a behind closed doors friendly.It's another bonus that Naby Keita finally seems to be settling at Anfield, and the midfield that started on Tuesday -- Keita, Fabinho and Jordan Henderson -- has a nice balance to it.In short, everything seems to be falling into place for the helter skelter last few weeks of the season.The most significant X factor is whether Liverpool have the energy -- both physical and emotional -- to keep pace with and outstrip Manchester City.Maybe Sarri was right about Hudson-Odoi While the irritation over Callum Hudson-Odoi's relative lack of involvement in a frustrating season is understandable, you wonder if those of us who have criticised Maurizio Sarri over his handling of the youngster owe him an apology.Hudson-Odoi is, after all, still only 18, so even if his talent is clear and his pal Jadon Sancho is ripping things up in Germany, being cautious with his development and easing him into the first-team is entirely responsible.The consternation has come because Chelsea's performances have been so lacklustre, and when that happens it's natural to look at a young, exciting option because it's something different.It's essentially an emotional reaction, whereas Sarri has been logical, and after being left out of their Europa League win on Thursday, he's set to start at Anfield against Liverpool.Maybe Sarri was right after all.play 1:22 Sarri was right to rest his stars for Liverpool The ESPN FC panel agreed with Maurizio Sarri's squad selection in the Europa League, saving Chelsea's big guns for Liverpool on Sunday.Time for Solskjaer to drop Young You always take player ratings with a pinch of salt, but when the Manchester Evening News gave Ashley Young 1/10 for his performance against Barcelona on Wednesday, they weren't being hyperbolic.Few United players were good, but Young was awful.Since Young shifted to the role of full-time defender, he's had the zeal of a convert when it comes to the more -- how shall we put this -- "physical" aspects of the game: It's been as if he's trying to prove he's a proper full-back by kicking, pulling and pushing people at every opportunity.Initially, he did that as well as defending properly, but of late it has felt like the dark arts are all he really has.Two bookings in five minutes at Wolves on April 2 led to a red card that means he will miss Saturday's game vs. West Ham, which should give Solskjaer a chance to play the promising Diogo Dalot on the right side of defence.With Kane out, can Spurs afford to risk his replacement?There is always a temptation to instinctively hit the panic button on Tottenham's behalf when Harry Kane's ankle goes again, and it is of course a significant concern that this is his fifth such injury in the last three seasons.But they've been broadly fine without him this season: they won the four league games he missed after the turn of the year, and also beat Borussia Dortmund in that spell although they did also exit both domestic cups.Son Heung-min is a better deputy for a team's best player than most can expect, but when Kane is out he becomes even more valuable to this Tottenham side.Mauricio Pochettino's most significant dilemma ahead of the weekend's game against Huddersfield is whether he can afford to risk Son with stiffer tests ahead, while at the same time not being complacent about crucial Premier League points.They should be fine against the relegated Terriers if Pochettino himself played up front, but their recent patchy league form might leave doubts in the manager's mind.It might be prudent to protect Son against the risk of losing him as well.Cardiff's fate could be decided If you judge how big games are by how important they are to the teams involved, then Cardiff's next two fixtures eclipse any Champions League game in the offing.They face Burnley on Saturday, then Brighton on Tuesday, knowing that unless they win at least one of them then their prospects of relegation can be upgraded from probable to almost certain.Neil Warnock's side are currently five points from safety, behind Southampton and Brighton, and the latter is the side they're most likely to catch.First come Burnley, and the game is nearly as big for them.Sean Dyche's side have recovered from a potentially fatal nosedive to win the last two games, but they're not entirely safe yet: one more victory will be enough, and against Cardiff is their best chance of getting it, considering their remaining four games are against Chelsea, Manchester City, Everton and Arsenal.Relegation might not quite rest on this one game, but it's one neither side can realistically afford to lose.
Analysis: All smiles, but the Ferrari-Mercedes battle looks finely poised in China:::::SHANGHAI, China -- The performance advantage between Mercedes and Ferrari swung massively between Australia and Bahrain, but the early signs are that it might level out in China.Despite Ferrari's strong performance two weeks ago in Bahrain, reliability issues scuppered Charles Leclerc's first shot at a race win, and despite fixes being rolled out across the Ferraris and Ferrari-powered Haas cars in China, there are still signs that the car is fragile."I think it swings a little bit," Toto Wolff said of the competitive situation ahead of the third round of the season."It was us in Melbourne overall: car, chassis and engine.In Bahrain it was chassis on our side, but the engine clearly on the Ferrari side and here from the first session you can see that the Italian horses work.So we need to find some performance, but on the chassis side it will be a tough fight between us."Over a single lap there was just 0.027s between the fastest Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas and the fastest Ferrari of Sebastian Vettel.Interestingly, they both had bad weekends relative to their teammates in Bahrain, but already appear to have hit the ground running in Shanghai.Nevertheless, Vettel is convinced there is more time to come if he can get the car more to his liking ahead of qualifying."It's getting better but it's not 100 percent yet," he said."If you feel that it's still stuck here and there, you can't be completely satisfied.But all in all it was okay.At least we know where it is still stuck.It remains to be seen whether we will find it."Meanwhile, the stars of Bahrain, Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, both made mistakes on their hot laps that left them 0.8s and 0.7s off their respective teammates.Leclerc lost most of his time in the final sector when he had to back completely off the throttle when running wide in the final corner.It was only a minor misjudgement and the rest of the lap looked fairly clean, but getting out of the throttle on the drag to the finish line was costly and he paid the price by finishing the session seventh fastest.Lewis Hamilton's spin during second practice highlighted the reigning world champion's unhappiness with his current set-up.Charles Coates/Getty Images Hamilton's problems cost him less time to the top two, but look more concerning.Throughout the lap he was struggling with understeer -- when the car does not react to the driver's steering inputs -- delaying him getting on the throttle out of turn three and nine, while also causing him to miss the apex by over a metre at Turn 14.It looks like an inherent setup problem with the car and one that he will be working hard to dial out overnight."I would say the car in general is not that easy to drive," Hamilton said."But we are going to work on it tonight to find some tweaks and see what we can do tomorrow.This track has gone from being my strongest track to not being a strong circuit at all, so I have got a lot of work to do.But obviously the car has got the pace in it to compete at the front, so I just have to figure it out."As was the case in Bahrain, Ferrari still has a clear advantage over Mercedes on the straights.In a back-to-back comparison with similar corner exit speeds from Turn 13, Vettel was clocked 12km/h faster than Hamilton at the end of the kilometre-long back straight.The overall power advantage amounts to lap time advantage of 0.3s from that straight alone, underlining the collective power of those extra Italian horses Wolff referenced.But given the impressive cornering performance shown by Bottas, the extra pace Vettel thinks is in the Ferrari, Hamilton's propensity to bounce back from a poor Friday and the relative unknown of Leclerc, the battle for pole should still be interesting.Long run performance Sebastian Vettel arrived in China under pressure following a mistake at the Bahrain Grand Prix but started strongly in Friday practice.DIEGO AZUBEL/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Amid fears of more reliability problems, Ferrari were forced to end Charles Leclerc's session early and to allow the mechanics to strip down the car's cooling system.If Ferrari has an obvious weakness right now it is reliability and the precautionary measures on Friday meant Leclerc missed out on his usual race simulation at the end of second practice.Reliability is becoming a touchy subject at Ferrari following Leclerc's problem in Bahrain.The issue, which cost Leclerc the race win two weeks ago, was traced to a short circuit in the control unit for one of the engine's fuel injectors and has required the team to roll back an upgrade to its control electronics."Reliability is a big challenge," team principal Mattia Binotto acknowledged on Friday even before the cooling issue on Leclerc's car emerged."We know that reliability is key and we need to be perfect on that and it didn't happen in Bahrain."The problem we had was a problem we understood and was isolated to a unit.What we did here in China is revert to an old specification, a specification we know pretty well and we have good statistics in terms of quality and hopefully that will be sufficient."Reliability aside, it is not yet clear whether Ferrari will hold the same pace advantage it had in Bahrain this Sunday.On the soft tyre -- which the top running teams are likely to start the race on before switching to the hard -- Mercedes had a clear advantage.Over like-for-like lap counts on the soft compound (and with anomalous slow laps removed from the data), Bottas averaged lap times 0.3s faster than Vettel.A comparison with Hamilton's long runs isn't really fair as he started on the medium tyre when on the heaviest fuel load and then moved to softs as his fuel load came down.For the record, his average on the softs was a further 0.8s faster than Bottas but the vast majority, if not all of that gap, was down to fuel load.Championship leader Valtteri Bottas topped the order in Friday's second practice session.DIEGO AZUBEL/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock Bottas and Vettel went on to do similar runs on the hard tyres at the end of the session, but, underlining how tight it is at the front, Vettel had the edge by 0.6s on the harder compound.Part of that is likely down to fuel as Bottas switched to the hards earlier than Vettel, but it still seems odd that Mercedes should have an advantage on the softs and a large deficit on the hards.However, the two compounds require different approaches to car setup and it's possible Mercedes has started the weekend at one end of the setup spectrum and Ferrari is at the other."The biggest problem here in Shanghai, because of the characteristics of the circuit, is that if you use the hard compound or soft compound you need a car that is behaving in a different way," Pirelli's head of racing Mario Isola explained."With the soft compound you have to protect the rear tyres because you need a lot of traction in some corners.With the hard compound you cool down the tyre a lot on the long straight, especially if it is cold, and then you suffer understeer and that is causing more wear on the front.If that starts the graining, you also have degradation on the front."With the hard compound you should protect more the front than the rear because it is a lot more consistent on the rear tyre and you are not degrading the rear tyre like you are with the soft under traction.So you have these two different behaviours and ideally you would set the car up in a slightly different way for each compound.Obviously you have to find the compromise and they will decide their race strategy according to all this."With the knowledge gained from Friday practice, both Mercedes and Ferrari are likely to work towards a compromise solution that works across both compounds.That means the gaps in performance on the two compounds may not be so extreme by Sunday, but even if they exist to some it extent, it should still make for a thrilling race if Mercedes is quicker on one tyre and Ferrari on the other.
Kyle Busch on his dominant NASCAR season and becoming 'All Tracks Jack':::::On Wednesday afternoon after his eighth win at Bristol Motor Speedway, Kyle Busch washed the champagne from his clothes and started to pack for Richmond International Raceway, where this weekend he'll be racing for his ninth RIR victory and hoping for his third in a row.But first, he called in to ESPN.com to discuss making history, stealing wins, his growing fan base and pressing the flesh with politicians in a Q&A.What in the world were you doing on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, all dressed up and walking the corridors of power with Mario Andretti and Brad Keselowski?We were up there for the American Motorsports Council, spending time with some congressmen, telling stories and taking photos.We're trying to keep motorsports alive in the U.S., whether it's NASCAR, NHRA, IndyCar, SCCA, USAC, all of us.We had drivers from each of those series and just shaking hands.The rest of our people, at NASCAR for instance, are doing the dirty work.Making sure racetracks are getting the tax breaks they need to stay alive and that we are keeping up with the EPA and emissions, that kind of stuff.That right there is the really, really simple 45,000-foot explanation of it.So, if I get in a time machine and go back to little Kyle, racing go-karts with big bro Kurt in your Vegas cul-de-sac and say, "One day you will be lobbying in Washington, D.C." I would have thought you were crazy.Anyone who knows anything about me should know by now I am certainly not exactly a good politician.I am also willing to admit to you now that I never went to any classes that had anything to do political science.I just told them how it is, how I think that it is, and we'll see what they do with that.On Sunday at Bristol you scored your 54th career Cup Series win.So many of those wins were dominant.But Sunday you clearly weren't the best car and still bamboozled them.What feels better, stomping the field en route to a win or outsmarting the field en route to a win?I think a win is a win!(laughs) When you're able to dominate and just kick everyone's butt and just wipe them out, I think that's when you feel the greatest, when you put it all together.When you steal one, like we kind of did Sunday, you almost feel bad.Almost ... Yeah, almost.You're like, 'Well, we shouldn't have won.We stole one.But s---, I'll take it.We got one and we're going home!Richard Petty always says that, yes, he won 200 races, but the ones he really remembers and in a lot of cases is most famous for, are the ones he lost.That's the maddest you ever are.You're in Joey Logano's position on Sunday and you're the best guy out there, the best guy all day, and you make a bad call or your take yourself out of position or somebody at the end sneaks up and pulls something on you in order to get the win from you.Those are the ones that really sting and burn for a long, long time.Over the last few years, I feel like I've been paid back a little bit for the ones I missed out on.There were so many of those, especially early in my career.Now I'm able to steal some away.Kyle, left, and Kurt Busch are first and second in active wins at Bristol, and Kyle came out on top again this week.Jeffrey Vest/Icon Sportswire I mentioned you and big brother Kurt racing in the cul-de-sac as kids.You've raced against each other at NASCAR's highest level for 15 years now.Does it still feel good to keep him in your rearview mirror like you did at Bristol?It feels awesome to outrun anybody, but to outrun your older brother always feels good.I know how good he is at Bristol (Kyle's eight wins and Kurt's six rank 1-2 among active drivers).But what also feels good is knowing how hard he and his team have worked and that they are getting closer and closer to finally getting their win this year.But as feel good as that would be, you weren't going to let him get that win at your expense.Uh, no.Afterward he said he would have wrecked you to have gotten that win.Sure, but first you gotta catch me.(laughs) How is your relationship with race fans now?Is it starting to change?You and I have talked about the boos so many times.But you continue to win so much, that's always been what turns the tide for guys.Dale Earnhardt, Darrell Waltrip, all of them.Do you see more M&M's stuff in the stands than you used to?There's certainly more people wearing M&M's stuff.Other guys, they have one color to look for.But there are red Kyle Busch shirts, black ones, yellow, green, I have the whole rainbow of colors covered.This year there's definitely been a change.You used to always watch Dale Jr. at the racetrack and how he would just get bombarded everywhere he went, having to have people walk with him to handle all of the fans wanting autographs and all of that.I'm not saying I'm at Dale Jr.'s level by any means, but I think this year has been a lot more hectic for me getting through the garage area.I am certainly getting run over by people and asked for more autographs than I have in years past.I would assume a lot of that has to do with this season-long debate of your 200 wins versus Richard Petty's 200 wins.I'm not getting into all of that because I think it's a worn-out topic.But your Bristol win was your 54th Cup Series win.That ties you for 10th all time, with Richard's father, Lee Petty.Your next win will tie Rusty Wallace.Are you conscious of where you are on all these lists, lined up with all of these all-time legends?I'm conscious of it because you and everyone else keeps bringing it up.(laughs) It's not a bad thing.It's an honor.But people keep asking me, 'Well, what do you think about it?'I think it's great and it's cool right now, but if I'm being honest ... s---, I'm looking at second or third on that wins list.That's what I want to shoot for.That's where I want to be.Let's talk about when I'm done, when I'm retired, and we'll see how cool it is wherever I end up.I hate when people throw around the word "historic" too much.But a man who is leaping up the wins list like you are, that's historic.If my career were over today due to unforeseen circumstances, then I would feel pretty good about what I've been able to do and accomplish.It's been an awesome ride.But we aren't done.Going to Richmond this weekend.Since we've already talked about Hall of Fame names, here's some more.If you win Saturday night, you'll become just the fourth driver to win three in a row at Richmond.The others are Petty, David Pearson and Bobby Allison.Your seventh win there would tie you with Allison for second all time (Petty has 13).What is it about that place you love so much?It reminds me a lot of the track in Vegas where I used to race Legends cars as a kid.The Bullring, the one outside Las Vegas Motor Speedway?That's the one.These cars are so different, obviously, but the rhythm feels the same.It's amazing how your memory gets imprinted like that.It's a feeling.Some of these we have in the Cup Series, they have a road racing background.We only run two road races a year, but they are really good at the road races because they have a feel.A way of knowing how to go fast at those places.There's an old racing saying "He's just a One Track Jack."There's a guy who is only good at one particular racetrack.He toured the whole schedule, but they knew that whenever they got to that one track, all of the sudden he's the damn man.That was always my biggest fear, to be one of those, to never be a One Track Jack.Now you have 54 Cup wins on 23 different tracks, all of them but one.Not bad, right?My goal has always been to be known as a racer who is diverse, someone who can go to any venue and any racetrack anywhere and compete for a win.All Tracks Jack.That's right.You got it.
NASCAR StatWatch -- Taking stock of Kyle Busch's legacy:::::It's only April, and it already has been a season of accomplishments for Kyle Busch.Busch catching Richard Petty's record of 200 NASCAR National Series (Cup, Xfinity and Truck series) wins is old news.He already has flown by that, now with 204 wins.That's almost 100 more than anybody not crowned NASCAR king, as Kevin Harvick and David Pearson are tied for third with 106 wins.So in honor of Busch's three Cup Series wins this season, here's three of the legacy-securing notes Kyle Busch has accomplished this season.Welcome to the top 10 Busch's three victories this season give him 54 for his Cup Series career.That ties him with Hall of Famer Lee Petty for 10th on the all-time list.Soon enough, he'll knock Petty out of the top 10, and then he'll tie Rusty Wallace for ninth (with 55).Then, we've got a bit of a wait, as Dale Earnhardt is eighth with 76.Editor's Picks Kyle Busch on his dominant NASCAR season and becoming 'All Tracks Jack' A Q&A with Kyle Busch on his growing popularity, stealing wins and his rivalry with his brother Kurt.But Lee Petty was 46 years old when he won his 54th race, Wallace was 44, Earnhardt was 41.Kyle Busch is just 33 years old.Of the top 10 winners in Cup Series history, only Richard Petty and Jeff Gordon were younger than Busch at the time of their 54th win.Even David Pearson was nearly a full year older than Busch when he reached 54.So where the ceiling lies depends on how Busch races as he reaches his mid-to-late 30s.Can he keep winning at this pace, or will his pace drops off, like we saw with Gordon?Busch's career win percentage is at 10.7 percent, thanks to the occasional down season earlier in his career (he won just once in 2006, 2007, 2012 and 2014).To compare, Pearson won 18.3 percent of his starts; Richard Petty won in 16.9 percent.and Jimmie Johnson is at 13.3.Of course, over the past two seasons, Busch is winning 25 percent of his starts.Regular winner Busch's first full season in the Cup Series came in 2005.He turned 20 during that season, and won twice.Even though there have been ups and downs throughout his career, Busch has won in every one of his 15 full seasons, including 2019.At 33, it's reasonable to think he can string together a few more seasons of wins.Only five drivers in series history have ever won a race in more than 15 consecutive seasons.Most recently, it was done by Johnson, who won in 16 straight from 2002-17.Before that, Wallace and Ricky Rudd both had 16-seasons streaks, running mostly simultaneously.But the top two spots on the list, not surprisingly, belong to the top two drivers all-time in wins.Pearson won a race in 17 straight seasons from 1964-80.His main rival, Richard Petty, one-upped him by winning in 18 straight seasons from 1960-77.Can anybody be joining Busch?Brad Keselowski extended his streak to nine seasons with a win earlier this year.Kevin Harvick can reach 10 straight with a win in one of the final 28 races this season.Kyle has found consistency A wreck at Bristol couldn't stop Busch from registering a win last Sunday.Busch also recovered from pit issues the previous week at Texas for a 10th-place finish.He has finished sixth or better in every other race this season.That makes Busch the first driver in 27 years to record a top-10 finish in each of the first eight races of a Cup Series season, since Terry Labonte in 1992.His streak ended at eight, however.Only three other drivers have registered a top-10 finish in at least the first eight races of the season, and they all reached double digits with their streaks Morgan Shepherd (11 straight in 1990) James Hylton (10 straight in 1972) Lee Petty (10 straight in 1955) Unfortunately for Busch, there's one thing that Labonte, Shepherd, Hylton and Petty all have in common: They didn't win the championship in their seasons.One number that seems nearly impossible to pass up -- although who knows what to expect with the other-worldly level that Busch is racing at this season -- is 3.4.That's Busch's average finish this season.It's downright silly.The last driver to finish a season with an average finish that good was road-course specialist Ron Fellows in 2004, with a 2.0 mark.But that was in one race.Not a fair sample size.Nobody has ever run a full Cup Series season and put together an average finish as good as what Busch is doing right now.The closest was Richard Petty in his remarkable 1971 season in which he won 21 of his 46 starts, with a 4.2 average finish position.Even with just eight starts this season, it's an impressive mark.Only three drivers in series history have ever had an average finish of 4.0 or better in a season in which they ran at least five races.Marvin Panch (in 12 races in 1963) and Lloyd Dane (10 races in 1957) both had 3.8 marks.The only one with a better mark than Busch's was Speedy Thompson, who had a 3.1 mark in seven starts in 1953.Rowdy Busch and Speedy Thompson, a pretty select duo.
Time to cut bait on struggling fantasy baseball players?:::::Victor Caratini hit .349 this spring for the Chicago Cubs.That didn't move the needle at all on him in terms of getting drafted.However, despite being rostered in less than 1 percent of ESPN leagues, the catcher entered play Sunday in the top 10 in terms of fantasy points earned this season.Meanwhile, Gary Sanchez hit just .211 this spring for the New York Yankees.Fantasy managers ignored this as well.Still, although he was rostered in upward of 99 percent of ESPN leagues, he entered play Sunday with fewer fantasy points than Caratini -- in three times as many starts.So, obviously, it would have made perfect sense for fantasy managers to make a roster move here, right?Everybody should have gotten up early Sunday morning and cut Sanchez in favor of Caratini before lineups locked.(Excuse me for a moment, as I rolled my eyes so hard at that statement they popped out of my head and I had to go pick them up off the floor.)Editor's Picks Weekend recap: Valuing Gary Sanchez; David Dahl injured again Reacting to hot and cold starts can be difficult, but Eric Karabell provides his take on Gary Sanchez, fresh off his three-homer game, recaps the rest of the weekend and looks ahead to Monday's games.Obviously, the sample sizes at this stage of the game are extremely small -- but because they make up the entirety of a player's statistical identity for the very young season, the outliers appear to be far more glaring than these same streaks would seem to be should they occur in mid-July.Only the biggest of Chicken Littles would have been worrying about Sanchez, and all it took was one game against a hodgepodge of Baltimore Orioles pitchers for a 3-for-6, three-homer, six-RBI afternoon to shoot him all the way up to No.1 at his position for the season -- and well past Caratini in the process.In other words, don't panic in fantasy baseball -- especially in weekly head-to-head formats, where attempts to slice the numbers to a paper-thin daily basis will more often than not lead you down the road to disaster.Nobody is suggesting that treating your lineup with a "set it and forget it" philosophy is the wisest course of action, but in terms of roster construction, barring injuries, you drafted these guys for a reason.It's way too early to be pointing fingers and looking to make any drastic overhauls.Brandon Nimmo has already been dropped in 17.6 percent of the leagues in which he was drafted.Presumably, this is because of his slow start to the season, in the form of a .103 batting average and 17 strikeouts.There are many reasons why this is too soon of a knee-jerk reaction.Just to name one, it's not as though Nimmo hasn't had similar cold streaks in the past.Last season from July 9-24, he hit just .189 with 20 K's.Over his next 20 games, he hit .328 with 13 extra-base hits and 15 runs scored.Hitters tend to have a way of working their issues out.Nimmo's ADP this season was 181.6.Ian Desmond, on the other hand, saw an ADP of 153.3, so one might assume there were higher expectations on the Colorado Rockies outfielder.Yet, even though an empty roster slot would have earned you more points than Desmond so far this season, thanks to his 15 whiffs and a grand total of negative-6 points, Desmond is still on rosters in 80.3 percent of ESPN leagues (compared to Nimmo's 66.8).This is a guy who hit an anemic .236 last season.Why is there so much more confidence with him?I don't get it.You know who else has 15 strikeouts so far in 2019?Oakland's Ramon Laureano fits that bill.Yet, even though nine of those strikeouts came in his first four games -- two of which were part of that early Japanese action -- and even though he has hit .364 over his past six starts, with a season-to-date fantasy total that checks in at 22 more points than Desmond, his rostered percentage sits at only 29.9.And, it's not as if those managers who cut Nimmo or Desmond replaced them with Laureano -- that number actually dropped by 0.6 percent over the past week.Look, baseball is a game full of ebb and flow.There are always going to be players who appear to be on the rise, and perhaps unexpectedly so.While some regression is going to hit eventually, it's certainly possible that Tim Anderson (hitting .560) and Kolten Wong (.433) have both truly taken their offensive games to the next level.It might well be worth jumping on their bandwagons.Yes, sometimes cutting bait on a struggling player before the bottom completely drops out can ward off preventable damage to your fantasy season.Feeling a bit torn about whether or not to take drastic action with the likes of Yasiel Puig, Josh Donaldson or Buster Posey is normal -- and something to consider addressing.That said, one or two bad weeks isn't always an indication of a 2019 Armageddon.Recall that Matt Carpenter was hitting just .155 with two homers at the end of April last season.All he did was hit .296 with 33 HRs from May 1 through Sept. 8 before slumping again to close out the year (.147 over his final 19 appearances).Again, ebb and flow.Patience is a virtue.Make like Fonzie.Remain cool.Starting next Monday, we'll include our top-300 rankings for the remainder of the season in this space, but we're not going to update our preseason ranks until we get just a few more games under everybody's belts.Injuries aside, there's still not enough data in place to make any wild moves in our existing evaluations.We're close, but we'll stand firm for now.Until then, here's hoping your results will be pointing up this week!

UFC president Dana White says ‘Conor McGregor will fight again’ with meeting set for ‘in a matter of days’:::::Will Dana White finally give McGregor the rematch he wants against Khabib Nurmagomedov or does he have other plans for his box office sensation When Conor McGregor retired from mixed martial arts a few weeks ago, its fair to say not too many fans bought it.As the all-time box office great in MMA and UFC by a country mile too its hard to believe McGregor would leave so much money on the table when he is just 30-years-old.2 The Notorious Conor McGregor Appearing on CNN, UFC president Dana White confirmed that McGregor will indeed step inside the octagon again.Conor McGregor will fight again, White said, adding that he was due to sit down with the Irishman for face-to-face talks to discuss the future in a matter of days.Me and Conor communicate every day.Weve been talking all this week.Things are good with Conor and I and well get something figured out soon.Conor likes to be in a position where he holds the cards and he does what he wants to do.And, you know, he and I figure out how to work together and how to make it all happen.2 Khabib Nurmagomedov tapping out Conor McGregor Reports had suggested that McGregor was going to walk away over a combination of his demand to have shares in UFC not being granted and the company refusing to give him an immediate rematch with Khabib Nurmagomedov.Of course, the Russian was McGregors last opponent back at UFC 229 last year and Notorious was comprehensively defeated by the unbeaten Eagle.Theres no doubt thats the fight that McGregor wants next, but White has seemingly suggested that the winner of Dustin Poirier and Max Holloway this Saturday at UFC 236 will face Khabib.
Liverpool vs Chelsea: Maurizio Sarri can join elite group of managers if he beats Reds at Anfield on his first visit:::::Only Louis van Gaal, Slaven Bilic and Paul Clement have managed the feat of the 32 managers who have tried Facing Liverpool at Anfield has always been challenging, but this season has proved even more difficult with the league leaders unbeaten at home thus far.In fact, Jurgen Klopps side have not lost at home in the top-flight since former Red Christian Benteke struck twice for Crystal Palace who fought back to win 2-1 in April 2017.3 Liverpool have not lost at Anfield since 2017 Chelsea are the next side to visit when they travel to Merseyside this Sunday and they will be out to spoil the party, having memorably done so before.Back in 2014, with Liverpool on the verge of an unlikely title triumph, a depleted Chelsea won 2-0 after Demba Ba capitalised on Steven Gerrards infamous slip to score, before Willian was on target in stoppage-time.This will be no easy feat for the Blues however, despite their recent resurgence under Mauruizo Sarri, which has seen them win their last three successive league matches to climb into third.LATEST PREMIER LEAGUE NEWS shameful Cundy's passionate plea for disgusting Chelsea fans to leave his beloved club Poor Raheem Sterling criticism at Euro 2016 was 'worst Ive ever seen', says Dele Alli DECISION TIME Harry Kane should consider surgery on injured ankle, surgeon claims KEY The day when the Premier League title will be won and lost for Liverpool and Man City DISAPPOINTED 'It is going to be difficult' - Pochettino doubts Kane will return this season Trouble Cardiff boss charged by FA for referee comments after Chelsea defeat PLEASE STAY One player at every Premier League who must not be sold this summer do more The punishments show authorities don't care about racism, says Watford striker Gray Should Sarri defy the odds to leave Liverpool victorious this weekend, the Italian will become just the fourth visiting Premier League manager to do so on his first trip to Anfield.Of the 32 who have tried, only Louis van Gaal in March 2015, Slaven Bilic in August 2015 and most recently, Paul Clement in January 2017, have inflicted defeat on the Reds.A Juan Mata double gave United all three points in Van Gaals maiden trip, which was also notable for Steven Gerrard being sent off 38 seconds after coming on.3 Juan Mata scored twice against Liverpool in 2015 In August that same year, the Hammers were even more emphatic in their winning margin, putting three past Simon Mignolet without reply, while there were red cards for both Philippe Coutinho and Mark Noble.Two years later, Swansea lifted themselves off the foot of the table, after edging a five-goal thriller, despite leading 2-0 courtesy of Fernando Llorentes brace.Roberto Firmino replied with his own double, but Gylfi Sigurdsson scored from close range with 16 minutes left, in what was their first ever away win at Liverpool.While Liverpool may be in great form overall, their recent Anfield record against Chelsea may cause concern among the home support.3 Liverpool last beat Chelsea at Anfield in 2012 On Sunday, they will be seeking to earn their first home success against Sarris side in seven matches, their longest ever winless run against an opponent, since they won 4-1 back in May 2012.If Liverpool are to get those elusive three points against Chelsea, on paper it would be their toughest match of the five they have remaining out of the way, it would give them a considerable advantage towards pipping Manchester City and winning the Premier League.

Harry Kane: Tottenham and England striker may require surgery on injured ankle, surgeon claims:::::The 25-year-old striker suffered a 'significant lateral ligament' injury in his left ankle during Spurs' 1-0 Champions League win over Manchester City Tottenham and England striker Harry Kane may have to consider having surgery on his injury plagued ankle, a leading surgeon has claimed.Kane suffered a significant lateral ligament injury in his left ankle during Spurs 1-0 Champions League win over Manchester City and, although the club have yet to put a timescale on his return, he is unlikely to play again this season.2 Harry Kane came out second best in a 50-50 tackle with Fabian Delph on Tuesday night The Three Lions skipper is susceptible to ankle ligament damage as this is his fifth such injury since 2016 and the second to his left joint this year.Surgeon Mark Davies, a leading specialist at the London Foot and Ankle Centre who has operated on Premier League footballers, says that going under the knife could help restore the strength of Kanes ligament to what it was before his first injury.However, the 25-year-old would face a three-month spell on the sidelines if surgery was decided the best cause of action.At some point I think they would think about doing something surgically to stabilise the ligament, which is quite feasible and should restore the problem happening in the long term, Mr Davies told Press Association Sport.2 Kane is facing a spell on the sidelines I would certainly talk to him about the what advantages of having surgery would have.If he wasnt playing football and he wasnt going over on it then I wouldnt do anything about it but every time you turn your ankle you run the risk of lateral ligament damage in the ankle.Hes not that old, he could do with a stable ankle if he wants to carry on playing long term without it happening again.It is a routine operation because the ligament needs to be tightened up and that is fairly easy.If he were to have surgery, the surgeon would almost certainly use an internal brace, which is a device which you put over the ligament repair and it is incredibly strong.LIVE ON talkSPORT talkSPORT is your home of live football!Here's what's coming up on talkSPORT and talkSPORT 2...

Dillian Whyte COLUMN: Why Anthony Joshua loss was the best thing that happened to me:::::In the latest instalment of the British boxing star's exclusive column for talkSPORT.com, he explains life in the amateurs, the genesis of his rivalry with Anthony Joshua and what he learned from his professional loss to him Boxing is a bit of a happy accident for me.In 2008, I got to the stage in my kickboxing career where I had to learn to use my hands a little bit better.So I sought out a boxing coach and he brought me to the gym once a week just to learn just how to use my hands mainly to stop dropping them because I was relying on my feet too much.Then, one thing led to another and I was suddenly sparring at the gym.Before long the coach was saying youve got a lot of attributes, with your strength and power you should take this seriously and you could do something.I wasnt really serious about boxing but I started doing it more and more and I thought cool, Im actually alright at this.Then I started sparring the likes of David Haye, Tyson Fury, David Price and I wasnt getting knocked out.That sparked something in me.3 Dillian Whyte in talkSPORT studios It took a while to adapt from wanting to kick people to boxing, and Im still adapting even now.Its given me a different advantage in boxing to nearly every other fighter.Its given me a slightly awkward style that works in my favour sometimes.I have an awkwardness that works in my strength and helps deliver my power punches from angles I shouldnt really be able to.Its not a traditional approach to boxing.Its not like Im going to do this and Im going to do that Ive got a whole completely different mindset to other boxers.I had been training for about two or three months when my amateur coaches told me to get ready for a fight.It was for an end of year show which they often do to help provide funds for the boxing clubs to buy bikes, gloves and all that stuff.They couldnt really find anyone to fight me but then they said theres a guy from Finchley I think he was 4-0 or 5-0 or something who wanted to fight.The guys wouldnt stop raving on about him and said were not sure if youre ready for that.LATEST BOXING NEWS COME ON OVER Lomachenko wants to fight in the UK;

Sasha Banks tried to quit WWE following WrestleMania 35 but the company refused:::::The Boss was reportedly furious with the company and her future appears to be up in the air Rumours have been rampant in the past few months that several WWE stars are prepared to leave the company since All Elite Wrestlings inception.However, the latest desired departure has nothing to do with AEW and everything to do with WWE.1 Sasha Banks came close to beating Ronda Rousey at the Royal Rumble Multiple outlets are reporting that Sasha Banks tried to quit the company following WrestleMania 35.Dave Meltzer says, via NoDQ, Banks was furious with her and Bayley having to drop the Womens Tag Team titles at WrestleMania and she was under the impression that they would be given a decent run to establish the titles and give them credibility.Sean Ross Sapp of Fightful has said that WWE has no intention of letting Banks out of her contract and they are hoping Banks initial fury will die down.LATEST WWE NEWS rumour round-up WWE gossip column: Seth Rollins' and Roman Reigns' next feuds revealed rumour round-up WWE gossip column: All Elite Wrestling set to announce historic TV deal Cheerio WWE superstar Bray Wyatt posts the perfect goodbye message to Dean Ambrose PUNK'D CM Punk tells WWE Kofi Kingston's WWE title win 'shouldve happened ten years ago' Team Xtreme The Hardy Boyz have won the SmackDown Tag Team titles from The Usos rumour round-up WWE gossip column: Dean Ambrose's next move, the real plan for WM35 finish MAC WANTS MAC Conor McGregor hints at WWE run - Stephanie McMahon has replied to him Goodbye Full transcript of Rollins' tribute to Dean Ambrose and Ambrose's farewell speech rumour round-up WWE gossip column: Rousey has made her final WWE appearance for a long time #ThankYouDean The Shield have 'curtain call' after Raw goes off the air Essentially, WWE has given Banks a few weeks to cool down and to save her making a rash decision.Earlier this week, Banks cancelled an appearance on the Wendy Williams show at the very last minute for what she stated was a family emergency.Since then, she has been shown in posts on Instagram holidaying with her partner and Kalisto and his partner.Thats led to some fans questioning whether Banks just decided to no-show the appearance because she was angry with the WWE.Its understandable that Banks might be angry if the WWE have gone back on their word and, more importantly, they probably were the right team to establish those titles.In the end, they only got a five-week run and did not get a chance to defend the belts on all brands like they insisted they would.

more The punishments show authorities don't care about racism, says Watford striker Gray Arsenal Sokratis While it is unlikely the Greece defender will be departing the Emirates this summer, clubs would have noticed how quickly he has settled into Premier League life.Arsenal have few leaders among their ranks, but the thickset centre-back dictates by his actions and relishes the art of tackling and blocking like few others.21 Can Sokratis command the Arsenal backline to a top four return?Bournemouth Nathan Ake A key part of Eddie Howes set up, the Dutchman has established himself as one of the best defenders in the top-flight since he left Chelsea two years ago.Knowing his potential, the Blues inserted a buy-back option into his contract, while Manchester United have also reportedly been keeping tabs on Ake.21 Ake left Chelsea two years ago Brighton Solly March It has been another consistent season for the 24-year-old, who has been a steady presence in the Seagulls midfield.Netted his first ever Premier League goal in the 2-1 loss to Chelsea and also scored in the FA Cup quarter-final.There has been talk of the former Fulham winger being linked with Arsenal this summer.21 Solly March scored in the FA Cup quarter-final Burnley James Tarkowski The 26-year-old is a mainstay at the heart of the Burnley defence and his consistent performances have helped him break into Gareth Southgates England side, winning two caps.Back in January, he was linked with a move to Liverpool, when their defence was depleted through injuries and it remains to be seen if they will come back in for him this summer.21 Gareth Southgate is a huge admirer of James Tarkowski Cardiff Sol Bamba It remains to be seen if Cardiff will stay up, but if they do, they will hope to keep hold of their defender.Bambas season was cruelly ended by a knee injury and he has started all but one of their league matches this season.Despite playing at the back, the 34-year-old is their joint top scorer with four goals.Cardiff may have already been down without Bambas contributions.21 Sol Bamba has been key for Cardiff Chelsea Callum Hudson-Odoi While it seems inevitable Chelsea will lose Eden Hazard to Real Madrid this summer, it is important they look to the future and Hudson-Odoi, they have a real talent on their books.Wanted by Bayern Munich in January, the England international has given no indication he is prepared to sign a contract extension and the German giants remain confident he will join at some point.21 Hudson-Odoi remains a target for Bayern Crystal Palace Aaron Wan-Bissaka The right-back keeps turning in fine performances and has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Tottenham.The 21-year-old has made more tackles (115) than any other defender in the Premier League in 2018/19 and along with Wilfried Zaha, is one of Palaces most valuable players.21 Wan-Bissaka has been a standout performer for the Eagles this term.Everton Richarlison Eyebrows were raised when the Brazilian moved from Watford for 40million last summer, but while that fee may be extortionate, he has been Evertons best attacker this season and has 12 Premier League goals.The ex-Hornet has been linked with a move to AC Milan, with Everton saying they will only listen to offers in the region of 60million.21 Richarlison has been in fine goalscoring form for club and country this season Fulham Ryan Sessegnon Still only 18, the England Under-21 star is easily Fulhams most valuable asset.While he may have found his first season in the Premier League a gruelling one, there is no doubting his potential, which he showed in abundance, as he helped the Cottagers return to the top flight last season.With the Cottagesr already relegated, Sessegnon is likely to be targeted by Tottenham once more and the club have been keeping tabs on him for the past couple of seasons, as he would help bolster their home-grown talent.21 Sessegnon is wanted by Spurs Huddersfield Town Aaron Mooy In a woeful season for the Terriers, the few bits of quality they have displayed has come from Mooy.The Australian has shown he is capable of mixing it in the Premier League over the past couple of years and unsurprisingly is a target for a number of bigger clubs.Everton, Newcastle and West Ham are all said to be interested come the end of the campaign.21 Mooy has shown he can play in the Premier League Leicester City James Maddison Arsenal have continuously been mentioned as the midfielders next club once Aaron Ramsey departs, after his encouraging displays in his maiden Premier League season.It would be a real blow if Maddison were to leave for the Emirates, given he has six assists and seven goals and it would be a second consecutive summer the Foxes have parted with their main creative force, having let Riyad Mahrez leave for Manchester City in 2018.21 Maddison has been linked with Arsenal Liverpool Sadio Mane The Senegal star has been the standout player from Liverpools celebrated front three of Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino this season.Mane has 20 goals in all competitions and has helped send Liverpool to the top of the Premier League and have one foot in the Champions League semi-final.It appears he could leave for Real Madrid now that Zinedine Zidane is back in charge.21 Mane has been in great form this season Manchester City Raheem Sterling Zidane is planning a major overhaul this summer in his second spell at Real Madrid and Sterling is very much an intended target.The England winger has netted 15 league goals and added nine assists in what has been a excellent campaign for him and his form has also pushed him into contention for the Player of the Year.21 Man City star Raheem Sterling is wanted at Real Madrid Manchester United David De Gea Another player high on the Real Madrid radar and this one has been rumoured for a number of seasons now.De Gea has starred in goal for Man United since joining back in 2011 and has become one of the best in the world and if he were to move, it would severely hamper their chances of winning major honours once more.21 David De Gea has been at United since 2011 Newcastle Martin Dubravka Having initially impressed on loan from Sparta Prague, Newcastle moved swiftly to sign the goalkeeper permanently in the summer and he has been one of their bright spots in another season, which has seen them again flirt with relegation.He has caught the eye of Juventus and Newcastle will be desperate to keep hold, knowing they have a better chance of survival or promotion with him between the sticks.21 Martin Dubravka has been linked with a move to Juventus Southampton James Ward-Prowse The midfielder has come back into favour and form under Ralph Hasenhuttl after being left on the sidelines by Mark Hughes.Consecutive free-kicks against Manchester United and Tottenham added to all-round excellent displays to earn him a second England cap.He had been linked with a move to the Bundesliga earlier in the campaign, while Watford were said to have considered making a bid too.21 James Ward-Prowse has been in great form Tottenham Christian Eriksen Spurs have a number of top class players in their side, including Harry Kane and Dele Alli and Eriksen is right up there and could rightly consider himself the best.The Dane is a classy player, never rushed, who makes the Spurs midfield tick and Real Madrid have already identified him to replace Luka Modric.21 Real Madrid are eyeing a move for Christian Eriksen Watford Abdoulaye Doucoure The powerful midfielder has been a standout performer for the Hornets over the past couple of seasons, and he was named the clubs Player of the Season for 2017/18.While his displays have been slightly more inconsistent this term, he is still a driving force in this Watford side when in the mood and earlier this year, was a shock target for both PSG and Chelsea.21 Doucoure had captured the interest Chelsea and PSG West Ham Declan Rice England new boy Rice is one of the Hammers and Premier Leagues brightest young talents and his performances have caught the eye of both Manchester clubs, according to reports.The 20-year-old has won two caps for the Three Lions after swapping international allegiance from Republic of Ireland.Despite signing a new contract in December, West Ham fear a top six side would more than be able to improve on his 40,000-a-week salary.21 Rice has been consistent for West Ham this season and earned two England caps Wolves Ruben Neves Since moving from Porto in 2017, the Portugal international has

The Masters 2019: Hole-by-hole guide to Augusta National as Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose eye glory:::::Here's what the pros will face when they battle it out for the green jacket this week The Augusta National is home to some of the most famous holes in golf and they will be on show once again with The 2019 Masters upon us.From Fire Thorn to Azalea and dont forget Flowering Crabapple every hole is familiar and provides the perfect setting for the first Major of the year.Heres how the pros will tackle all 18 and The Masters memories that have been made over the years.1st Plays as one of the hardest holes on the course thanks to the subtle undulations of the green and magnet-like bunker on the right of the fairway.The first tee shot is also one of the most nerve-wracking shots of the round, so hit a bad one and it could set the tone for the rest of the day.2nd This hole can throw up everything from an albatross to a bogey and is one of the most exciting on the course.Players need to hit a raking draw off the tee and feather the second shot up the narrow shoot at the front of the green.3rd If the wind is blowing strong from behind and conditions are firm underfoot then the longest hitters will smash a driver up near the green.If they dont then it is all about laying up to a yardage that suits them for a wedge second shot to a hole where they will look for birdie.4th The green is a massive target but players will be going in with a long iron and need to hit the correct part of the putting surface to leave themselves a look at birdie and par.Danger lurks all around but it is better to miss it in the bunkers short because then players will be hitting back into a green that slopes towards them.5th This hole is long, uphill and a dogleg to the left that forces players to hug the left side of the sloping fairway while avoiding the bunkers, which require a carry of 315 yards to miss.A demanding par four, it has been lengthened by 40 yards this year and was inspired by the legendary Road Hole at St Andrews.6th Players will use a mid iron to hit down the slope to this undulating green, which can throw up a number of pin positions.There used to be a stream in front of the green but that was taken out and now there remains a solitary bunker to gobble up a mishit shot.7th Drives need to find the fairway here so players have ultimate control over spin for their second shots.Five traps guard the green but, because pros will be going in with a short or mid iron, birdie is a decent shout on this hole.8th An uphill hole where the bunker on the right side of the fairway must be avoided if competitors want to reach the green in two.The second shot will need to be a draw played around the trees to a long thin green which throws up the chance of an eagle.9th A drive down the right side of the fairway gives the best angle into this green which slopes severely from back to front.Players will need to watch the amount of spin on their second shots because even one which lands safely on the green could end up rolling back down the fairway.10th This monster par four plays less than it yardage because of how steeply downhill it is.Again a draw needs to be played off the tee with anything from a driver to a long iron but the difficulty doesnt end there, with a sloping green another reason why this hole typically plays as the toughest on the course.11th Kneel down and say a little prayer, because this is the start of Amen Corner.The tee shot is downhill and needs to be hit from left to right.The second shot must avoid the pond short left of the green.Banks on the right can be used as a bail out.Par is a great score on the courses hardest hole.12th One of the worlds most famous holes.To quote Arnold Palmers wider saying on golf in general, the 12th at Augusta is deceptively simple yet endlessly complicated.The swirling winds make club selection absolutely pivotal and Raes Creek sits short of the bunker and green.The bank will funnel any balls hit short back into a watery grave.13th A right to left tee shot for right handers opens up a shot to a green guarded by a tributary to Raes Creek and four bunkers not to mention a huge flowerbed behind.Another brilliant risk/reward hole, this one arguably more than any other has been responsible for determining who ends up with the green jacket and has had everything from Phil Mickelsons astonishing shot from behind the trees to Tiger Woods putting into the water.14th Completely devoid of bunkers, this holes defence is its nerve-racking green which will test even the steadiest of hearts and hands.The putting surface slopes significantly from left to right and every putt on it needs to be treated with the utmost respect.15th This hole is all about the second shot.Players need to carry the water short, avoid the bunker on the right and not go long over the back, where more water awaits.Like all of Augustas par fives, eagle here is just as likely as a bogey and it throws up many heart-in-your-mouth moments coming so late in the round.16th If you put your money on there being a hole in one in the Masters, then chances are it will come here.Competitors will go in with a short to mid iron to a green that slopes heavily from right to left.The pin is often placed where balls naturally gather but dont go too far left into the water.17th The tee shot and second shot should provide the pros with few troubles but its a different story when they get to the green.It slopes off in all directions and, should a player miss it, then there is no such thing as an easy up and down for par.18th One of golfs most iconic tee shots, players will rip a driver or 3-wood through a narrow shoot of trees while hoping to avoid the sand on the left.The green is split into two distinct tiers and is protected by a bunker short and another on the right, which will see a lot of action over the week.* Picture credit

Arsenal team news: Mesut Ozil to miss out? Predicted Gunners line-up for crucial Europa League clash at home to Napoli:::::Unai Emery said his side need to win the quarter-final first leg at the Emirates Stadium to stand any chance of going through but who will get the nod from the manager?Arsenal will be keen to bounce back from their weekend slump at Everton as they welcome Napoli to the Emirates Stadium in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-final tie.The Gunners were sloppy against the Toffees as they went down to a 1-0 defeat putting a dent in their hopes of finishing in the top four.5 Arsenals hopes of reaching the top four suffered a setback However, winning the Europa League is another route into next seasons Champions League and given Unai Emerys aptitude for this competition (winning it three years running at Sevilla 2014-16), Arsenal will certainly be taking this game very seriously.But in order to reach the semi-finals, they must beat one of the favourites to win the competition in Napoli, who very nearly made it out of their Champions League group where they were pitted against Paris Saint-Germain and Liverpool.Emery is aware of the danger Napoli possess with world-class players including Manchester United target Kalidou Koulibaly and Dries Mertens.5 Koulibaly and Mertens will be looking to end Arsenals Europa League campaign In fact, Emery has said his side need to win the first leg especially due to Arsenals poor away record in the knockout stages this season which has seen them lose to BATE Borisov and Rennes.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is set for a recall to the Arsenal starting XI having only been on the bench for his sides last two matches after being ill with a virus.He looks set to join Alexandre Lacazette in attack while Mesut Ozil could miss out again with Aaron Ramsey set to return.Juventus-bound Ramsey was only fit enough to play the second-half of their defeat at Goodison Park due to a groin problem.5 Emery admits Arsenal need to win the first leg Laurent Koscielny (foot) and Granit Xhaka (groin) face late fitness tests having not featured at the weekend.So how might Arsenal line up for their first match against the Serie A giants?Below you can see talkSPORT.coms predicted XI.5 Is this the side Emery will field against the Neapolitans?A 3-4-1-2 formation could be the tactics Emery goes for as he looks to go for the win but also have plenty of defenders back for Napolis dangerous attack.Petr Cech starts in goal as hes Arsenals cup keeper and he may well be joined by a defensive three of Shkodran Mustafi, Laurent Kosicleny and Sokratis Papastathopoulos.Meanwhile, wing-backs Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Sead Kolasinac will be able to support the defenders when the visitors are on the ball but will also give Arsenal width going forward.LATEST FOOTBALL NEWS shameful Cundy's passionate plea for disgusting Chelsea fans to leave his beloved club DEFYING THE ODDS Can Maurizio Sarri join elite group by achieving Anfield 'first'?Poor Raheem Sterling criticism at Euro 2016 was 'worst Ive ever seen', says Dele Alli out of contract Ander Herrera will 'give his all' for Man United despite uncertainty a town called ayr McCoist delivers hilarious rendition of Fresh Prince of 'Bel Ayr' rap REVEALED How often every Premier League team has been first on Match of the Day this season GOING THE DISTANCE Why Arsenal's Europa League tie with Napoli may well go to extra-time DECISION TIME Harry Kane should consider surgery on injured ankle, surgeon claims The Gunners missed Granit Xhakas passing at Everton so if hes fit enough, he is likely to play and Lucas Torreira is in contention to make a timely return in what is arguably Arsenals biggest game of the season so far.Aaron Ramsey has performed well this season so will surely play and Emery could be tempted to play both Aubameyang and Lacazette as the two forwards work well together.This means the inconsistent Mesut Ozil may miss out as defensive duties will be a requirement in this match and the No.10 just cannot be relied on to do that.
Tottenham news: Stats suggest Heung-Min Son is more important than Harry Kane as striker faces spell on the sidelines with injury:::::The South Korean scored on Tuesday after Kane was taken off with a potentially season-ending ankle injury Harry Kanes season could be over, but that does not mean Tottenham Hotspur should start planning their summer holidays already.The top scoring striker suffered a nasty looking ankle injury against Manchester City in the Champions League on Tuesday and left the ground on crutches with a protective boot.4 Heung-min Son is expected to be Tottenhams main man until the end of the season Immediately after the enforced substitution however, Spurs took the lead through Heung-Min Son and have a 1-0 lead to defend at the Etihad next week.The South Korean stepped up for his side when it mattered most as he did against Crystal Palace in the previous home game and Mauricio Pochettino will take heart from that.Statistically speaking, Spurs have actually been better off without their prolific no.10 this season.After a stellar World Cup in Russia, Kane has continued to score the goals for his club, with his 17 in the Premier League bettered only by Sergio Aguero, Mohamed Salah and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.Sky Sports 4 Harry Kanes injury does not look good However, in the 25-year-olds absence, Spurs have won 67 per cent of their games as opposed to 62 per cent with the Englishman.Spurs have lost 12 times with the striker on the pitch this season in all competitions.Conversely, stats reveal the softly-spoken forward known affectionately as Sonny has carried his side to decisive victories and makes the north Londoners a better side.With 19 goals to his name already, Son will be expected to lead the line in Kanes absence, should he miss the rest of the season.And, as we can see from the graphic below, it is a role he is more than accustomed to.4 Son is now likely to be the leading man for Spurs until the end of the season 4 Pochettino is likely to turn to the 26-year-old to spearhead the attack for Spurs When Kane suffered an injury to the ligaments of his same joint back in January, Spurs won five of their next seven without him, with Son scoring in four successive games after returning from the Asian Cup.When given a starting role by Pochettino, Son has scored 65 goals from 126 games since joining from Bayer Leverkusen in August 2015.The Lilywhites are currently fourth in the table and, if they are to reach the semi-finals of Europes elite competition and qualify for next years tournament, will need their unsung hero to step up once again.

Clement Lenglet: Barcelona’s unsung hero proves himself against Manchester United one year after doing the same with Sevilla:::::Barcelona were convinced of Lenglet's talents when he starred for Sevilla at Old Trafford last season, and their risky decision to sign the centre-half has paid off With usual starter Samuel Umtiti suffering from a persistent knee problem this year, relying on a Nou Camp newcomer with only a few years top flight experience to play centre-back could have been a problem for Barcelona.Instead, Baras summer signing Clement Lenglet has looked consistently assured at the heart of their defence.Lenglet has managed to pull off an odd feat: playing 38 games for Barcelona this season without really being noticed.6 Its been a promising debut season for Lenglet at the Nou Camp But far from a sign of mediocrity, for a central defender at Bara, its a good thing.Asked to be brave under pressure, play in a high line, and spend more time in the opposition half than most centre-backs would dare, central defenders at the Nou Camp are just one mistake away from ridicule during their time on the pitch.It is a vertigo-inducing situation with pressure that experienced, quality players have buckled under.Lenglet, still only 23, looks like he has been doing it for years; like he has long been playing Champions League quarter-finals.6 Lenglet has surpassed all expectations this term He hasnt.Just three years ago Lenglet was plying his trade in Frances second division with Nancy, stepping out at tiny grounds in Annecy or Dijon rather than the Theatre of Dreams or the Santiago Bernabeu.When the French minnows gained promotion to Ligue 1, Sevillas ever savvy sporting director Monchi needed only half a season to judge that the young centre-back could be good enough to make the leap up to LaLiga straight away.Monchis vision proved to be typically sound.LATEST FOOTBALL NEWS shameful Cundy's passionate plea for disgusting Chelsea fans to leave his beloved club DEFYING THE ODDS Can Maurizio Sarri join elite group by achieving Anfield 'first'?Poor Raheem Sterling criticism at Euro 2016 was 'worst Ive ever seen', says Dele Alli out of contract Ander Herrera will 'give his all' for Man United despite uncertainty a town called ayr McCoist delivers hilarious rendition of Fresh Prince of 'Bel Ayr' rap REVEALED How often every Premier League team has been first on Match of the Day this season GOING THE DISTANCE Why Arsenal's Europa League tie with Napoli may well go to extra-time DECISION TIME Harry Kane should consider surgery on injured ankle, surgeon claims KEY The day when the Premier League title will be won and lost for Liverpool and Man City breakthrough Canoville, Chelseas first black player, praises clubs response to racism DISAPPOINTED 'It is going to be difficult' - Pochettino doubts Kane will return this season Trouble Cardiff boss charged by FA for referee comments after Chelsea defeat Within 12 months Lenglet was the leader of another defence, this time at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan, dealing with the pressure at one of LaLigas most ambitious clubs like it was nothing.Accustomed to trophies and European football, Sevilla fans demand strong performances from their players every weekend, all season long.At 22, the centre-back looked completely unfazed by it all.With that kind of head on his shoulders, no wonder Barcelona moved quickly.LIVE ON talkSPORT talkSPORT is your home of live football!Here's what's coming up on talkSPORT and talkSPORT 2...

Harry Kane unlikely to play again this season, Pochettino says:::::Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has admitted it is 'difficult' for him to see Harry Kane playing again for Spurs this season, following the ankle injury he suffered during the 1-0 win over Manchester City in the first leg of their Champions League quarterfinal.On Thursday, the club confirmed the striker had undergone several medical tests, with the assessments revealing the Englishman had suffered 'significant' ligament damage in his left ankle, though they refused to offer a potential return date.And now, as quoted by BBC Sport, Pochettino has admitted he finds it unlikely that Spurs fans will see their captain in action again this season.Speaking ahead of his side's home clash with Huddersfield on Saturday, the Argentine proclaimed: "It is a little bit sad but he is looking forward to recovering as soon as possible.There is five weeks [of the season left], it is going to be difficult."The tactician then revealed the club's plans for Kane's recuperation, as well as his mindset following the setback."Next week we are going to see with the specialist," he confirmed."We are going to do everything to recover him as soon as possible but there is only five weeks of the season to recover."He was so upset after the game - it was a difficult moment for him.He is in a good place because he is a positive guy."The Lilywhites also lost Dele Alli in that European encounter to a hand fracture, though it is understood that the midfielder's ailment is far less serious, with the club revealing in their Thursday statement that he could still be in contention for Saturday's game with the Terriers.

Opening Day Playoff Odds: 16.7% Change: -13.1% The Rockies offense hasnt been simply bad.Its been truly, stupendously, jaw-droppingly terrible.The .275 OBP begins to convey this.The .323 SLG does, too.These marks are just a start, though.A more illustrative one might be the 45 OPS+, meaning that this team has collectively hit scarcely half as well as the league average.Or -1.5 FanGraphs WAR, which is exactly twice as bad as baseballs second-to-worst offense, Cleveland.Or, in lieu of another metric, a fun fact (un-fun division): David Dahl is Colorados only player currently hitting at or above the league average.There isnt a pinch-hitter who had a lone decent at-bat or a pitcher who lucked into a bloop in one of two appearances.Nope.There is Dahl, all on his own.Except, uh, Dahl is currently on the 10-day IL; in his absence, the teams best active hitter is 35-year-old Mark Reynolds, who has been coming off the bench to post a 91 OPS+.So, really then, theres nothing.Theres a dreadful slump for Nolan Arenado, a marginally less dreadful one for Charlie Blackmon, and a regular ol slump for Trevor Story.And, for now, thats it.Time To Panic?As much as one can in April, yes.Theres no way that the entire team can continue to hit quite this poorly, but if at least a few key players dont begin to snap out of it soon, they might not have many options going forward.The Rockies have already dug themselves into a fairly deep hole, and considering that they share a division with the consensus pennant favorite Dodgers, they cant really afford to dig any deeper.21.Arizona Diamondbacks 20.Detroit Tigers 19.Los Angeles Angels 18.San Diego Padres Joe Sargent/Getty Images 17.Pittsburgh Pirates Current Playoff Odds: 15.6% | Opening Day Playoff Odds: 10.1% Change: +5.5% So far, Pittsburgh has the best pitching staff in the National Leaguedefinitely, yep, just as we all expected.A 2.61 ERA (176 ERA+) (seriously, what?!)puts them atop the leaderboards here, bolstered by strong performances from Trevor Williams and Jordan Lyles.Unfortunately for the Pirates, though, this has been complemented by a lackluster offense (83 OPS+), and most of their wins so far have come against the Reds, which well, theyre wins, but how much do they really count?Are They For Real?You know, dont ask how long it will last.Enjoy it while its here.16.Cleveland Indians 15.Minnesota Twins Current Playoff Odds: 42.1% | Opening Day Playoff Odds: 35.8% Change: +6.3% Let us gather round and appreciate two players here: Jorge Polanco, Minnesotas best hitter so far, and Jos Berros, Minnesotas best starting pitcher.Polanco's young career has seen him bounce from much-hyped prospect to potential bust to post-hype sleeper to here.He's simply stopped hitting the ball on the ground.His groundball percentage has been cut in half, dropping his groundball-to-flyball ratio by a third, while his average launch angle has increased by more than five degrees.All this has translated to a 1.182 OPS, or 219 OPS+ (!), which has made him one of the five best hitters in the American League.Will this be sustainable in the long run?No.Well, at least not at this level.It sure has been fun to watch, though.As for Berros, his first three starts have seen him looking as sharp as he ever has.With a 2.18 ERA, hes walking fewer batters and giving up less hard contact.And, man, that curveball.Jos Berros, Filthy 82mph Curveball.pic.twitter.com/ncgx9ubkoY Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) April 7, 2019 Are They For Real?Minnesotas early playoff odds swing has as much to do with Clevelands struggles as it does with its own successes.The Twins have been seeing best-case-scenario outcomes from a number of their players so farPolanco and Berros, yes, but hello, slugger Mitch Garver and resurgent Byron Buxton and healthy Michael Pinedaand while all of those cant bear out, some of them likely will, in one form or another.If Cleveland continues to be vexed by injury problems, it has good reason to be afraid and, really, it might have good reason there, regardless.14.New York Mets Current Playoff Odds: 54.7% | Opening Day Playoff Odds: 39.6% Change: +15.1% Pete Alonsos true talent level does not look like a guy with a 244 OPS+.It just doesnt, because no ones does.(Okay, 2001-04 Barry Bonds, and 1920-21 Babe Ruth.Thats it.)So far, though, its just who the rookie has been.Some of this is small-sample-size messiness.Some of it is real substance.And all of it has helped the Mets 115 OPS+, the strongest offense so far in the NL East.(Other key contributors: Michael Conforto, Jeff McNeil, Statcast darling J.D.Davis.)Are They For Real?On one hand, if everyone stays healthy here, whats going to stop them?On the other hand, theyre the New York Mets; staying healthy is not their strong suit, and being stopped by baffling factors that come out of nowhere is.13.Philadelphia Phillies 12.St. Louis Cardinals Maddie Meyer/Getty Images 11.Boston Red Sox Current Playoff Odds: 61.7% | Opening Day Playoff Odds: 90.3% Change: -28.6% Its looked bad.It has.Its looked really, really, really bad.The rotation has been a disaster; Chris Sales velocity has disappeared, Rick Porcello has been a general nightmare, David Price hasnt been especially sharp.Their 8.78 ERA is the worst in baseball, and it isnt close.Bostons bullpen has been betterhow could it not be?but it can only do so much, and the offense hasnt exactly put the team in a place to succeed, either, with an 89 OPS+.(Its hardly the biggest problem here, but its almost impressive that Eduardo Nez managed to enter Friday with the rarely seen 1 OPS+.Thats not missing a digit.1.)Basically, nothing is right, and everything is varying degrees of wrong.Time To Panic?Well, panic is strong.The foundation of last years championship team is still here, after all.And beginning the season on a lengthy road trip might have made matters look worse than they would have otherwise.But theres not too much room for error in a division shared with the Yankees and Rays, and if the rotation doesnt right itself soon, Boston will be looking at an uphill battle.Lets put it this way: The 1910 Pittsburgh Pirates (86-68) hold the record for worst season by a team who won 105 or more games in the previous year.Right now, it doesnt seem crazy to think that could be matched by the 2019 Boston Red Sox.10.Chicago Cubs Current Playoff Odds: 39.2% | Opening Day Playoff Odds: 64.2% Change: -25% This, too, has looked bad.But Chicagos situation is different than Bostons.It isnt a case of struggle across the board.In fact, there hasnt been any notable struggle here at the plate.The Cubs actually have one of the strongest offenses in the National League, second only to the Dodgers in OPS+.Their pitching, however, has been another story.With 5.03 BB/9, the rotation has allowed more walks than any other.With 2.61 HR/9, its given up more dingers than any except the Red Soxs.Meanwhile, the bullpen has offered relief in name only.By FanGraphs WAR, the pitching staff has collectively been worse than every other besides the Orioles, which yikes.Time To Panic?Its statistically unlikely that the entire pitching staff will continue to be this bad.It should get better.Or, at least, one pitcher should get better.Hopefully.Still, while theyre waiting, theres only so much solace to take in the offense, and this division doesnt allow much in the way of wiggle room.So, no, its too early to panic.But its perfectly reasonable to feel the uneasy itch of growing concern.9.Milwaukee Brewers Current Playoff Odds: 35.8% | Opening Day Playoff Odds: 27.9% Change: +7.9% The Cubs losses have been the Brewers wins.(Both directly, in two out of three games in the clubs one series so far, and indirectly, in, well, everything else.)Milwaukees position atop the division looks rather precarious, though.It has the worst run differential of the five teams, despite holding down first place.Sure, run differential can easily be misleading in April, with just one blowout needed to put the figure out of whack, but Milwaukees offense (103 OPS+) has been only slightly above league average, and its pitching (91 ERA+) has been below it.This doesnt bode particularly well.Are They For Real?The Brewers rotation appeared to be a likely weak spot this winter, and so far theyve proven that true.(See: 5.64 ERA!)Unless they see a speedy return for Jimmy Nelson, or run out to grab Dallas Keuchel, there isnt reason to believe it will get much better.Thats a tough spot to be inand while this offense has the potential to carry them quite a bit, it can only do so much.8.Oakland As Current Playoff Odds: 21.2% | Opening Day Playoff Odds: 32.3% Change: -11.1% Seattles early surge has knocked a sizeable dent in Oaklands odds.The As have been perfectly fine (114 OPS+, 103 ERA+), certainly much better than they were at this time last year, but they havent been anything more than that, and perfectly fine just isnt good enough for the AL Westeven when, or if, Seattle starts to cool down.Theres plenty to enjoy here (Khris Daviss home runs, Ramon Laureanos arm, Blake Treinens slider) but, so far, there just hasnt been enough to set them apart.Which Ramn throw is your favorite?(It's OK to say both)#RootedInOakland pic.twitter.com/WMuXhpmFDp Oakland Athletics (@Athletics) April 3, 2019 Time To Panic?Nah.Its not necessarily the best place to begin the season for a team looking to grab a second straight playoff spot, but its decent enough, and theres no specific problem area crying out for attention.Beyond that, Oakland has to believe that a window of opportunity will be coming at some point, even if theres no guarantee that the team will be able to capitalize on it: The Mariners, eventually, will have to begin obeying the laws of space and time and baseball.(We think.)7.Washington Nationals 6.New York Yankees 5.Atlanta Braves Nuccio DiNuzzo/Getty Images 4.Seattle Mariners Current Playoff Odds: 16% | Opening Day Playoff Odds: 2.3% Change: +13.7% It does not make any sense that this team has done what it has.Domingo Santana, Daniel Vogelbach and Ryon Healy should not be the anchors of an offense that looks like a record-breaking slugging machine.Jay Bruce should not be on pace for 87 home runs.Tim Beckham should not be in the running for the best position player in baseball so far.Perhaps most overwhelmingly, this pitching staffminus James Paxton and Edwin Diaz, plus a year on the calendar for Flix Hernndezshould not be able to support any of this.And, yet, all of this has been happening, and Seattle has the best record in baseball.Are They For Real?Are the Mariners better than they were expected to be, after the front offices winter announcement of an upcoming rebuild?Yes.Are they this good?Ehhhh Well, if they probably wont have a 158 OPS+ forever, they definitely wont have a 108 ERA+ forever.3.Tampa Bay Rays Current Playoff Odds: 59.7% | Opening Day Playoff Odds: 28.2% Change: +31.5% The pitching staff that had to invent an entirely new role to overcome its limitations in 2018 is, so far, the gold standard for 2019.The Rays 1.98 ERA is the best in baseballjust like their 214 ERA+, 2.64 FIP and 4.59 K/BB.With the development of Tyler Glasnow, the addition of Charlie Morton, and the continued success of 2018 AL Cy Young Blake Snell, this rotation hasnt just taken a major step toward being, well, an actual full rotation its taken a step toward being an excellent one.Throw in bullpen ace Jos Alvarado, and this pitching staff is looking remarkably strong.(Its strength juuuust gives the team the edge here over Seattle.)The offenses early success hasnt been quite so radical, but with a 103 OPS+, its been perfectly solid, bolstered by strong starts from Austin Meadows and Yandy Diaz.The Rays (probably) wont have every aspect of their club stay this sharp for the rest of the year.If even half of them keep it up, though?Watch out.Are They For Real?The Rays standing in the division has, of course, benefited heavily from the Red Soxs struggle and the Yankees injuries.Will Tampa Bay stay on top of the AL East?Possibly, but it isnt likelier than not.Will it keep things close, remaining, at the very least, a serious contender?Definitely.2.Houston Astros
Karim Benzema: The Most Underrated Footballer of the 21st Century:::::Look, I get it, you're angry.You're seething with pent up rage-click fervour.You already hate me almost as much as you hate that phoney, good-for-nothing fraud of a footballer that is Karim Benzema.I get it.You've preyed on this poor, undervalued Frenchman for a while now.He's an easy target.He doesn't score 'enough' goals, doesn't step up on the 'biggest stage', doesn't carry the team on his back when the going gets 'tough'.Is it me or is Benzema a tad overrated?A goal every other game in a team as strong as Real Madrid is nada especial.Decent not great.Gary Lineker (@GaryLineker) October 17, 2017 Whether you're in the "tad overrated" (and I know you're here, Gary) camp, or the "biggest fraud in football history" one, or the "If Real Madrid Don't Sign a Replacement for Karim Benzema This Summer They're Big Stupid Idiots" one (definitely the worst of the lot), you're all waiting with belligerent, baited breath, ready to pounce.Some of you might have even prepared your arguments after Benzema scored his brace against Eibar last Saturday."It's bloody Eibar!!!!""Where was he against Valencia?!?!?!?!"Well, he did actually score in that embarrassing defeat, but I take your poin- "Well, where was his brace?!?!?!?!?"He actually has six other braces this season, but it's fine, I get it.This won't be easy.But it's fine: I also came prepared.Denis Doyle/GettyImages It essentially boils down to this: what, exactly, do you want out of Karim Benzema?Do you want him to score 30-plus goals a season?Because he did that in the first year of his 20s.Do you want him to back up his talent with trophies?Because he's done that 17 times over, and that's only the major ones.So, what do you want?Did you want him to step up to the plate after Cristiano Ronaldo, the man who he had served so dutifully in spite of himself for nine years, left for Juventus?Because, notwithstanding both the facades and the foundations crumbling around him, he's done that more than any other Real player this term; scoring 26 goals across competitions, more than double his CR7-inhibited tally from last season.Now, at any point in his career has he been the best player in the world?No.The best player in his position?Maybe, maybe not.The best player of his nation?Probably, but it's controversial and politically multi-layered, so let's not go there...although if he had a World Cup winners medal, would you still be so inflammatory?My point is, it's ok to not be the best player in the world.To not score 75 goals and 57 assists per calendar year.To not win five Ballon d'Ors in a row.FRANCK FIFE/GettyImages Thanks to that dynamic duo of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, we are constantly asking their fellow colleagues to step up, constantly reflecting their ridiculous numbers back at them in the hope that somehow they are reflected back by somebody, somewhere.No, Karim Benzema is not Leo Messi, or CR7, maybe not even Harry Kane.But he was also the starting striker for the most successful side in Champions League history.He is simultaneously the fourth greatest goalscorer in the competition's illustrious history and a player, who for the majority of his European career, has operated solely as a facilitator.He is a player who's felt the unbridled, and usually unfair, wrath of the white handkerchief-waivers at the Santiago Bernabeu, and emerged from the other side, unscathed, even...loved?He's taken all the you-can't-speak-Spanish jibes he could, and instead of crying about it to his native press in the hopes of a return (looking at you, Gareth Bale), actually buckled down, applied himself and learned at least a portion of the language.The Bale comparison is not just a snide dig at the Welshman, it is an example of how we judge superstars, and measure their plights.Whereas Bale is seen as an unfortunately spurned star at Madrid, Benzema is a racketeering fraud, who's 'sold his soul' to wear the number nine shirt at Real indefinitely.Benzema must have sold his soul to still be number 9 at Real Lawrence Bury (@lawrence_bury) March 5, 2019 A senior figure at Los Blancos recently speaking to Marca declared: "They have been criticising him for 10 years and he's the best."Who that 'they' is up for interpretation, because it seems to have been everyone in the footballing world at one point or another, but it still strikes a chord.Yet it was perhaps his everlasting idol and current boss Zinedine Zidane - who played the upbeat role in the good-cop-bad-cop routine with Jose Mourinho that the Frenchman has previously attributed to his return to form after some early struggles in Spain - who put it best.Speaking after the Eibar victory, Zidane explained: "Now you pay more attention because of the goals, but the best Benzema has been seen many more times than you think."AFP Contributor/GettyImages And that seems to perfectly sum up Benzema's legacy.In this generation, the goal return is what people will always look at when calibrating success - it's certainly what I've turned to at times in this very article.But there are other ways of defining greatness.Other moments that define a player's career.Other ways to significantly contribute to success.And maybe, just maybe, a player & manager of the calibre of Zizou is a better judge of that than you.Maybe.

Florentino Perez 'Not in Love' With Paul Pogba as Real Madrid Decide Against Expensive Transfer:::::The transfer saga surrounding Manchester United star Paul Pogba appears to have taken another dramatic turn as reports from Spain claim that Real Madrid president Florentino Perez does not feel as though the Frenchman is worth such an expensive transfer.Manager Zinedine Zidane has admitted that he is a huge fan of Pogba, prompting rumours of a potential transfer at the end of the season.However, United are reluctant to allow him to leave, and could demand a mammoth fee if Real want to pursue a deal.Gonzalo Arroyo Moreno/GettyImages The cost of this deal has left Perez unwilling to make the move as, according to El Confidencial, he is not convinced that Pogba merits such an expense.Whilst Real do like his power and leadership, they are thought to be concerned by Pogba's failure to bring these qualities to Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final loss to Barcelona.They claim he "disappeared" when it mattered most, and this is not the kind of player that club officials want at the Santiago Bernabeu.Perez has debated whether Pogba would offer an improvement to either Luka Modric or Toni Kroos, and El Confidencial claim he has now decided that Pogba would be an unreliable alternative.The Frenchman has struggled with consistency throughout the season, including a rocky start to the campaign under former boss Jose Mourinho, and is now not viewed as a player who could step up and win vital games for Los Blancos.Real do not view the United man as a future Ballon d'Or winner, so they do not want to spend heavily on a player who cannot take the team to the next level.He finished 15th in the standings for 2018's award, despite his influential role in France's World Cup triumph.Stu Forster/GettyImages Taking into consideration his transfer fee, salary demands and agent fees, Real simply do not feel Pogba is worth it.Despite their concerns, midfielder Casemiro claimed that Pogba would be a fantastic addition to the side.He said: "Pogba is compatible with any team because he's a great player.He would be welcome if he arrives.However, he's not here and we have to respect Manchester United."
Game of Thrones: Premier League Clubs Re-Imagined as GOT Houses:::::The race for the Premier League crown is coming down to the wire in the final stretch of the season, with Liverpool and Manchester City battling it out to be the side on top when it all comes to an end on May 12.Meanwhile, the race is hotting up (get it?)for the iron prize as Game of Thrones returns to our screens in a matter of days.No matter how silly, preposterous or controversial you believe some of these links may be, rest assured it took far longer to complete than I would care to admit.But, when momentous moments on television arrive, they can't be ignored.Thus, hopefully you might get a chuckle or two, or perhaps question why this was ever done.Well, blame me, it's my fault, but I do hope you enjoy the likely SPOILER FILLED list that awaits.House Targaryen - Liverpool Julian Finney/GettyImages Having lurked in the shadows for years, far away from the throne, this could well be Liverpool's time after years of banging on about former glory.Certain characters over the years have meant they weren't always liked (*cough* Diouf *cough* Viserys) however a new leader has emerged who may finally lead them to the top in Jurgen Klopp, although he isn't nearly as pretty as the Targaryen leader.House Stark - Manchester United AFP/GettyImages The loss of a truly great leader has been difficult to amend, granted in the Red Devils' case it was somewhat less gruesome, but the road to recovery has been anything but smooth.A place on the Iron Throne is beyond them, yet they have a more pivotal fight to contend against a side from foreign lands - in a battle for glory on a grander stage.House Lannister - Manchester City AFP/GettyImages Current occupiers of the throne and ever so faintly gripping hold of it at present, City's shed load of cash seemingly knows no bounds - despite having predominately come from an outside source.The amount of Financial Fair Play trouble they seem to be getting in means they do indeed 'always pay their debts', while still retaining dominance on the land.House Tyrell - Tottenham Mike Hewitt/GettyImages Money doesn't buy you happiness, but it can buy you a shiny new stadium.Just as the Tyrell's sit on a wealth of gold and riches, Spurs saved up plenty in order to construct the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium - 1bn to be exact.Having knocked on the door a couple of times in recent years, they've always fallen just short of the top, usually falling at the final hurdle.House Baratheon - Arsenal Clive Brunskill/GettyImages Previously undefeated and rulers of the lands, their fall from grace has been slow but steady.However there are faint hopes of a legitimate claim to the throne in the form of Unai Emery, who is single handedly rowing a boat towards the top - even though it's apparently going to take a long time to get there.House Martell - Wolves Ian MacNicol/GettyImages With a squad full of Portuguese players boasting a more olive complexion than their Premier League counterparts, their appearance bares some resemblance to the Martell family.Their stoic motto reads 'Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken', something Nuno Espirito Santo will be drilling into his players after a bitterly disappointing FA Cup semi final exit.House Greyjoy - Chelsea BEN STANSALL/GettyImages One of the greatest houses on Westeros, their close attachment to the sea and staying true to their traditions fits the bill for Chelsea - their attachment to the sea involves shipping players off abroad.House Clegane - West Ham Catherine Ivill/GettyImages Boasting a new-ish ground as well as a cult (with an 'L') following, they've often been the masters of their own downfall.They would love to stick it to one of their brothers in the capital, but can't think of a long-term strategy to do so.House Arryn - Brighton Brighton's seagull mascot is a somewhat more irritating and chip-nabbing mascot compared to House Arryn's white falcon, but, you know, it's a white bird at least.The Arryn family has always been the neutral party in Westeros, and well respected among the various families.And to be fair, Brighton are a nice club, sometimes popping their heads up, never causing trouble.House Tarley - Bournemouth Dan Istitene/GettyImages When a certain Samwell Tarley graced our screens, be honest, you thought he was destined for the chop soon after.Well, much like Bournemouth, they're both still about.It's unlikely they'll blow you away at any point, but remain as an under-appreciated success story of the Premier League and GOT.The Night's Watch - Newcastle United Michael Regan/GettyImages The Magpies, the most northern club the Premier League, sport black and white much like their wall guarding counterparts in Game of Thrones.The Crows, as they're known, don all black attire, thick and warm (because it's grim up north), constantly covered in snow to give them the Toon Army look.Not to mention, the members' dedication to the cause is strikingly similar to the Newcastle fans' love of their club.The Faceless Men - Fulham Charlie Crowhurst/GettyImages OK, they're also not a house, but hear me out.With three managers already attempting to steer Fulham clear of danger this season, there's always been a leadership issue, leaving them, well, faceless.Perhaps Felix Magath has returned to haunt his side once again, using the slightly friendlier appearance of Claudio Ranieri or the more handsome get up of a Scott Parker to win over the Cottagers' boardroom?The Wildlings - Huddersfield GLYN KIRK/GettyImages Yes I know, clutching at straws and whatnot.Having shown the warrior like fight and real guts to survive the winter and stay in the Premier League last season, their relegation was confirmed, much in the way the Wildlings have been relegated into iced zombies.
James Tomkins Ruled Out for Rest of Season After Picking Up Groin Injury at Newcastle:::::Roy Hodgson has confirmed Crystal Palace defender James Tomkins will miss the rest of the season with the groin problem he picked up during their win at Newcastle.The centre back hobbled off during the 1-0 triumph at St. James' Park, where Luka Milivojevic scored an 81st minute penalty to seal all three points for the visitors.Speaking after the game, former England boss Hodgson revealed Tomkins would have a scan on the injury but admitted the problem didn't look good.LINDSEY PARNABY/GettyImages Now, previewing his side's home clash with Manchester City on Sunday, Hodgson has confirmed he will be without the former West Ham defender for the rest of the season, also stating that Mamadou Sakho will be absent at the weekend.He said, as quoted by Palace's website: "We lost James Tomkins in the game against Newcastle [United], he has been operated on, so he will miss the remainder of the season which is a major blow, coming on top of Mamadou Sakho's injury five or six games ago.RH: We lost James Tomkins at Newcastle who will now miss the rest of the season which is a major blow.We are still without Mamadou Sakho too.Watch it live!Official #CPFC app https://t.co/TTogt6KZzQ pic.twitter.com/gUCjEHZLwk Crystal Palace F.C.(@CPFC) April 12, 2019 The news is a blow for Palace, who have look improved defensively with Tomkins at the back.Dann and Kelly are now expected to feature in Tomkins and Sakho's absence, with Dann only featuring in six Premier League games this season due to his own injury issues.Three wins in their last six games have helped Palace move clear of the drop zone, with the Croydon outfit now 11 points ahead of Cardiff, who occupy the third relegation spot."Those two have been such important pillars in the centre of our defence and helped us get where we are.It is a big ask for Scott Dann and Martin Kelly, they're going to have to step into some quite big shoes but I am confident that they can do that, and they will get their first chance on Sunday."Ian MacNicol/GettyImages After Sunday's clash with City, Palace face Arsenal at the Emirates before rounding off the campaign with games against Everton, Cardiff and Bournemouth.
Manchester City Director Scouts Frankfurt Star Luka Jovic Ahead of Possible Summer Bid:::::Manchester City director of football Txiki Begiristain flew to Benfica on Thursday to watch Eintracht Frankfurt wonderkid Luka Jovic in action against his parent club in their Europa League quarter-final.The 21-year-old has emerged as one of Europe's most in-form marksmen this season, and his tally of 25 goals in 39 games is said to have attracted interest from many of Europe's elite sides, with Barcelona and Chelsea thought to be especially keen.Luka #Jovic has scored against every team he has faced in Europe this season Marseille Lazio Apollon Limassol Shakhtar Donetsk Inter Milan Benfica pic.twitter.com/lCmDlBfD9J Bundesliga English (@Bundesliga_EN) April 11, 2019 City now appear to have joined the race for his signature, as The Sun claim Begiristain went to watch the game specifically to learn more about Jovic.He will likely have been impressed with what he saw, as Jovic showed his composure to score his side's opening goal shortly before half time.Frankfurt went on to lose the game 4-2, but Jovic certainly impressed, just as he has done throughout the second year of his two-year loan deal with the Bundesliga side.It is widely expected that Frankfurt will activate their option to sign him permanently this summer, before quickly selling him on for a sizeable profit.Alongside Barcelona and Chelsea, Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich are said to be interested, and you can now add City to that list of potential suitors.The Citizens are happy with their strike force of Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus, and are not specifically on the lookout for a new forward.However, they want to know the calibre of players who could be available, and they could opt to pursue a deal for Jovic if they find themselves looking for attacking reinforcements.Stu Forster/GettyImages City remain loyal to Aguero, but they are aware that the 30-year-old doesn't boast the most reliable track record when it comes to injury.The Argentine has missed several matches in recent years as a result of various minor injuries, including a groin injury which sidelined him for six games this season, and City are keen to identify potential replacements for him just in case they need to find a new option.

LeBron Inc. book excerpt: The making of a billion dollar athlete:::::The following is excerpted from LEBRON, INC.: The Making of a Billion-Dollar Athlete by Brian Windhorst.Copyright 2019.Available from Grand Central Publishing, an imprint of Hachette Book Group, Inc.In 2014, LeBron decided to leave Miami and return to Cleveland and the Cavs.This was obviously a massive moment both in LeBrons career and NBA history.A lot went into it and a lot came out of it, so much so that I wrote a different book on the topic called Return of the King, available at fine retailers, should you want to know more about it.When he made the announcement, the differences from what happened in 2010 were both stark and sublime.Instead of a live TV show, LeBron let the world know his choice via letter on Sports Illustrateds website that was co-written by LeBron and gifted feature writer Lee Jenkins.This was the brainchild of Mendelsohn, who believed it was a better way to control the message and prevent it from being reduced to sound bites like Im taking my talents to South Beach.In all honesty, the basic idea wasnt that different from The Decision.Instead of getting a TV network to hand over the reins, a major magazine and website allowed LeBron to take control.ESPN had been vilified for its role in allowing LeBron to do so in 2010; in 2014 Sports Illustrated was lauded.The difference was in the delivery.LeBron James announces his return to Cleveland Cavaliers First off, the news came right out front, not ten minutes in.The headline read im coming home.What followed was a flowing, personal, and nuanced explanation of LeBrons choice to go back to Cleveland, buffeted with promises to take it slow and steady.There was no promise of seven championships, as LeBron had done in a flippant but later painful moment in the televised rally when he signed with Miami.With the help of a strong writer and the polish that rounds of editing allow, the end result was more pleasing in every way.It didnt hurt that the story prodigal son goes home to try to make goodwas simply more attractive to the average fan than the last one: mercenary goes to form unbeatable team.It also must be said that LeBrons rsum was quite different; hed won two championships, and it provided him a certain amount of capital that his 2010 move just didnt have.In 2010, the group said it hit them how badly The Decision had gone when they made the flight down to Miami from Connecticut late that night.The videos of the burning jerseys were out there, and the backlash on social media had started.By the time Heat president Pat Riley and coach Erik Spoelstra met them at the private jet terminal in Miami, LeBron and his associates were a little melancholy.Spoelstra had brought cookies to celebrate; they were looking for hard liquor.LeBron, Inc.: The Making of a Billion-Dollar Athlete by Brian Windhorst LeBron James has proven himself one of the greatest basketball players of all time, but how did he make the transformation from hoops star to sports and business mogul?James's journey down the path to becoming a billionaire sports icon has taught him lessons along the way.BUY NOW In 2014, they realized just how well it was going over on the flight after the letter came out.LeBron had made the announcement from Miami and signed the contract with the Cavs that evening before he took an overnight flight to Rio de Janeiro, where he was doing some Nike business around the World Cup Final.As the Nike Gulfstream jet headed south over the Caribbean and the high-end red wine was cracked open, the group started talking about the reaction and what it could teach them.Like with The Decision, it was really about athlete empowerment.LeBron had something he wanted to say, and by going directly to the fans he was able to create a connection that, this time at least, had paid off.Was this something that could be replicated?Lynn Merritt was on the flight.So was Mendelsohn.With Mendelsohns background in politics, creating a message and getting it out was a daily part of his job.LeBrons letter in some way was like a political speech, an announcement followed by a platform.Mendelsohn, who was a partner in a public relations firm, was also keenly aware of the trends in media and the direction things were going.The use of digital media was growing rapidly, moving away from traditional outlets, especially for younger consumers.It was one of the reasons Mendelsohn wanted to use a digital outlet, Sports Illustrateds website, instead of a traditional outlet, like ESPN TV, to make the announcement.One of the lines in the essay read: Im doing this essay because I want an opportunity to explain myself uninterrupted.That was the basis for the concept, to present something without it having to be filtered or chopped up by media or reduced to a character limit by social media.To be uninterrupted.On the flight, the group came up with a plan to create a digital media platform that would allow athletes to do what LeBron had just done: deliver a message uninterrupted that would be easily shared via social media.If they could profit off these stories by selling them to brands or getting them sponsored, all the better.They decided to name it exactly that: Uninterrupted.They werent alone in having the idea.As Uninterrupted was developed over the coming moments, a similar concept was being assembled by Derek Jeter and his representation agency, Excel Sports Management.Less than a week after Jeter retired from the Yankees in the fall of 2014 after a brilliant career, he announced the formation of a website called the Players Tribune, which would be a place for athletes to publish personal essays just as LeBron had done with Sports Illustrated.Excel had a number of the worlds best athletes under its umbrella, a ready-made list of contributors.Within eighteen months the idea was backed by some athletes and investors as it raised $18 million in funding, including an investment from Kobe Bryant.Uninterrupted had a huge name in his prime, LeBron, and they had the vision of Carter and Mendelsohn to help foster ideas.But they also had a very valuable connector: yet again, Wachter.In addition to all his other connections and roles, Wachter had been on the Time Warner board of directors since 2010.One of the largest media companies in the world, it controlled a number of influential media brands including Warner Bros., Turner Sports, HBO, and Bleacher Report.As LeBrons SpringHill and Uninterrupted ventures grew, it would largely be through strong connections and investments from these Time Warner entities stemming from relationships that were developed with guidance from Wachter.Carter recruited and signed a number of high-profile athletes and gave them ownership shares in the new platform, and they contributed video testimonials.Some of the initial partners were Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots, Draymond Green of the Golden State Warriors, and UFC fighter Ronda Rousey.The videos showed up on Bleacher Report through a deal negotiated with Turner Sports.The first ambitious project was a documentary series with LeBron and Green as they led up to playing against each other in the 2015 Finals.As all of this was unfolding, there was the third pole in this operation, which was LeBrons acting work.Hed done some commercials and small work where hed been the voice of characters.Plus there was that Saturday Night Live gig, but that was years in the past.The first major, legitimate role came in the comedy Trainwreck, which filmed in the summer of 2014.Comedian Amy Schumer wrote LeBron into the script mostly because he was the most famous basketball player she knew, not because she thought hed actually take the role.But when actor Bill Hader was cast as the lead, the possibilities opened up because Hader had worked with LeBron at SNL.Hader and Judd Apatow, the director, showed LeBron the script and took him to lunch.LeBron and Carter didnt love it at first.The script called for LeBron to have a relationship with Haders character, a doctor, because of a knee surgery.Carter didnt want LeBron to be portrayed as an injured athlete in the movie; hed never had knee surgery.Apatow and Schumer changed the script and made LeBron a best friend character to Hader.Amare Stoudemire, who did have a history of knee injuries, had no issues playing the injured athlete.LeBron had no history as a bankable movie star.Having him in a supporting role in the movie wasnt a guarantee of selling tickets.Apatow could have just moved on to another basketball player willing to have scenes in a hospital gown.Carter and LeBron knew there was a power in saying no at first.Apatow, Schumer, and Hader were so motivated to work with LeBron, though, that they were willing to change numerous scenes to make it work.And Schumer and Hader set him up with some winning lines in the script.With that, LeBron was sold on the project, and he came to New York for a week of filming in the summer of 2014, shortly after he signed with the Cavs.They set up the shooting schedule so LeBron could film his scenes last.Again, it helps to be a very famous basketball player.And, apparently, to be selective and demanding in projects can pay off.Somewhere along the line, LeBron and Carter had learned these lessons.It didnt always work, but it often did.When the movie came out in 2015, LeBron won critical and audience acclaim for the role.Apatow and Schumer had given him just the right amount of exposure in the film.There were some layup jokes without sounding corny or going overboard.In short, it was pitch perfect and the exact way to be introduced into movie acting, not too big or too small.It opened up a world of opportunities down the line.He was hardly the first major athlete to get into acting.From Jim Brown to Wilt Chamberlain to Shaquille ONeal, many had come before him.But none of them had visions of doing it as part of the studio.Thanks to Wachter and Carter, thats where LeBron was going to try to be different.

90min's Definitive European Power Rankings: Week 28:::::Following a week in which: - Pep Guardiola lost his side a Champions League game.- Evan N'Dicka lost his side a Europa League game.- Son Heung-min won his side a Champions League game.- Aaron Ramsey won his side a Europa League game.90min, using quotes from the incredible filmography of Rob Reiner, rank the top 15 football teams in Europe: 15) Eintracht Frankfurt (Down 3) "You can't really dust for vomit."(This Is Spinal Tap) They tried.Oh Lord, did they try.Despite their best efforts however, the frightening combination of the brilliance of Joao Felix and the idiocy of Evan N'Dicka has put Eintracht Frankfurt on the brink of an all too early Europa League exit.Unlucky lads.14) Chelsea (Re-Entry) "It's a bit of a departure from what you normally play."(This Is Spinal Tap) Eden Hazard?No.Gonzalo Higuain?No.Olivier Giroud?No.Willian?No, of course not, he's terrible.It was Marcos Alonso - of all people - who popped up with a late winner for Chelsea against Slavia Prague in the Europa League on Thursday night.13) Real Madrid (-) "You're the worst kind; you're high maintenance but you think you're low maintenance."(When Harry Met Sally) So Real Madrid won at the weekend.They beat Eibar 2-1.I'm guessing no one cares...so I'll move on.12) Watford (Re-Entry) "Another day, another dollar, captain."(A Few Good Men) What.A.Comeback.What.A.Performance.What.A. Brace.From.Gerard.Deulofeu.What.A.Bang.Average.Penalty.That.Should've.Been.Saved.But.Wasn't.What.A.Win.11) Benfica (Re-Entry) "It's like God gave you something, man, all those stories you can make up.And he said, 'This is what we got for ya, kid.Try not to lose it.'Kids lose everything unless there's someone there to look out for them."(Stand By Me) There are four 19/20-year-old footballers that can be classified as potentially generational talents; one of them scored a hat trick in the Europa League on Thursday night.Joao Felix is the real deal, God gave him something, man.10) Paris Saint-Germain (Down 1) "Let's talk about your reviews a little bit.Regarding Intravenous Di Milo: 'This tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within.The musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted.They are treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry.'"'That's...that's just nitpicking, isn't it?'"(This Is Spinal Tap) Ok, so we've all seen THAT Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting miss - aka THE WORST MISS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.But when you saw it you probably thought: "Yeah, terrible miss, but Paris Saint-Germain probably won the game 15-0."Well, they didn't.THAT miss actually proved costly, as PSG were held to a 2-2 draw by Strasbourg.9) Arsenal (Down 2) "It happens sometimes.Friends come in and out of our lives, like busboys in a restaurant."(Stand By Me) Arsenal's impressive 2-0 win over SSC Napoli was a bittersweet one, because such a win would not have been possible without the influence of Aaron Ramsey...a player set to leave the club this summer.It's explicitly clear that Aaron Ramsey is the Gunners' best player.It's also explicitly clear that the Gunners will find it very, very, very, hard to replace him.8) Borussia Dortmund (Down 6) "You can't handle the truth!"(A Few Good Men) For a number of weeks Borussia Dortmund had been lauded for winning closely contested games 'like champions', scoring late goals and mounting astonishing comebacks.Well, it turns out that BVB weren't winning games 'like champions', they were merely scraping by.And last Saturday at the Allianz Arena, Lucien Favre's men were found out by a rampant Bayern Munich.The truth hurts.7) Bayern Munich (Up 3) "'The numbers all go to 11.Look, right across the board, 11, 11, 11 and...' "'Oh, I see.And most amps go up to ten?'"'Exactly.'"'Does that mean it's louder?Is it any louder?'"'Well, it's one louder, isn't it?It's not ten.You see, most blokes, you know, will be playing at ten.You're on ten here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, you're on ten on your guitar.Where can you go from there?Where?"'I don't know.'"'Nowhere.Exactly.What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do?"'Put it up to 11.'"'11.Exactly.One louder."'(This Is Spinal Tap) Last Saturday, Bayern Munich turned it up to 11.With the pressure on following a seemingly disastrous draw with Freiburg, FC Hollywood put on a blockbuster performance at the Allianz Arena, thumping BVB 5-0 and proving that they're still the Bundesliga's top dogs.6) Tottenham Hotspur (Up 5) "I love that you get cold when it's 71 degrees out.I love that it takes you an hour and a half to order a sandwich.I love that you get a little crinkle above your nose when you're looking at me like I'm nuts.I love that after I spend the day with you, I can still smell your perfume on my clothes.And I love that you are the last person I want to talk to before I go to sleep at night.And it's not because I'm lonely, and it's not because it's New Year's Eve.I came here tonight because when you realise you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible."(When Harry Met Sally) Tuesday night was a perfect exemplification of why Tottenham Hotspur fans are head-over-heels in love with Mauricio Pochettino.Written off as no hopers against the ALL MIGHTY Manchester City, Pochettino's tactical masterclass inspired Spurs to a famous 1-0 win at the 'New White Hart Lane'.While the UEFA Champions League ties isn't over - far from it in fact - Pochettino has given Spurs the opportunity to do something they've never done before: reach the competition's semi finals.In Poch we trust.5) Manchester City (Down 4) "Jesus H. bald-headed Christ!"(Stand By Me) He did again.Pep Guardiola did it again.Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola decided to field a weakened team in his side's biggest game of the season so far; and, of course, he paid for it.As mentioned previously, the tie is by no means over, but Tuesday night was yet another instance in which Pep Guardiola - in the Champions League at least - made life incredibly hard for himself...for no reason.4) Juventus (Up 1) "Son, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns."(A Few Good Men) Wednesday night, without their best defender Giorgio Chiellini, Juventus put on a Catenaccio masterclass.Penned in their defensive third for the majority of the game at the Johan Cruyff Arena, La Vecchia Signora miraculously kept Ajax at bay (for the most part) and even scored what could be a crucial away goal.Shoutout to Daniele Rugani, in particular, for his fantastic performance (yes, this sentence was an excuse to plug another article).3) Liverpool (-) "You can do anything you want, man."(Stand By Me) On the brink of yet another UEFA Champions League semi final following their 2-0 win over Porto.On the brink of their first league title in nearly 30 years following their 3-1 win over Southampton.Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool are on the brink of history.2) Barcelona (-) "We're very lucky in the band in that we have two visionaries, David and Nigel, they're like poets, like Shelley and Byron.They're two distinct types of visionaries, it's like fire and ice, basically."(This Is Spinal Tap) Lionel Messi: Appearances - 42 Goals - 43 Assists - 15 Luis Suarez: Appearances - 43 Goals - 23 Assists - 9 As Manchester United and Atletico Madrid found out the hard way this past week, when Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez are on top form, no one can stop them.1) Ajax (Up 5) "This is my age!I'm in the prime of my youth, and I'll only be young once!"(Stand By Me) FINALLY.Manchester City have FINALLY been knocked off their perch atop 90min's Definitive European Power rankings.Despite drawing their Champions League quarter final first leg meeting with Juventus, Ajax top the Definitive European Power Rankings this week for one simple reason: they were a joy to watch on Wednesday night.Total Football is back.

Masters round 2 live blog: Updates, highlights from Augusta National:::::AUGUSTA, Ga. Stop me if you've heard this before: Brooks Koepka is the leader at a major championship.The winner of last year's U.S. Open and PGA Championship put himself in great position to chase a third major in four tries, as he shared the overnight lead with Bryson DeChambeau after a six-under 66.But he wasn't the only big name to play well.Phil Mickelson was one back after a 67, Dustin Johnson two back with a 68 and Tiger Woods posted a two-under 70 to put himself square in the mix of things.Rory McIlroy, on the other hand, struggled to a 73 as he once again chases the final leg of the career Grand Slam.Patrick Reed, the defending champion, also only managed a 73.Follow along for live updates and analysis all day from the grounds of Augusta National.If you prefer more bare-bones infor, here's our live leaderboard.10:26 a.m. - What will the cut line be?The top 50 players and ties advance to the weekend at the Masters, and there are currently 54 players at even par or better.That golf course is soft today thanks to the rain, but organizers have responded with some pretty nasty pins.My guess is 1 over ends up being the number.Meanwhile, Ian Poulter began his day with a bogey.Patton Kizzire has continued his solid play, as he's even for the day through 7 and remainds -2.Billy Horschel has birdied each of his first two holes to get to -2, and Frankie Molinari parred the first to say -2.9:58 a.m. - Weather clearing, contenders beginning The rain has stopped here, and it's supposed to stay away at least until the later afternoon, so that's good news for players and patrons alike.Meanwhile, Kevin Kisner and Kiradech Aphibarnrat (both -3) have started their rounds, and Ian Poulter (-4) is on the tee.9:32 a.m. - Bernhard Langer never ages The 61-year-old, who is a two-time Masters champion, just birdied the first hole to get to 2 under for the tournament.Reminder that he entered the final round of the 2016 Masters just two shots off the lead...as a 58-year-old!It's refreshing to see a player who's averaging under 270 yards on the PGA Tour Champions compete with players who fly it 40 yards past him.Also, here's the pin positions for round 2.Here are the hole locations for the second round of #themasters.pic.twitter.com/NTJedx273Q Masters Tournament (@TheMasters) April 12, 2019 8:51 a.m. - Rain, rain, go away Rain was a big storyline earlier in the week, as inclement weather truncated practice rounds on both Monday and Tuesday.Wednesday and Thursday brought sunshine, but the precipitation has returned.It's supposed to subside in just a few hours, but we could see a soft golf course and receptive greens.One would think that would lead to low scores, but the tournament committee here might put pins in difficult positions to prevent someone from taking it too low.There are some interesting groups going out early: Kevin Kisner and Kiradech Aphibarnrat, who both shot -3 on Thursday, are off at 9:47.Ian Poulter (-4) is off at 9:58.A bit later, we'll see Bryson DeChambeau (-6) at 10:42, Phil Mickelson (-5) at 10:53 and Brooks Koepka (-6) at 11:04.Tiger Woods is off at 1:49 p.m. today...weather permitting, of course.
XFL Considering Allowing Multiple Forward Passes Per Play:::::The XFL is considering a rule change that would allow multiple forward passes per play.During an appearance on this week's ProFootball Talk PM podcast, XFL commissioner Oliver Luck said the league is "toying with the idea" of making it legal to throw a forward pass multiple times on a given play as long as the ball does not pass the line of scrimmage.If the XFL adopts the rule, a quarterback would presumably be allowed to throw the ball again if he has the ball batted back to him on the first attempt.Quarterbacks in the NFL can only run with the ball when that happens.The rule would also allow three or more total throws per play, with the final throw taking place behind the line of scrimmage.Luck added that the rule change would make officiating easier on referees, as they would simply have to determine whether the initial throw passed the line of scrimmage.Currently in the NFL, officials must also determine if the ball moved forward or backward on the pass.The XFL is planning for its inaugural season in Feb. 2020.
College football spring games: Ohio State, Alabama, Texas watch guide:::::The busiest Saturday of college footballs spring schedule is upon us.Six of the top 10 teams from last seasons final AP Poll take the field for their spring games this weekend, and many other big-time programs are also scheduled for intra-squad scrimmages.These events, which serve as program showcases for fans and recruits, probably wont tell you which teams will make the College Football Playoff next season, but theyll give you nuggets of information about depth charts, styles of play and how newcomers stand at the conclusion of spring ball.With games televised throughout the weekend, here are the names and stories to watch.OKLAHOMA (Friday, 8:30 P.M.ET, FOX SPORTS OKLAHOMA) Kyler Murray is out at quarterback, and Jalen Hurts is in.After delivering a heroic relief performance in the SEC title game against Georgia last season, Hurts left Alabama to join the Sooners as a grad transfer.Hurts, along with talented pass catchers CeeDee Lamb and Grant Calcaterra (who is out for the spring game), provides security for an offense that loses four starters on the offensive line.The key question for head coach Lincoln Riley will be whether his defense, under new coordinator Alex Grinch, can improve upon its struggles from last season, when it finished ranked 114th in the country in yards allowed.Edge rusher Ronnie Perkins is a candidate to break out after recording five sacks as a true freshman last season.OHIO STATE (NOON ET, BIG TEN NETWORK) There will be plenty of eyes on the sidelines in Columbus, after Urban Meyers retirement led to the promotion of offensive coordinator Ryan Day, a Chip Kelly disciple who served as interim head coach during Meyers three-game suspension last season.Quarterback Dwayne Haskins is also gone, but the Buckeyes have another highly-touted signal-caller ready to replace him: Georgia transfer Justin Fields, who avoided sitting out a year after obtaining an NCAA waiver.Ohio State loses three of its top four receivers from last season, but star running back J.K. Dobbins is back, and there are still a bunch of talented pass catchers on the rosterK.J.Hill, Binjimen Victor and Chris Olave should be Fieldss top weapons on the outside.Although the offense will garner most of the headlines, there are more question marks on defense, where the Buckeyes brought in co-coordinators Greg Mattison (a former Michigan defensive line coach) and Jeff Hafley (a former 49ers defensive backs coach) to replace DC Greg Schiano and co-DC Alex Grinch.NOTRE DAME (12:30 P.M.ET, NBC SPORTS NETWORK) The Fighting Irish ran through the 2018 regular season undefeated, but a 303 beatdown at the hands of eventual national champion Clemson left head coach Brian Kelly and his charges with a bitter taste in their mouths heading into the offseason.Starting quarterback Ian Book returns after a breakout 2018 campaign, but top rusher Dexter Williams and No.1 wideout Miles Boykin are both gone.Chris Finke and Chase Claypool, who combined for 99 catches and 1,210 yards last season, are the most accomplished options back at receiver, and Jafar Armstrong and Tony Jones Jr. bring solid experience to the table at running back.Pass rushers Julian Okwara and Khalid Kareem terrorized opposing offensive lines last season and should be formidable again, which will help offset the loss of tackle Jerry Tillery.Losing linebackers Drue Tranquill and TeVon Coney means the Irish will be inexperienced in the middle of the defense, where senior Asmar Bilal, junior Jordan Genmark Heath and sophomore Paul Moala could move into bigger roles.Having Alohi Gilman, the Navy transfer who emerged as one of the top safeties in the country last year, should also help for an Irish team trying to keep pace with college footballs best.FLORIDA (1 P.M.ET, SEC NETWORK ALTERNATE) The first year of the Dan Mullen era went smoothly for the Gators, who won 10 games and capped the season with a 4115 Peach Bowl win over Michigan.Quarterback Feleipe Franks drastically improved from 2017 to 18, upping his completion percentage and elevating his touchdown-to-interception ratio from 1.1:1 to 4:1.Still, Mullen has said he wants an open QB competition this spring, so redshirt freshman Emory Jones, a dual-threat option who appeared in four games last season, could get a long look during the spring gsme, even though Franks remains the favorite to land the job.The Gators return their top six pass catchers from last season, but Jawaan Taylor is a big loss at right tackle, and Texas transfer Jean Delance and Noah Banks will compete for reps to replace him.The loss of Jachai Polite, who notched 11 sacks last season, leaves a glaring void at defensive end, and one of the top candidates to replace him, Jeremiah Moon, has missed the whole spring with a broken foot.Louisville transfer Jonathan Greenard had seven sacks for the Cardinals in 2017 and is a name to watch on the edge.WISCONSIN (1 P.M.ET, BTN2Go) After a two-year reign atop the Big Ten West, Wisconsin dropped off in 2018, failing to win double-digit games for the first time since 13.Theres a fair bit of turnover for an offense thats usually stable, particularly with four starters on an excellent offensive line gone from a season ago.Alex Hornibrook, the Badgers starting quarterback for the past three years, transferred to Florida State this offseason, but junior Jack Coan started four games last season and true freshman Graham Mertz is the highest-rated high school quarterback to ever choose Wisconsin.Most importantly for the Badgers, running back Jonathan Taylor, who finished last season as the ninth-leading vote-getter for the Heisman Trophy, is back after rushing for 4,171 yards in his first two years in Madison.ALABAMA (2 P.M.ET, ESPN2) After Clemson stunned the Crimson Tide with a 4416 trouncing in the national championship game, a school-record seven Alabama underclassmen declared for the NFL draft and a slew of assistant coaches left Tuscaloosa.Despite the turnover, Nick Saban is still in charge, Heisman finalist Tua Tagovailoa returns at quarterback and the Tide bring back an electrifying quartet of wide receivers in Jerry Jeudy, Henry Ruggs III, DeVonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle that should make them SEC and national front-runners again.Running backs Damien Harris and Josh Jacobs are off to the NFL, but Najee Harris is back after rushing for 783 yards and averaging more yards per carry than both Harris and Jacobs in 2018.The departure of Mike Locksley (now the head coach at Maryland) has put all eyes on former Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian (who has been at Alabama before), who may not change the offense dramatically in his second stint as OC but will still have his spring game performance scrutinized.The Alabama defense lost a host of playmakersQuinnen Williams, Mack Wilson and Saivion Smith, to name a fewbut theres still a lot of talent back, too.Raekwon Davis should anchor the interior of the defensive line, and linebackers Dylan Moses and Anfernee Jennings are back to patrol the middle of the field.MICHIGAN STATE (2 P.M.ET, BTN2Go) After winning 10 games in 2017, the Spartans offense nosedived last season en route to a 76 finish.Notably, quarterback Brian Lewerke saw a significant dip in his play while battling a shoulder injury.He went from throwing 20 touchdowns and seven interceptions in 2017 to throwing just eight touchdowns to 11 picks last season.In an attempt to get more out of his offense, head coach Mark Dantonio promoted quarterbacks coach Brad Salem to offensive coordinator and moved former co-coordinators Jim Bollman and Dave Warner to jobs as position coaches.Running back Connor Heyward handled most of the backfield touches with LJ Scott injured a year ago, so he figures to slot in at running back, and there are some receivers back, but the offense must improve in all phases for Michigan State to contend in the Big Ten East this season.Defensive lineman Kenny Willekes and linebacker Joe Bachie are the headline returners for a defense that had the best rushing defense in the country by a mile last season, but with Willekes out for the spring with a broken leg, the Spartans depth will get extra run.MISSISSIPPI STATE (2 P.M.ET, ESPNU) Entering its second year under head coach Joe Moorhead, Mississippi State will have to replace a number of key contributors from last season.All-SEC first-teamers Montez Sweat and Jeffery Simmons are gone from the defensive line, and quarterback Nick Fitzgerald has exhausted his eligibility after starting at quarterback for three seasons.Junior Keytaon Thompson started the opener last season while Fitzgerald was suspended and appeared in six games, but redshirt freshman Jalen Mayden and early enrollee Garrett Shrader will compete for the starting job, too.The Bulldogs bring some pieces back from a defense that finished No.1 in the country in points allowed per game in 2018, including cornerback Cameron Dantzler and linebacker Erroll Thompson.The Bulldogs 2019 success will likely hinge on whether Moorhead, who directed Penn States attacks led by Saquon Barkley and Trace McSorley, can get more out of his offense.NEBRASKA (2 P.M.ET, BIG TEN NETWORK) Scott Frosts first season in charge of the Cornhuskers got off to a nightmare start as Nebraska dropped its first six games, including a home loss to Troy.The ship steadied eventually, though, and Nebraska won four of its final six with dynamic true freshman quarterback Adrian Martinez emerging as a difference-maker as a dual-threat QB.Martinez threw for 2,600 yards and rushed for 629 in 2018, and some spring game highlight-reel plays will only further his status as a potential Heisman candidate by the time next season rolls around.Grad transfer Darrion Daniels is a player to watch along the defensive line.TEXAS A&M (2 P.M.ET, SEC NETWORK) The Aggies won nine games in Jimbo Fishers first season as head coach and came into the spring with a ton of momentum on the recruiting trail.Quarterback Kellen Mond and nearly his entire receiving corps are back in College Station, but running back Trayveon Williams is headed to the NFL after rushing for 1,760 yards last season.Keep an eye on Jashaun Corbin, a sophomore tailback who averaged 5.7 yards per carry on 61 attempts last season, to take most of Williamss carries.The Aggies also lose one of the best tight ends in the country in Jace Sternberger, which could give early enrollee Baylor Cupp an opportunity to get on the field.The defense loses its top two linebackers, which could give early enrollees Andre White Jr. and RJ Orebo a chance to figure in alongside incumbent starter Buddy Johnson there.PENN STATE (3 P.M.ET, BTN2Go) It feels like a new era in Happy Valley for head coach James Franklin, who loses a great deal of production from last seasons iteration of the Nittany Lions.In particular, the graduation of quarterback Trace McSorley leaves a major void.McSorley had the ball in his hands more than almost any other player in college football and was the winningest signal-caller in Penn State history, so hell be difficult to replace.His backup last season, senior Tommy Stevens, is thought to be the next in line at quarterback, although redshirt sophomore Sean Clifford and redshirt freshman Will Levis have the chance to make things interesting if they turn heads on Saturday and close the gap any further this summer.Sophomore Ricky Slade, who had 257 rushing yards last season, and freshmen Noah Cain and Devyn Ford are the prime candidates to replace NFL-bound running back Miles Sanders.Early enrollee Brandon Smith is a name to watch at linebacker, and Yetur Gross-Matos and Robert Windsor are back on the defensive line after combining for 15.5 sacks last season.AUBURN (4 P.M.ET, SEC NETWORK) The Tigers were up-and-down last season, going 85 overall but 35 in the SEC.Head coach Gus Malzahn needs to pick a replacement for quarterback Jarrett Stidham, and he may turn to five-star recruit Bo Nix to run the offense in 2019 as a true freshman.Junior Malik Willis and redshirt freshmen Joey Gatewood and Cord Sandberg are also possibilities, and A-Day provides a golden opportunity to give all four a trial.One other name to watch offensively: running back JaTarvious Whitlow, who flashed star potential as a redshirt freshman last season.Star defensive lineman Derrick Brown also surprised many by opting to return to school, which gives Auburn a top-tier defensive line that gets its first public opportunity to flex its muscles on Saturday.STANFORD (4 P.M.ET, PAC-12 NETWORK) The Cardinal won nine games last season under head coach David Shaw, and they have some key pieces coming back to boost their Pac-12 title ambitions, including K.J.Costello, who returns at quarterback after a successful 2018 season without the usual services of injury-riddled running back Bryce Love.Offensively, it could be tough to take much from the spring game because there are a host of injuries on the offensive line, but there are key depth chart questions on defense, specifically at linebacker, that Shaw could move closer to an answer on.Curtis Robinson, who has experience as an outside linebacker, will move inside this spring, but linebacker is a question mark nonetheless after the losses of Bobby Okereke and Joey Alfieri.Sophomore Paulson Adebo also returns as one of the best cornerbacks in the country.MICHIGAN (5 P.M.ET, NOT TELEVISED) Jim Harbaugh has won 10 games in three of his first four seasons in Ann Arbor, but his inability to win The Game continues to draw most of the attention surrounding the Wolverines.This year, with Urban Meyer gone and Ohio State coming to the Big House, Harbaugh may have his best chance yet to take down the Buckeyes.This spring, Michigan breaks in new offensive coordinator Josh Gattis, who will be tasked with squeezing every ounce of production out of returning quarterback Shea Patterson.Its reasonable to assume Patterson and the offense will operate at a quicker tempo under Gattis in an effort to generate more explosive plays, but the structure of the offense, and how much more aggressive Harbaugh is willing to be, is still up in the air.Chase Winovich and Rashan Gary are big losses on the defensive line, so players like Josh Uche, Kwity Paye and Michael Dwumfour will likely assume elevated roles for revered coordinator Don Brown.The Wolverines spring game is just a scrimmage at the end of practice, so it wont be as much of a game-like experience as some of the others here.TEXAS (7:30 P.M.ET, LONGHORN NETWORK) Longhorn Nation, were baaaaaaack.These are the words Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger proclaimed after a Sugar Bowl win over Georgia to close last season, and he had a point.In 2018, Ehlinger emerged as one of the best dual-threat quarterbacks in the nation by totaling nearly 3,800 yards and 41 touchdowns as a sophomore.Ehlinger gives head coach Tom Herman a dynamic playmaker to build the offense around, but the Longhorns need more out of their running backs than they got last season.Keaontay Ingram figures to be the feature back after rushing for 708 yards as a freshman.On defense, there are some questions as the Longhorns have to replace eight starters.Caden Sterns is a budding star at safety, and defensive linemen Malcolm Roach and Joseph Ossai are primed for bigger roles after showing promise at the close of last season.If the scrimmage itself doesnt entice you, Ludacris is performing after the game.
Second-half try blitz sees Stormers home in Melbourne:::::MELBOURNE (Reuters) - South Africas Stormers struck early and ran in three tries in a nine-minute burst after the break to end their Australasian tour on a high with an emphatic 41-24 victory over the Melbourne Rebels on Friday.Three successive defeats had made for a miserable trip for the Stormers but a brilliant individual try from pay winger Dillyn Leyds in the third minute gave them early hope of returning to Cape Town with a fourth win of the season.Five tries, including two from winger Ruhan Nel, played a big part but the victory was built on a huge defensive effort from the tourists at the Melbourne Rectangular Stadium.I think the boys were really fired up and they put their bodies on the line tonight, said Steven Kitshoff, standing in as Stormers captain for the rested Siya Kolisi.I think it was an unbelievable effort from forwards and backs.A Jean-Luc du Plessis penalty helped give the Stormers a 10-3 lead at halftime but Rebels fullback Reece Hodge intercepted a pass for a converted try that levelled up the scores straight after the break.The home crowd expected the Rebels much vaunted backline, which had until then been shackled by the Stormers defensive line speed, to cut lose but it was the visitors who scored next.Juarno Augustus had only been on as a replacement back for four minutes when fullback Damian Willemse set him free for the line with a well-timed pass.Five minutes later and hulking Springboks centre Damian de Allende brushed off a series of tackles to cross after some good work from Leyds and when winger Nel benefited from a Quade Cooper spill to add a third, the score was 31-10.The Australian Conference leaders still had 24 minutes to save the game but the Stormers continued to tackle as if their lives depended on it and it was not until the 68th minute that scrumhalf Will Genia got their first points of the second half.A fine run from Marika Koroibete created an opportunity for Campbell Magnay to score another try for the Rebels but it was too late and Nel raced away in the final seconds for his second five-pointer to seal the victory.
FA invested record 128 million pounds back into game in 2017-18 season:::::(Reuters) - The English Football Association generated a total turnover of 376 million pounds during the 2017-18 season and invested a record 128 million pounds back into every level of soccer, the governing body said on Friday.Announcing their financial results for the year ending July 31, 2018, outgoing FA chief executive Martin Glenn said investment from the grassroots upwards, up by 1 million pounds from 2016-17, has been reflected in the progress of England teams.In 2017, Englands junior teams won the under-20 World Cup, the under-17 World Cup and the under-19 European Championship while the senior side reached the World Cup semi-finals in Russia last year.With the FA in strong financial health we are able to give even greater support to our key initiatives, Glenn, who will step down as chief executive at the end of the season, said in a statement on the FA website.Helping to support the England teams to be ready to win and prepared for tournaments has been one of our main priorities.The investment into the technical division and St Georges Park has played a major role in the progress of all of our teams.Last month, the England womens team won the SheBelieves Cup ahead of this years World Cup for which they are viewed as one of the top contenders.Our commitment to womens football has also never been greater.Record investment into the infrastructure has made a real difference and, as a result, its popularity has grown significantly, Glenn added.Broadcasting and sponsorship income was again the largest revenue stream and the FA expects to see the financial benefit of a number of new deals coming into effect from the start of the 2018-19 season.These include a 12-year kit deal with Nike, a three-year FA Cup extension with title sponsor Emirates, a partnership with Budweiser and a record six-year deal for the international broadcast rights for the FA Cup with Pitch and IMG.
Vunipola stands firm after 'liking' controversial Folau comments:::::(Reuters) - England number eight Billy Vunipola on Friday defended himself for liking discriminatory comments made by Australia fullback Israel Folau on social media.FILE PHOTO: Rugby Union - Premiership - Saracens v Harlequins - London Stadium, London, Britain - March 23, 2019 Saracens' Billy Vunipola in action Action Images/Paul Childs/File Photo Folau, a fundamentalist Christian, was informed by Rugby Australia (RA) on Thursday he would be sacked if he could offer no good reason for a social media post that said gay people would go to hell if they did not repent.Vunipola said he had been told by three people to withdraw his apparent support to Folaus post.Hes saying how we live our lives needs to be closer to how God intended them to be.Man was made for woman to pro create that was the goal no?, Vunipola wrote on Instagram.Folaus post has been liked on Instagram by more than 30,000 users, which according to Australian media reports, included some of his Wallabies team mates.Vunipola was born in Australia to Tongan parents but moved to the UK as a child and qualified for England through residency.He and his brother Mako both play for Saracens, Englands leading Premiership club.I dont HATE anyone neither do I think Im perfect, Vunipola added.There just comes a point when you insult what I grew up believing in that you just say enough is enough, what hes saying isnt that he doesnt like or love those people.Folau had posted similar comments last year but escaped sanction and signed a new deal with RA through 2022 in February.That multi-million dollar contract looks certain to be torn up unless Folau can convince RA and the New South Wales Waratahs that there are compelling mitigating factors for sharing the post.Folau has played 73 tests and helped Australia to the final of the 2015 World Cup in England, where they were beaten by New Zealand.
Crusaders come from behind to take South Island honours:::::WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Super Rugby champions the Canterbury Crusaders recovered from a halftime deficit for the second week in a row on Friday to thrash the Otago Highlanders 43-17 and extend their unbeaten run at home to 24 matches.Ten points down after 12 minutes in Christchurch, the Crusaders ran in six tries to secure a bonus point victory and stretch their lead over the resting Wellington Hurricanes at the top of the New Zealand conference to 11 points.Starting outside backs Braydon Ennor, David Havili, Sevu Reece all crossed for the Crusaders before replacements Mitchell Drummond and Will Jordan added two more tries late on, the latter with his eighth of the season.The forwards got into the act when their pressure forced the award of a penalty try from a five-metre scrum in the 52nd minute, one of three tries in 10 minutes after the break that turned the match decisively in their favour.We werent happy with the first 20 minutes, they came out and put us under pressure and it took us a while to adjust to that, said Crusaders captain Sam Whitelock.The best thing is that we did and managed to come out on top of them.A battle against the neighbours is always a tough one and we missed one a few weeks ago so both teams were pretty excited about this.With the opening South Island derby of the season having been cancelled in the wake of the March 15 Christchurch mosque shootings, this was the Highlanders first chance to lay out their stall against the nine-times champions.All Blacks fullback Ben Smith was playing his 150th Super Rugby match and he gave them a flying start when he cut through a gap in the defensive to score in the third minute.Related Coverage Super Rugby week nine Josh Ioane kicked a penalty nine minutes later but the error-prone visitors were unable to get on scoreboard again until the match was already long lost and the young flyhalf crossed for a consolation in the 74th minute.They were pretty clinical in the second half, said Smith.We gave them a few opportunities.Against the Crusasders youve got to take everything youve got.Theyre a pretty class act and setting the standards in Super Rugby.

Mick Schumacher very like his father, says Binotto:::::SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto says be can see similarities between Mick Schumachers approach to his recent Formula One test and how seven times champion father Michael used to go about racing.Formula One F1 - Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai International Circuit, Shanghai, China - April 12, 2019 Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto REUTERS/Thomas Peter Schumacher, 20 and a member of Ferraris driver academy after winning the European F3 title last year, made his test debut with the Italian team in Bahrain this month.The outing came 15 years after Michael won the first grand prix in the Middle East at the same circuit for then-dominant Ferrari.I dont think hes looking very similar to Michael but the way hes behaving is very similar, Binotto, who worked closely with the champion during a golden era at Ferrari that ended in 2006, told reporters at the Chinese Grand Prix on Friday.The way he approaches the exercise and the way hes interested in the car, discussing it with the technicians, he added.So even in Maranello, you are looking after him but hes always in the workshop looking at the car, speaking with the mechanics, and I think thats very similar to his father.Schumacher senior, now 50, has not been seen in public since he suffered severe head injuries in a 2013 skiing accident in the French Alps.Mick was second fastest in the test, albeit on softer and quicker tyres than anyone else, and said he felt at home in the garage.Binotto said it was hard to assess the test because of the poor weather conditions that day and because performance had never been the aim.It was his very first day on an F1 car; more important for him still in the learning phase, day-by-day, is facing a completely new challenge in his F2 season, he said.I think what was certainly positive was the way he approached the exercise, the approach to the day of testing, never pushing to the limit, trying to improve run-by-run, learning the car, learning the team.I think in that respect he did a very good job: very well focussed, concentrated and tried to do the proper job and learn.I think thats the most you may expect on such a day.
Next France coach should be French, referendum decides:::::FILE PHOTO: Bernard Laporte, President of the French Rugby Federation, and French rugby union federation (FFR) vice-president Serge Simon attend a news conference at the Le Coq Sportif factory where the new official jersey of the France rugby team is made in Romilly-sur-Seine, France, October 30, 2018.REUTERS/Benoit Tessier PARIS (Reuters) - Frances next rugby coach should not come from abroad after amateur clubs voted against the idea in a referendum initiated by federation president Bernard Laporte, the FFR said on Friday.The clubs voted 59 per cent against a foreign coach replacing Jacques Brunel, whose contract expires at the end of this years World Cup.France, who have never been trained by a foreign coach and will host the 2023 World Cup, have slipped down to eighth in the World Rugby rankings and face an uphill task to advance from their 2019 World Cup Pool, which features England and Argentina.Since Marc Lievremont took Les Bleus to the 2011 World Cup final, France have failed to live up to their reputation, finishing only once in the top three of the Six Nations.I will respect this choice, Laporte said in a statement.Taking a foreign coach to get France back to the top had been raised as an option with the names of Warren Gatland and Eddie Jones being cited.Laporte will announce the name of Brunels successor before the World Cup starts in Japan on Sept. 20.
Cardiff need 10 more points to avoid the drop, says Warnock:::::(Reuters) - Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock believes the Welsh club need 10 points from their six remaining games to have any chance of preserving their Premier League status.Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City v Cardiff City - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - April 3, 2019 Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock applauds their fans after the match REUTERS/Phil Noble EDITORIAL USE ONLY.No use with unauthorized audio, video, data, fixture lists, club/league logos or "live" services.Online in-match use limited to 75 images, no video emulation.No use in betting, games or single club/league/player publications.Please contact your account representative for further details.Warnocks 18th-placed Cardiff visit Burnley on Saturday before facing Brighton & Hove Albion, who are five points above them, in a relegation six-pointer next Tuesday.They are so important the games now, were running out of time and points, Warnock told a news conference on Friday.Bournemouth, winless in three league games, face their south coast rivals Brighton on Saturday, and Warnock does not expect Eddie Howes side to lend Cardiff a helping hand in the relegation battle.Im not optimistic about Brighton losing any points on Saturday.I dont think Eddie will mind me saying that Bournemouth seem to have hit a bit of a brick wall at the minute, he added.We have to take three points from our next two games.We need 10 points really, to have any chance whatsoever.Warnock said his players are ready to give everything during a daunting season run-in which includes matches against Liverpool and Manchester United.Everyone presumes we wont get anything against Liverpool or Man United (in our later fixtures), I dont see it that way, Warnock said.Ive never seen anything other than a fighting spirit.The dressing room has not been like that this season, even when we have had poor results.Meanwhile, Warnock has been charged by the English Football Association over the comments he made about the match officials following a 2-1 defeat by Chelsea last weekend.The 70-year-old called the officials the worst in the world after Chelsea scored an 84th minute equaliser through Cesar Azpilicueta, who appeared to be in an offside position.Warnock has been charged with three breaches of FA Rule E3 relating to comments made in post-match interviews and a radio interview the following day.He has until Tuesday to respond to the charges.
Racing Point feeling after-effects of Force India struggles:::::SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Canadian-owned Racing Point need time to recover from the effects of last year, when they were Force India and had to be rescued from administration, the Formula One teams technical director Andrew Green said on Friday.Formula One F1 - Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai International Circuit, Shanghai, China - April 12, 2019 Alfa Romeo's Kimi Raikkonen in action during practice REUTERS/Aly Song TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY After two races, the Silverstone-based team are a disappointing ninth overall and ahead only of fallen champions Williams.Were not a long way behind, but I think our weaknesses were probably exposed in the first couple of races, Green told reporters at the Chinese Grand Prix.I think we have to remember that the car was originally conceived in the mid-to-late part of last year, when the team was in serious trouble.We were really struggling at that point.We had to make quite a few decisions about the car and the architecture of the car ... not really knowing what was going to happen with the team, whether there was even going to be a team.We are still getting out of that.Force India, co-owned by troubled Indian magnate Vijay Mallya, went into administration in July and were taken over by a consortium led by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll, starting over as Racing Point.Strolls son Lance, who had raced for Williams, is now one of their drivers.Green had said in February the team were effectively starting a new book, rather than just a new chapter, with far more resources.Force India, despite their financial woes, finished fourth in the championship in 2016 and 2017.Racing Point were seventh last season, an impressive feat considering they started with a clean slate from August.With fresh funding, after Force India laboured under significant debts and had their bank account frozen towards the end, the Silverstone-based team were tipped to be among the leaders in a tight midfield group.Green said the team no longer had to worry about finances under Stroll but it would take time for investment to bear fruit.Racing Point have reached an agreement to use engine supplier Mercedes wind tunnel in Brackley starting later this year and have a plan to return to their target level of performance, he said.Its easy now to say that we have the bills paid at the end of each month, which we never used to be able to say, so its one less thing to worry about, said Green.Were in a much better place now, but improvements take time.

Boxing: Khadem to break a barrier for Iranian women:::::ROYAN, France (Reuters) - Two years after a clandestine impromptu training session on the hills of Tehran, Sadaf Khadem will become the first Iranian woman to contest an official boxing fight, hoping to lead the way in the Islamic Republic.Iranian boxer Sadaf Khadem poses before a training session in preparation to her first official boxing bout in Royan, France, April 11, 2019.REUTERS/Regis Duvignau The bout will take place in western France on Saturday after the 24-year-old met with Frenchman Mahyar Monshipour, an Iranian-born former super bantamweight world champion.In 2017, I went to Iran for a promotional event and I ended up organizing a public training session on the hills overlooking Tehran.About 35 people showed up, and there were six women, Monshipour told Reuters.She contacted me on social media to ask me to make her box but I told her it was not possible.Then about a couple of months ago the Iranian federation opened the door for women boxing and we asked them to set up an event.But it became apparent that it would not be possible because they wanted a female coach, female referee... so with the help of the Sports ministry we made her come to France.Next week Khadem will return to Iran, where Monshipour expects her to be met with popular jubilation.He will, however, travel back with her, just in case, to a country where women have started to take off their head scarves in a peaceful protest against the compulsory hijab.If she ends up in custody, I will not let her down, he said.Khadem took up boxing four years ago, being compelled to train in private fitness rooms since public boxing facilities are reserved for men.In Iran, women were allowed to attend a mens soccer game for the first last October.It is easier for wrestling and weightlifting because they are more in our culture, Khadem told Reuters after a training session on Thursday.BREAK THE DAM Some women fight but the bouts are illegal and being held in Turkey with no medical insurance.In France, Khadem trained at the National Institute of Sport and was handed a French license to practice and fight.For the first time she trained among men, and she burst into tears at the end of a session, overwhelmed by her emotions.My parents were worried when I started boxing but they saw I was really loving it so now they are supporting me.Im now steaming ahead, said Khadem.I have been waiting for this moment for so long.I hope this first fight will pave the way and that I will go as far as I can to have my name in the history of Iranian boxing.But Khadem, who weighed around 100 kilograms when she started boxing compared to 68 now, is on a mission.I hope to break the dam.I dont matter.What matters is Mahyar, who made this fight possible.It could have been anyone instead of me, she explained.In my country, there are a lot of women who box, this fight is also for them.Slideshow (12 Images) Khadem, however, took her chance, adding hours to her fitness coach job to get ready for a 3x2 amateur bout where she will sport Irans colors.Downplaying her achievement, she said: Everyone has difficult moments in their lives.In every country it is difficult to do some things.You have to overcome the hurdles.Her opponent, local boxer Anne Chauvin, said she was happy to be part of this fight to help the cause of women.
Southampton part company with chairman Krueger:::::(Reuters) - Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger has left the club by mutual consent after five years in the role, the Premier League side said on Friday.FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Southampton vs Manchester United - St Mary's Stadium, Southampton, Britain - September 23, 2017 Southampton chairman Ralph Krueger with co-owners Gao Jisheng and Katharina Liebherr Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien The former German ice hockey internationals contract was set to end in June and following recent talks with Southampton shareholders Jisheng Gao and Katharina Liebherr, it was agreed by all parties that the deal would not be renewed.Ralph represented our club with honour and integrity, and followed the Southampton way with great passion.We thank him for the foundations he has helped to build and wish him well for the future, Chinese businessman Gao said in a statement.Liebherr said Canadian-born Krueger, 59, had laid the foundations for Southampton to be a sustainable team that put pressure on the top sides in the Premier League.He was a true leader who fully embodied the Southampton way, a culture which will live on strongly beyond his time as chairman, Liebherr added.Kruegers departure comes nearly four months after vice-chairman Les Reed left the club to become the English Football Associations new technical director succeeding Dan Ashworth.Everything has a beginning and everything has an end.Its the journey in-between that Ill treasure.Thank you Southampton Football Club for the journey, Krueger said.Former NHL coach Kruegers tenure at the south coast club has not entirely been smooth, as he oversaw the appointment of five different full-time managers with current boss Ralph Hasenhuttl being the latest in December.Southampton also narrowly missed out on silverware in 2017 when they were beaten 3-2 by Manchester United in the League Cup final.They then just managed to avoid relegation last season.Saints, who are 17th in the table with 33 points from 32 games, said they would provide more information about their future leadership structure at the end of the season.
Vettel has priority but that could change, says Ferrari boss:::::SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Sebastian Vettel still has priority at Ferrari in 50-50 situations but that could change, team boss Mattia Binotto said on Friday.Formula One F1 - Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai International Circuit, Shanghai, China - April 12, 2019 Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in action during practice REUTERS/Thomas Peter The four times Formula One world champion has been the Italian teams number one in recent years but new recruit Charles Leclerc was quicker in Bahrain two weeks ago.Leclerc, 21, started on pole position at Sakhir but fell behind before then overtaking the German, setting the fastest race lap and taking his first F1 podium.The Monegasque, who finished third, would have won had his car not suffered a loss of power while leading with some 10 laps to go.Vettel has yet to stand on the podium in two races this season.Binotto told reporters at the Chinese Grand Prix that the team came first.As I said at the start of the season, if there is any 50-50 situation where we need to take a decision, the advantage would have been given to Sebastian simply because Sebastian has got most of the experience with the team in F1, he added.He won four championships (with Red Bull) and certainly for us hes the driver who has most probability to challenge for the title.Something we agreed with both drivers is, in a few races time, things may change for whatever reason bad luck or whatever could be the situation we may change our position, no doubt.Binotto said the pair remained free to fight on track and if either was clearly faster than the other would be given preference.Leclerc, he pointed out, had the opportunity to take pole position and fight for the win in Bahrain.The Monegasque ignored a team order to stay behind Vettel in Bahrain, pointing out that he was quicker.There were no recriminations.Vettel made errors in Bahrain, spinning while trying to defend second place from eventual winner Lewis Hamilton, and said afterwards that he had homework to do.Asked also whether Leclerc was giving Ferrari a headache with his pace, Binotto said that was a luxury that youre happy to have.Weve got two fantastic drivers and I think that Charles is a motivating factor for Seb, he added.Binotto also complimented Leclerc for his reaction to the disappointment of having a first win seized from his grasp by bad luck.He did a great quali, a great race but more than that, I think he has been fantastic on the post-race comments, showing that hes really a mature driver, said the Swiss-born boss.
Hammer says Shields fight will change women's boxing:::::BERLIN (Reuters) - The unifying world middleweight fight between two-time American Olympic champion Claressa Shields and Christina Hammer will change the face of womens boxing, the German said in preparation of the biggest bout of her career.FILE PHOTO: Christina Hammer of Germany (R) punches Diana Kiss of Hungary at the WBF World Championship Middleweight title fight in Ljubljana February 18, 2011.REUTERS/Srdjan Zivulovic/File Photo The 28-year-old Hammer, a multiple world champion over two weight divisions, is undefeated in her ten-year pro career with 24 victories from 24 fights, but knows the bout against Shields is as big as they get.The main event on Saturday night in Atlantic Citys Boardwalk Hall with television coverage and a big crowd, the fight is billed as the biggest in the history of womens boxing and Shields is a worthy opponent.Unbeaten in her eight bouts and with two Olympic golds from London 2012 and the Rio 2016 Games under her belt, the aggressive 24-year-old Shields has three of the four belts and is seen as a slight favourite on home soil.I think the world of womens boxing will change after this, Hammer told Reuters.It is a super fight.This big fight will push womens boxing up.(Broadcaster) Showtime really believes in this fight.We are fighting Saturday evening now.Afterwards fans will be more informed about womens boxing, she said.Publicity aside, Hammer is eager to confirm her world champion credentials in a fight where all four belts WBO, IBF, WBA and WBC will be up for grabs.I feel very good and I am here to win it, she said in a telephone interview from New York.I am in my best shape.It is my time.I have been a world champion for 10 years.I have worked hard and the time has come where you face a great opponent.The soft-spoken Hammer is known for her patience in the ring as she gradually wears her opponents down, as opposed to Shields explosive style.She is a very strong opponent.She knows what she can do in the ring.I have studied her and analysed her.But this is not the Olympics with three rounds.With 24 (professional) fights, time and experience is on my side.I have to keep her at a distance if she comes close.I have to stay cool and not fall for her gimmicks and show my own style.While there is a bigger spotlight on womens boxing, the purses for the bouts between men and women are far from similar, with some mens fights commanding hundreds of millions of dollars compared to tens of thousands of dollars for the big fights in womens boxing.That is still something that needs to be done.Not much has been done on that yet, Hammer said.We as women have to get this.But ultimately it depends on the fans.If the fans watch then you earn more money.
Rugby Australia's 'position unchanged' after Folau meeting:::::SYDNEY (Reuters) - Israel Folau had a meeting with Rugby Australia and the New South Wales Rugby Union to discuss his social media posts on Friday but the governing bodies said they still intended to terminate his contract.Rugby Union - England v Australia - Twickenham Stadium, London, Britain - November 24, 2018 Australia's Israel Folau scores their second try Action Images via Reuters/Paul Childs The 30-year-old fullback, one of Australias few genuinely world class players, was informed on Thursday he would be sacked if he could offer no good reason for a social media post that said gay people would go to hell if they did not repent.RA and NSWRU considered the post to be discriminatory and said the multi-million dollar contract Folau signed in February would be torn up.Folau, a fundamentalist Christian, has maintained a public silence since posting the meme on Instagram late on Wednesday but finally made contact with his employers on Friday.Rugby Australia and the NSW Rugby Union have met with Israel Folau in Sydney today, the bodies said in a statement.As the meeting was held in confidence between the player and his employers, Rugby Australia and the NSW Rugby Union will not comment on the discussions at the meeting.Following todays meeting the two organisations will update their respective Boards on the matter to consider next steps.Our joint position regarding Israel Folau is unchanged.The sacking of Folau would throw the plans of Australia coach Michael Cheika into disarray with only three months to go until the Rugby World Cup.The New South Wales Waratahs have no fixture this week but said in a statement late on Friday that the top try-scorer of all time in Super Rugby had in any case been stood down from all player duties until further notice.Folau escaped sanction when he posted similar comments last year but RA took a much harder line when, having repeatedly warned him against it, the player repeated the offence.The fallout continued on Friday with numerous media columnists opining on what the decision meant for the country and politicians wading in.Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who is a Pentecostal Christian like Folau, said whether to sack him or not was a decision for only the rugby authorities to make.Israels comments were insensitive and its important that when youre in public life, youre just very mindful of being sensitive to other Australians and that you speak with that empathy, he said.Opposition leader Bill Shorten said the bodies had made the correct decision.There is no freedom to perpetuate hateful speech, he told reporters in Sydney.Some of the comments which have been seen are far closer to hateful than I think appropriate for what people should be doing on social media.Former Wallabies coach turned radio host Alan Jones said the decision endangered free speech in Australia and had been driven by RAs concern not to upset sponsors.It has nothing to do with Israel, or rugby, or religion, homosexuals, or whatever.Where are we in this country on free speech?he said.Weve got an issue here because were going down a very, very narrow road here.Folaus chances of switching back to rugby league in Australia were also dashed late on Thursday with the governing body the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) ruling out any return to the sport.Israel Folau doesnt pass our inclusiveness culture, which is a policy strongly supported by the ARLC, its chairman Peter Beattie told The Sydney Morning Herald.And after talking to some commissioners tonight (Thursday), we dont support him playing rugby league again.His best chances therefore lie offshore, although the chances of joining French club Toulon appear to be non-existent with their outspoken owner Mourad Boudjellal criticising him in an interview in French newspaper LEquipe.
Bottas tops Vettel to go fastest in Chinese GP practice:::::SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Championship leader Valtteri Bottas pushed Sebastian Vettel off the top of Fridays timesheets to end the opening day of practice for the Formula One Chinese Grand Prix with the fastest time for Mercedes.Formula One F1 - Chinese Grand Prix - Shanghai International Circuit, Shanghai, China - April 12, 2019 Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas in action during practice REUTERS/Thomas Peter The Finn, who leads team mate Lewis Hamilton by one point in the overall standings and was fifth in the first of Fridays two 90-minute sessions, set a benchmark time of one minute 33.330 seconds in the afternoon.That put him just 0.027 seconds clear of Vettel, who had gone fastest in the morning by a 0.207-second margin ahead of Hamilton.Max Verstappen was third fastest, 0.221 seconds off Bottas best.The Dutchman displayed a decent turn of speed having also gone fourth quickest in the morning.His Honda-powered Red Bull team were winners in China last year, with Tag Heuer-badged Renault engines in the back and Daniel Ricciardo behind the wheel, and have been tipped as strong outside contenders to repeat that feat this weekend.But the 21-year-old struggled with what appeared to be problems shifting gears and clutch issues throughout the session.Hamilton could do no better than fourth having gone second-fastest behind Vettel during the opening 90-minutes.The Briton is the most successful driver by far around the 5.4-kilometer long Shanghai International Circuit.But the reigning five-times world champion can expect a stiff challenge in his bid for an unprecedented sixth triumph with Ferrari tipped as favourites following their Bahrain performance and Red Bull also in with an outside chance.Ferraris Charles Leclerc also had a disappointing session.The Monegasque ended the day with only the seventh-fastest time, slower than the Renault and McLaren cars of Nico Hulkenberg and Carlos Sainz and 0.828 seconds off the ultimate pace.Both the 21-year-old, third in the morning, and Vettel are running a new control electronics package on their power units as a precaution against a repeat of the engine problems that denied Leclerc his maiden win at the Sakhir desert track.But Leclercs session still came to an early end, as he parked up in the garage with some 20 minutes still to go to allow Ferrari to carry out precautionary cooling checks.Lando Norris, fresh from having scored his first Formula One points in Bahrain, was eighth for McLaren ahead of Renaults Daniel Ricciardo.Slideshow (3 Images) Red Bulls Pierre Gasly rounded out the top 10.Fridays two sessions, ahead of what will be the 1000th Formula One world championship race on Sunday, were relatively trouble free apart from a few spins as the drivers explored the limits and got to grips with the track.Hamilton and Bottas both spun during the second 90 minutes while Lance Stroll lost control of his Racing Point at the exit of the final corner in the morning.
Patient Pant can be the 'finisher' India need - Srikkanth:::::NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Rishabh Pant must learn the virtue of patience to transform himself from an exciting match-winner to a crucial finisher for India, according to former captain Krishnamachari Srikkanth.Cricket - India Nets - Edgbaston, Birmingham, Britain - July 31, 2018 India's Rishabh Pant during nets Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers Famed for his swashbuckling batting, Pant is expected to be the second wicketkeeper in Indias World Cup squad, behind Mahendra Singh Dhoni, after impressing across all three formats.Pant smashed a blistering 78 not out of 27 balls in an Indian Premier League match against Mumbai Indians last month but the former aggressive opener advised the Delhi Capitals player to shun risks early in his knock.I firmly believe that he is one cricketer in India who could win his side - be it Delhi Capitals or Indian teams - games from hopeless situations, Srikkanth wrote in a column in Fridays Times of India newspaper.This kid has it in him but from my observation I feel that he doesnt give himself enough time to showcase his talent in the middle.He goes too hard right at the start.He needs to play in the V the first few balls, irrespective of the format, maybe push the ball towards long-on or long-off frequently and get his eyes in.He has great ability and a range of shots to make it up in the end, added Srikkanth, a member of Indias triumphant 1983 World Cup team.Delhi head coach Ricky Ponting also believes Pant needed to be patient to be able to inflict maximum damage on rivals in the final overs.With Rishabh in white-ball cricket, the issue is that hes such a competitor that sometimes that gets the better of him, Ponting said ahead of Fridays match with Kolkata Knight Riders.He wants to get things done quickly in the white-ball game.In the tests he doesnt so much because theres not as much scoring pressure in tests.Ponting, however, would not ask the 21-year-old to change the way he bats.Im not going to curb the way he plays, Im not gonna tell him to slow down because if he plays his best he will win games for us, Ponting said.I want him to go out with pure freedom and with no other thought other than hitting the ball for a six.We saw in Mumbai, when it comes off, were going to win.
'Captain Cool' Dhoni fined for confronting IPL umpires:::::(Reuters) - Mahendra Singh Dhonis uncharacteristic outburst against a controversial umpiring decision led to the Chennai Super Kings captain being fined 50 percent of his match fee in Thursday nights Indian Premier League (IPL) match in Jaipur.Cricket - India v Australia - India Team's Practice Session - Indore, India September 23, 2017 India's Mahendra Singh Dhoni bowls in the nets.REUTERS/Adnan Abidi Hailed as Captain Cool during his trophy-laden years as India skipper, an unusually fired-up Dhoni stepped onto the field to remonstrate with umpire over a contentious no-ball call in a dramatic final over against Rajasthan Royals.MS Dhoni, the Chennai Super Kings captain, was fined 50 percent of his match fees for breaching the Indian Premier Leagues Code of Conduct during his teams match against Rajasthan Royals at Jaipur, the league said in a statement.Confusion reigned in the last over after umpire Ulhas Gandhe signalled Ben Stokes waist-high delivery a no ball but the decision was overruled by square-leg umpire Bruce Oxenford, prompting Dhoni to enter the field and confront the umpires.The no ball was eventually deemed a legal delivery but Chennai, needing four runs off the last ball, managed to win with a last-ball six from Mitchell Santner.MS was after some clarity and it didnt seem to be coming so he took the opportunity to go out and discuss it with the umpires.The rights and wrongs will be discussed by everybody, Chennai head coach Stephen Fleming told reporters.He was certainly fired up about the way the decision was handled and why it was overturned... and he wanted to get it clarified at a key moment.Rajasthans Jos Buttler was not sure if Dhoni did the right thing in approaching the umpires.Obviously tensions are running high in the IPL, every run counts and it was a big moment in the game, the Englishman said.But whether stepping on to the pitch is right, no, probably not.Former England captain Michael Vaughan was more outspoken in his criticism of Dhoni.This is not a good look for the game, Vaughan tweeted.No place at all for a captain to storm onto the pitch from the dugout.The result took league leaders Chennai to 12 points from seven games, extending their lead over second-placed Kolkata Knight Riders to four points.The IPL has continued to garner a larger audience with 345 million viewers in India tuning in over the first two weeks, a 14 percent increase from last year for the same period, broadcasters STAR Network said.
Overlooked Koepka pops up on Green Jacket radar with 66:::::AUGUSTA, Ga. (Reuters) - Despite having won three of the last six majors he contested Brooks Koepka was not on many Green Jacket radar screens when he arrived at Augusta National this year.Brooks Koepka of the U.S. looks at his putt on the 7th green during first round play of the 2019 Masters golf tournament at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S., April 11, 2019.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson He is now.A golfer who prefers to let his play do his talking, Koepka delivered a bogey free six-under 66 that was highlighted by a back nine charge featuring four successive birdies to grab a share of the first round lead alongside Bryson DeChambeau.While DeChambeau, nicknamed the professor, is seen as the brains of the PGA Tour the muscular Koepka is viewed as the brawn having used to spend hours in the weight room.Koepka, however, has recently cut back on his gym time and paid more attention to his diet.His weight loss coincided with an equally noticeable drop in form that saw the 28-year-old slip into a pre-Masters slump, missing the cut at the Arnold Palmer and finishing outside the top 55 at both the Players Championship and WGC Dell Match Play.I lift too many weights and Im too big to play golf and then when I lose weight, Im too small, said Koepka.I dont know what to say.Im too big and Im too small.I dont care what anybody else says.Im doing it for me, and obviously it seems to work.Playing in the last group, Koepka was back to his imposing and intimidating self having what he described as the best ball striking round he has ever had at a major championship.While Koepka has found it difficult to earn the recognition he feels he deserves there is no denying he is a golfer built for the big stage.Of his five PGA Tour wins, three have been at majors.After watching last years Masters from his couch recovering from a wrist injury, Koepka has returned a major monster successfully defending his U.S. Open crown last year and winning the 2018 PGA Championship.I get to whatever major championship it is and just when I arrive there, I just get a good feeling, said Koepka.I dont know how to explain it.Im just dialled in and Im focused the entire week.I keep pretty much the same routine for all the majors.I just enjoy the big stage.I enjoy major championships thats what youre remembered by.

KXIP vs RCB Preview: Virat Kohli's Royal Challengers Bangalore Take On Ravichandran Ashwin-Led Kings XI Punjab In Must-Win Clash:::::Virat Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) have got off to a horrific start in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2019, losing six matches on trot, and will find themselves in a must-win situation when they face Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali.RCB slumped to their sixth straight loss after going down against Delhi Capitals in their IPL match last Sunday.Kohli, who was recently named the Leading Cricketer of the Year for the third successive time by Wisden Almanack, will hope that fortunes finally knock at the doors of RCB as they need to win all their next eight matches to salvage any hope of making it to the play-off.RCB have been inconsistent with both their bowling and batting faltering in many occasions.The RCB bowlers had allowed SunRisers Hyderabad to post a mammoth 232 with centuries from Jonny Bairstow and David Warner before they were skittled out for 113 to lose the match by a massive 118 runs.Against Kolkata Knight Riders, despite AB de Villiers and Kohli scoring 63 and 84 respectively, RCB bowlers failed to defend 205 with KKR riding on Andre Russell's explosive knock of 13-ball 48 to romp home.Yuzvendra Chahal has been their top bowler with nine wickets but rest of the bowling line-up conceded far too many runs.RCB's batting too has looked equally inconsistent.In their first match against Chennai Super Kings, RCB were bowled out for a paltry 70 in 17.1 overs after their top-order crumbled against Harbhajan Singh and Imran Tahir.In their last match against Delhi, barring Kohli's 33-ball 41 and Moeen Ali's 18-ball 32 cameo, RCB's ordinary batting display took the side to a modest 149/8, a target which was easily achieved by DC.KXIP, on the other hand, have won four matches out of seven but they have maintained dominance on home ground.However, Punjab failed to defend 197 against Mumbai Indians in their last match with Kieron Pollard's knock of 31-ball 83 blowing them away.Squads: Royal Challengers Bangalore: Virat Kohli (capt), Parthiv Patel (wk), AB de Villiers, Colin de Grandhomme, Umesh Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Moeen Ali, Shimron Hetmyer, Shivam Dube, Mohammed Siraj, Navdeep Saini, Devdutt Padikkal, Himmat Singh, Milind Kumar, Gurkeerat Singh Mann, Heinrich Klaasen, Pawan Negi, Washington Sundar, Akshdeep Nath, Prayas Barman, Kulwant Khejroliya, Tim Southee.Kings XI Punjab: Ravichandran Ashwin (capt), KL Rahul (wk), Chris Gayle, Mayank Agarwal, Sarfaraz Khan, David Miller, Mandeep Singh, Sam Curran, Andrew Tye, Murugan Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Mujeeb Ur Rehman, Karun Nair, Moises Henriques, Varun Chakravarthi, Harpreet Brar, Simran Singh, Nicholas Pooran, Hardus Viljoen, Ankit Rajpoot, Arshdeep Singh, Darshan Nalkande, Agnivesh Ayachi.Match starts at 8 pm IST (With PTI inputs)
How CSK 'Clark Kent' Trumped Ben Stokes' 'Superman' Moment:::::Chennai Super Kings found the unlikeliest heroes in Mitchell Santner as the New Zealander smacked Ben Stokes for a six off the final ball to give Chennai Super Kings (CSK) a four-wicket win over Rajasthan Royals at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Thursday night.Santner came in as a replacement for Harbhajan Singh, who has been exceptional with the ball for CSK in IPL 2019.The New Zealand spinner took a wicket and gave away just 25 runs off his four overs to help restrict Rajasthan Royals to 151 for seven.The hosts, however, remained in contention with some brilliant fielding, none more spectacular that Ben Stokes' 'Superman' leap which will surely go down as one of the best catches in IPL history.Standing at point, the Englishman came up with a moment of magic in the sixth over of the CSK innings.The fifth ball of Jofra Archer's over was slashed on the off side by Kedar Jadhav, but Stokes leapt to his left to pluck out the fast-travelling ball out of the air.That would have been the highlight of the match and Stokes the hero but Mitchell Santner had other ideas.After a solid spell with the ball, Santner made a more telling contribution with the bat in hand.Santner came into bat MS Dhoni's dismissal.CSK needed 8 runs off the final three balls of Stokes' over.The New Zealand left-hander managed to club the first ball to long-on for a double despite it appearing to be a waist-high no-ball.Dhoni walked onto the field to protest against umpire's decision.The original call stood, meaning CSK needed six off the last two balls.Despite all the drama around him, Santner kept a cool head and knocked the next delivery for another double.Four were needed off the last ball now, but Stokes decided to hand CSK an early Diwali gift by bowling a wide, which left CSK needing 3 off the final ball.Santner clinched the match for CSK by smashing Stokes for a maximum.After his heroics, Matthew Hayden, sitting in the commentary box, referred to Santner as Superman's bespectacled alter ego."There is Superman.He is just gone back to being Clark Kent.Just his disguise.What a wonderful final ball for Santner," said Matthew Hayden in commentary box.CSK top the IPL Points Table with 12 points, four more than second-placed Kolkata Knight Riders.
MI vs RR Preview: Resurgent Mumbai Indians Host A Struggling Rajasthan Royals:::::Mumbai Indians will lock horns with an out-of-sorts Rajasthan Royals in Saturday's first IPL 2019 match at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.Mumbai Indians, having won their last three matches, are third on the table with 8 points.Rajasthan Royals, seventh on the table, are still looking for only their second win of the season.MI stars Kieron Pollard and Alzarri Joseph, who have come up with two match-winning performances in the home team's last two matches, will be the players in focus, while home skipper Rohit Sharma's return from injury will also be awaited.A leg spasm had forced Rohit to miss an IPL game for the first time in 11 seasons when he sat out of Mumbai's last game against Kings XI Punjab.In Rohit's absence, stand-in skipper Kieron Pollard ensured MI continue their good run as his whirlwind 83-run knock helped the side script a three-wicket win in a humdinger on Wednesday.The winning runs were hit by 22-year-old Alzarri Joseph, who has been the new sensation in this year's cash-rich T20 league.After a dream debut where he returned with best IPL figures of six for 12 against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Alzarri (15 not out) played a crucial cameo against Kings XI to romp the side home.Another West Indian who would be in focus is Jofra Archer, who had given Rajasthan Royal a chance to defend 151 against Chennai Super Kings last night with a superb spell of fast bowling.Rohit's injury had given a scare to India ahead of the World Cup but Pollard has made it clear that the skipper missed the last game just as a precautionary measure and he should be back in the next game."Obviously, Rohit is the captain of the team and it was only a precautionary measure for the team.He should be back in the next game," Pollard had said.Rohit's inclusion will not only put to rest any doubts about his fitness but also boost the Mumbai's batting line-up, which also comprises Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya and ever-reliable Surya Kumar Yadav.RR's batting line-up, including skipper Ajinkya Rahane, Sanju Samson, Steve Smith and Jos Buttler will need to pull up their socks to confront the Mumbai bowlers at the Wankhede Stadium.Archer had a decent outing against Chennai Super Kings and his performance would also be key.Rajasthan Royals pacers Jaydev Unadkat and Dhawal Kulkarni along with Shreyas Gopal and leggie Riyan Parag would have to deliver for their skipper if they have to stay alive and make it to the Playoffs.Squads Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma (capt), Quinton de Kock (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Yuvraj Singh, Kieron Pollard, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Jason Behrendorff, Mayank Markande, Rahul Chahar, Jasprit Bumrah, Alzarri Joseph, Anmolpreet Singh, Siddhesh Lad, Ankul Roy, Evin Lewis, Pankaj Jaiswal, Ben Cutting, Ishan Kishan, Aditya Tare, Rasikh Salam, Barinder Sran, Jayant Yadav Rajasthan Royals: Ajinkya Rahane (capt), Steve Smith, Ben Stokes, Jofra Archer, Jos Buttler, Ashton Turner, Ish Sodhi, Oshane Thomas, Liam Livingstone, Sanju Samson (wk), Shubham Ranjane, Stuart Binny, Shreyas Gopal, Sudhesan Midhun, Jaydev Unadkat, Prashant Chopra, Mahipal Lomror, Aryaman Birla, Riyan Parag, Dhawal Kulkarni, Krishnappa Gowtham, Varun Aaron, Shashank Singh, Manan Vohra, Rahul Tripathi Match starts at 4 pm IST (With PTI inputs)
MS Dhoni Hits Ravindra Jadeja On The Head With His Bat After Astonishing Six:::::MS Dhoni starred with the bat as Chennai Super Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by four wickets to open up a four-point gap at the top of the IPL Points Table .The drama-filled IPL 2019 encounter at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur will forever be remembered for MS Dhoni losing his cool and entering the field to protest against an umpiring decision.But another incident captured the imagination of fans around the world -- Ravindra Jadeja's mindboggling six .The CSK all-rounder managed to get a proper connection despite falling over and landing up on the deck.As Jadeja lay on the ground -- probably figuring out how he managed to pull the shot off -- an ecstatic Dhoni walked up to him and did something extremely bizarre.M25: RR vs CSK - Ravindra Jadeja Six https://t.co/fld9wJjl8P Dhiraj (@dhiraj349) April 11, 2019 Fans were left shell-shocked by Ravindra Jadeja's spectacular shot.You don't see such images in cricket very often.Even Dhoni reacted to this ludicrous Jadeja shot off Ben Stokes.Crazy finish to end off the match#RRvCSK #IPL2019 pic.twitter.com/14WGjWL5xy Online Citizen (@unilator) April 12, 2019 This was crazy stuff.Jadeja has invented a new shot today!#Dhoni #CSKvsRR https://t.co/AGGW8zAjhA Tohid Qureshi (@tohidivity) April 11, 2019 The win in Jaipur helped MS Dhoni become the first captain in the history of IPL to win 100 matches.MS Dhoni has won 29 more matches than Gautam Gambhir, who is second on the list.CSK recorded their sixth win in seven games as they made a rough weather of a modest 152 run target before Mitchell Santner's six sealed in a dramatic final over in which CSK needed 18 runs.Dhoni on his part scored 58 off 43 and added 95 with Ambati Rayudu (57 off 47 balls) for the fifth-wicket.CSK top the IPL table with 12 points, having won six out of the seven matches they have played.Kolkata Knight Riders are second with eight points but have played a game less than CSK.Mumbai Indian and Kings XI Punjab also have eight points and occupy third and fourth spot in the table respectively.
MS Dhoni Showdown With Umpires “Probably not Right”, Says Jos Buttler:::::MS Dhoni created a controversy when he, upset with a no-ball decision going against his team Chennai Super Kings during their match with Rajasthan Royals at Jaipur, marched onto the playing field to argue the case with the umpires, a move that has not been taken well by some former and current players.Rajasthan Royals opener Jos Buttler, who was on the field when the incident happened, said that Dhoni was "probably not right" in stepping on to the field to contest the issue.Dhoni lost his cool and rushed into the field of play to confront umpire Ulhas Gandhe after he reversed what initially looked like a no-ball call by him.MS Dhoni was fined 50 per cent of his match fees for the incident."I was fielding at the boundary so I am not sure what had actually happened.I am not sure if that was the right thing to do," Buttler said at the post-match conference."Obviously tensions are running high in the IPL and every run counts and it was probably a big moment in the game, but whether stepping onto the pitch is quite right - I'd say, probably not."Rajasthan Royals suffered their fifth loss of the season, after being in a commanding position against the Chennai Super Kings, a situation they have regularly faced this season."It (the loss) is a tough one to take, getting in a position to win the game but not being able to get over the line.The boys will be very disappointed but that has been the story of our season so far," Buttler said.(With PTI inputs)
MS Dhoni Slammed By Michael Vaughan For Entering The Field In RR vs CSK IPL 2019 Match:::::MS Dhoni left the cricketing world divided after taking the unprecedented step of walking onto the field to protest against an umpiring decision.The incident occurred in the final over of the RR vs CSK IPL 2019 match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Thursday night.Dhoni stormed onto the field after the on-field umpires failed to award Chennai Super Kings a no-ball with three balls remaining.Ben Stokes' delivery appeared to be above the waist with Ulhas Gandhe, standing at the striker's end, raising his arm, only to be overruled by square leg umpire Bruce Oxenford.Even as Ravindra Jadeja protested against the decision, a furious Dhoni walked onto the field to confront the two umpires.However, despite all his efforts, the decision stood.Former England captain Michael Vaughan was not too pleased with the incident, saying there was no place in the game "for a Captain to storm onto the pitch from the Dugout".This is not a good look for the game ... No place at all for a Captain to storm onto the pitch from the Dugout ...!!#IPL Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) April 11, 2019 While some fans agreed with what Vaughan was saying, others thought differently and backed Dhoni's decision to walk onto the field.Vaughan, though, didn't back down and stuck to his guns.Don't tweet utter Rubbish ... As a Captain you have to respect the Umpires decision ... it was a terrible example to set ... https://t.co/A2aICbhOwb Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan) April 12, 2019 The incident took place on the fourth ball of the final over with Stokes attempting a slower ball.The delivery turned into a waist-high full toss with Mitchell Santner still managing to club it away for a double.Santner took another double of the penultimate ball, which was followed by a wide from Stokes.With CSK needing three off the last ball, Santner became an instant Chennai hero by smashing Stokes over long-on for a maximum.
Singapore Open: Saina Nehwal, Kidambi Srikanth Knocked Out In Quarters, PV Sindhu Seals Semi Spot:::::India's Saina Nehwal failed to get past the quarterfinals stage at the Singapore Open after being outgunned by World No.3 Nozomi Okuhara of Japan on Friday.A little later in the day, PV Sindhu survived a scare before making the semifinals, where she will be up Okuhara.In the last match of the day featuring an Indian, Kidambi Srikanth, despite giving a toe-to-toe fight to top seed Kento Momota, eventually lost out 18-21, 21-19, 9-21.In the early match, Saina Nehwal lost in straight games 8-21, 13-21 to bow out of the tournament.The match lasted just 36 minutes as the Japanese shuttler found top form against her Indian opponent.Saina Nehwal had no answers to Nozomi Okuhara's brilliant attacking play, tasting her first defeat against the Japanese in their last 4 meetings.On Thursday, Saina Nehwal had defeated Thailand's Pornpawee Chochuwong 21-16, 18-21, 21-19 in the second round to reach the quarterfinals.Rio Games silver-winner Sindhu defeated world No.18 and 2017 BWF World Junior Championship bronze-medallist Cai Yanyan of China 21-13 17-21 21-14 to set up a meeting with former world champion Okuhara.This is Sindhu's second semifinal of the season, following a last-four finish at the India Open last month.Sindhu broke off at 5-5 in the opening game to earn the bragging rights but her Chinese rival came back strongly in the second game, opening up a lead of 11-6 at the break.The Indian fought back superbly to narrow the lead to 15-16 before Cai marched ahead to take the match to the decider.In the third game, Sindhu once again found her bearings and surged to a lead of 11-5 before the interval.The Indian continued to move ahead and closed out the match comfortably in the end.Kidambi Srikanth, taking on top seed Kento Momota in the men's singles quarterfinals in the evening match, got off to a worst start possible, losing six straight points.He then came up with a fightback to get on even terms with Momota though.The Japanese shuttler then tightened the noose, racing to an 18-12 lead.In what a see-saw first game, Srikanth managed to claw his way back yet again, but Momota squeezed through the first game 21-18.The second game saw some stunning rallies and Srikanth taking the early lead.Parity was restored at 6-6 and Momota took the lead in this game too thereafter.However, Srikanth was not in any mood to concede an inch and finally nosed ahead himself at 16-15 and took the game 21-19 to force a decider.Momota raced to a 5-0 lead in the third game but yet again Srikanth managed to claw his way back.A leaping defence stroke landed just inside the court to give the Indian a 7-6 lead, forcing Momota to sit down on his haunches and stare at the inner line in disbelief.The Japanese started approaching the net a lot more as the decider wore on, leading 11-7 at the last interval.After the interval, Srikanth suffered a capitulation, giving away eight straight points before eventually losing 9-21.
Europa League: Arsenal, Chelsea Put One Foot In Semis:::::Arsenal and Chelsea closed in on the Europa League last four on Thursday after the Gunners saw off highly-fancied Napoli 2-0 at the Emirates, while Marco Alonso's late header earned Maurizio Sarri's side a hard-fought win at Slavia Prague.Unai Emery's Arsenal hold a healthy advantage going into next week's second leg thanks to a fine early strike from Juventus-bound Aaron Ramsey and an unfortunate Kalidou Koulibaly own goal midway through the first half, and can rue missed chances that would have put the tie completely beyond the Italians' reach."To keep a clean sheet and score a couple of goals is a lovely way to start the first leg.We're delighted with that," said Ramsey, who should have added the third when he blazed over with nine minutes left, to BT Sport."We can go into the second leg with a little bit of a cushion, but we know it will be a difficult place to go...They are a quality team."Chelsea meanwhile escaped from Eden Arena after a bitty display that saw Kepa Arrizabalaga have to make some fine saves to keep the Czechs out before Alonso nodded home Willian's pinpoint cross four minutes from time to seal a 1-0 win.The Blues remain unbeaten in the Europa League, keeping eight clean sheets in the competition this season, and it was that solidity that saw them through on a tricky evening in Prague.The Premier League pair remain on a collision course for the final in Baku, with both sides set to avoid each other if they make it through next week's second legs.Arsenal were all over Napoli from the kick-off and got their deserved opener with 14 minutes on the clock, Ramsay waltzing in at the end of a beautiful passing move to calmly stroke home Ainsley Maitland-Niles's neat lay-off.Napoli were completely out of sorts, barely able to get the ball out of their own half at times, and 10 minutes later the Gunners doubled their lead.Former Sampdoria midfielder Lucas Torreira won possession in midfield and charged towards goal before letting off a weak shot that flicked off Koulibaly and flew past a bamboozled Alex Meret in the Napoli goal.Arsenal should have made more of their first-half dominance over Carlo Ancelotti's slipshod side, but were not punished by the Serie A outfit, who through Piotr Zielinski should have bagged an away goal to take back to Naples in the second half."I was surprised by the lack of courage and personality from my players at the start," Carlo Ancelotti told Sky Sport."Turning this around will be difficult now, but we'll be home at the San Paolo, and our supporters will help us."Record-breaking Felix Arsenal will almost certainly take on Valencia should they hold on at what will be an intimidating Stadio San Paolo after the La Liga side scored twice in stoppage time to win 3-1 at fellow Spaniards Villarreal.Goncalo Guedes scored twice, including what could be the decisive third three minutes into added time, as Marcelino's side struck with two clinical breakaway goals to give them a great chance of making the semis.Chelsea meanwhile will likely play Benfica should they go through after 19-year-old Joao Felix became the youngest ever player to score a Europa League hat-trick and set up the other goal in 4-2 win over Eintracht Frankfurt that leaves the Bundesliga side, who had to play with 10 men for 70 minutes, with an uphill task to make the last four in Germany next week.Felix, a revelation in his first season in the Benfica first team, got the ball rolling from the spot in the 21st minute after Evan N'Dicka was sent off for shoving over goal-bound Gedson Fernandes.He put the hosts back in front just before the break after Luka Jovic -- on loan from Benfica -- scored a shock leveller against his parent club in the 40th minute.Ruben Dias made it three when he headed in Felix's flick-on a from a corner, and the 19-year-old side-footed home Alex Grimaldo's cross to complete his treble nine minutes into the second half, before Goncalo Paciencia pulled one back with his head from a corner to keep the tie alive.

MS Dhoni Records 100th IPL Win As CSK Beat Rajasthan Royals In Last-Over Thriller:::::MS Dhoni led from the front and scored a match-winning half-century as Chennai Super Kings outclassed Rajasthan Royals by four wickets at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Friday.With this victory, MS Dhoni became the first captain in the history of Indian Premier League (IPL) to win 100 matches.MS Dhoni has won 29 more matches than Gautam Gambhir, who is second on the list.Mitchell Santner smashed Ben Stokes for a maximum off the final ball to help CSK seal a last-ball thriller.CSK recorded their sixth win in seven games as they made a rough weather of a modest 152 run target before Santner's six sealed in a dramatic final over in which CSK needed 18 runs.Dhoni on his part scored 58 off 43 and added 95 with Ambati Rayudu (57 off 47 balls) for the fifth-wicket.However Stokes got him with a yorker and a clear waist high no-ball to Santner was ruled out by umpire Ulhas Gandhe after trying to raise his arm.This prompted an angry Dhoni to enter the ground and literally blast Gandhe before leg umpire Bruce Oxenford calmed him and sent him back before Santner finished it off in style spoiling a brilliant outing from Jofra Archer (1/19 in 4 overs).Dhawal Kulkarni bowled a perfect away going delivery that squared up Shane Watson (0) while Suresh Raina (4) was beaten by a direct throw.Faf du Plessis (7) soon followed the suit as Rahul Tripathi took a well judged catch at the deep mid-wicket boundary off Jaydev Unadkat's bowling to reduce CSK to 15 for 3.Kedar Jadhav (1) didn't last long but it took an air-borne Ben Stokes to pull off an incredible catch at backward point off Jofra Archer's bowling.At 24 for 4, Dhoni walked in and with two young spinners in Shreyas Gopal and Riyan Parag (0/24 in 3 overs) bowling in tandem, he launched into the duo hitting them for a six each as Rayudu kept on rotating the strike, hitting the odd boundaries in between.Their 50-run stand for the fifth wicket came in 42 balls as Dhoni deposited Gopal into the stands for his third six.Rayudu also did his bit lofting Stokes for a six.Earlier, Chennai Super Kings produced yet another disciplined bowling effort to restrict Rajasthan Royals to a modest 151 for seven in 20 overs.Save Jos Buttler (23 off 10 balls) at the top of the order, none of other Royals batsmen looked the part as CSK skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni's immaculate reading of the track once again helped the defending champions.Left-arm spin duo Ravindra Jadeja (2/20 in 4 overs) and Mitchell Santner (1/25 in 4 overs) checked the run-flow as Royals batsmen were always playing a catch-up game.Even Imran Tahir (0/28 in 4 overs), who went for a few more runs compared to the other two spinners, ended with decent enough figures.Royals skipper Ajinkya Rahane (14 off 11) failed once again with seamer Deepak Chahar (2/33 in 4 overs) trapping him leg before.Buttler belted Shardul Thakur (2/44 in 4 overs) for a few boundaries before he mistiming one which was easily caught by Ambati Rayudu.Once Buttler was gone, Royals lost the momentum as wickets fell at regular imtervals.Steve Smith (15,22 balls) struggled once again as he slog swept Ravindra Jadeja towards deep mid-wicket only to find Rayudu.Samson also top edged a sweep which was caught by substitute fielder Dhruv Shorey.Rahul Tripathi's struggles in the middle-order continued while Ben Stokes' 28 off 26 balls wasn't good enough.It was Shreyas Gopal, who struck a few meaty blows en route his 19 off 7 balls to take the target past 150 despite the home team playing as many as 42 dot balls.(With PTI inputs)
Ben Stokes Takes Spectacular Flying Catch To Dismiss Kedar Jadhav - Watch:::::Ben Stokes has produced what can be called the best catch of the IPL 2019 so far, fielding for Rajasthan Royals in the match against Chennai Super Kings .Standing at point, he came up with a moment of magic in the sixth over of the CSK innings .Kedar Jadhav and Ambati Rayudu were trying to prop up the chase after a few early wickets when Jofra Archar was brought on into the attack in the 6th over.The fifth ball of Archer's over was slashed on the off side by Jadhav, but Stokes leapt to his left to pluck out the fast-travelling ball out of the air.WATCH: @benstokes38 would be 'Stoked' by THAT catch tonight Unbelievable stuff here from Stokes.Watch the video here https://t.co/3sFkdCVCcn #RRvCSK pic.twitter.com/AO2ZnwqgzF IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) April 11, 2019 Getting back on his feet after the catch, Stokes rushed to the third man region as his Rajasthan Royals teammates converged around him and the Jaipur crowd went wild.It was not lost on anyone that Stokes had just produced a rare moment.The home team were brilliant on the field on Thursday on many other occasions as well.Even before Stokes's catch, Rahul Tripathi had produced two great pieces of fielding.A full-length dive by Tripathi saved a sure boundary off Faf du Plessis's bat in the 4th over.A little later in the same over, Tripathi covered a lot of ground to race in from deep midwicket and dive forward to take a catch to dismiss the South African batsman.Stokes had earlier also come up with the highest score in the Rajasthan Royals innings, his 28 taking the team's total to a respectable 151/7 in 20 overs.
MS Dhoni Convinced By Deepak Chahar To Take DRS:::::MS Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings strike bowler Deepak Chahar have exhibited magnificent rapport in IPL 2019 .In the match against Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur on Thursday too, there was a special moment on display between the two of them.Chahar convinced his skipper to take a review of an lbw call against Ajinkya Rahane which had been turned down by the umpire.Dhoni, usually a very astute judge of whether the umpire's call should be challenged, did not look very convinced initially but took his bowler's word just as the stipulated ten seconds finished.Chahar turned out to have been right though, as replays showed that RR skipper Ajinkya Rahane was indeed out lbw.The incident happened in the third over of the match, just as Rajasthan Royals openers Jos Buttler and Ajinkya Rahane looked set to take their team to a big score.With the score at 31 for no loss at the time and Rahane looking to not waste any time, Chahar was varying his pace and length.Rahane stepped out to meet the fifth ball of the over and missed an attempted flick.The ball hit his pad, but the fact that he was shuffling out of his crease at the time of the impact between ball and pad probably convinced umpire Bruce Oxenford that it was not out.Chahar, immediately convinced that he had got his man, rushed to Dhoni to present his point of view, gesticulating wildly.Dhoni smiled, seemingly telling Chahar how the ball might have missed the stumps.Seconds ticked by.As if he had no care in the world, he then asked Chahar, "Sure?"Then, just as the ten seconds got over, Dhoni made the T-sign, signalling that CSK were opting to take the review and consequently the end of Ajinkya Rahane's innings.
MS Dhoni news: 50% match fee fine for MS Dhoni is kid gloving, says Bishan Singh Bedi:::::Am aghast w/media calls on Dhonis invasion o field as most immature protest against Umpires last night..puzzles me https://t.co/8rUsXIiM3b Bishan Bedi (@BishanBedi) 1555069764000 Crkt was never meant to look ugly-never mind if laws o the game are not trespassed-but certain behavioural patt https://t.co/UVWox38Xvj Bishan Bedi (@BishanBedi) 1555071568000 JAIPUR: Former India captain Bishan Singh Bedi on Friday slammed the "timid" authorities that fined CSK captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni only 50 percent of his match fee for an unprecedented confrontation with the on-field umpire during an IPL game."Am aghast w/media calls on Dhoni's invasion on field as most immature protest against Umpires last night...puzzles me no end why sport scribes are petrified of honest expression against erring established stars...why even authorities are shamelessly timid-50% fine is kid-gloving MSD," tweeted Bedi.The incident happened during the match between Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals here."Cricket was never meant to 'look' ugly-never mind if laws of the game are not trespassed-but certain 'behavioural' patterns are tantamount to bringing disrepute to game..nobody was ever bigger than the game which demands highest form of exemplary discipline from players/officials alike," Bedi added.In a rare instance, Dhoni, who was not even meant to be on the field of play, lost his cool and rushed out of the dug-out to challenge umpire Ulhas Gandhe after he flip-flopped on a no ball in a match played on Thursday night.Gandhe had tried to rule a waist high full toss as no ball by RR all-rounder Ben Stokes.But he reversed his decision after square leg umpire Bruce Oxenford did not signal for it.
Singapore Open: PV Sindhu seals semifinal spot; Saina Nehwal, Kidambi Srikanth ousted:::::SINGAPORE: P V Sindhu survived a scare before making the semifinals but Saina Nehwal was thoroughly outplayed in her straight-game quarterfinal loss on a mixed day for India at the Singapore Open badminton tournament here Friday.Rio Games silver-winner Sindhu defeated world No.18 and 2017 BWF World Junior Championship bronze-medallist Cai Yanyan of China 21-13, 17-21, 21-14 to set up a meeting with former world champion Nozomi Okuhara It is Sindhu's second semifinal of the season, following a last-four finish at the India Open last month.The second-seeded Okuhara, hailing from Japan, didn't break much sweat on her way to a 21-8, 21-13 win over sixth seed Saina, a bronze-medallist at the London Olympics.Sindhu broke off at 5-5 in the opening game to earn the bragging rights but her Chinese rival came back strongly in the second game, opening up a lead of 11-6 at the break.The Indian fought back superbly to narrow the lead to 15-16 before Cai marched ahead to take the match to the decider.In the third game, Sindhu once again found her bearings and surged to a lead of 11-5 before the interval.The Indian continued to move ahead and closed out the match comfortably in the end.In contrast, Saina, who had defeated Okuhara in their last three meetings and also enjoyed a 9-4 advantage ahead of this clash, fell apart against the Japanese in a lop-sided clash.Okuhara jumped to a 9-0 lead, a gap which Saina failed to breach, collecting only eight points in the first game.In the second, Saina rose to 4-0 but Okuhara clawed back at 6-6 and then turned the tables, reaching 11-8 at the breather.The Japanese then moved ahead at 12-11 and didn't look back.
More pressure you put on umpires, more difficult it will be for them: Zaheer Khan:::::MUMBAI: The controversial happenings of the last over during Rajasthan Royals game against Chennai Super Kings in Jaipur on Thursday night, which saw CSK skipper MS Dhoni storm onto the field from the dugout and argue with the on-field umpires has triggered a debate about whether Indias star players are intimidating match officials.Earlier, in a thrilling game between Royal Challengers Bangalore and Mumbai Indians in Bengaluru, umpire S Ravi, the only Indian in the ICC Elite panel, had failed to call a no-ball by Lasith Malinga in the end, which prompted RCB skipper Virat Kohli , and later his MI counterpart Rohit Sharma , to openly criticise the quality of umpiring on display."We are not playing club cricket.Umpires need to be smarter," a livid Kohli had lashed out.While Dhoni was fined 50% of his match fee, Kohli and Rohit were not even reprimanded.The Dhoni outburst has also brought the focus back on the poor umpiring standards which threaten to mar IPL 12.However, on Friday, former India pacer Zaheer Khan , now a director of cricket operations at MI, offered sympathy to the umpires, saying that umpiring wasn't "an easy job."He felt that putting "more pressure on the umpires will make their job even more difficult."Quizzed on the questionable umpiring standards in the tournament, Zaheer said: "Well, I think a lot of things have improved and there is always room for improvement.So, in terms of standards of umpiring, its not an easy job and more pressure you put on them, its going to be even more difficult.So thats something which we all need to be aware of, you know, as long as the right call has been made its fine.Yes in this tournament so far we have seen few incidents where things have gone a little out of hand, but as long as umpiring is consistent throughout the game, then it should be ok."There is a thought that one way to avoid controversy is that all no-balls should now be referred to the third umpire."The no-ball, it has been referred to the third umpire on many occasions, especially, you see the game has stopped after a wicket has fallen.The umpire (is just) making sure (about the line).So the measures have been taken through that and there is some room of improvements, for sure.As long as everyone is working in that direction, it should be okay," Zaheer said.

KL Rahul ready to be India's No. 4, but not losing sleep over World Cup selection:::::NEW DELHI: Who will be the designated number four batsman for India at the upcoming ICC ODI World Cup?While many contenders have thrown their hats in the ring for the spot, the Indian selectors will have their task cut out when they will sit down to pick the 15-member squad for the mega event, to be played in England and Wales, starting May 30.The number four conundrum is a big one for India.Since the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy India have tried as many as eleven players at the number 4 position and yet there is no clarity on who will bat at number 4 for India at the World Cup or going forward.The likes of KL Rahul Ambati Rayudu , Dinesh Karthik, Rishabh Pant are all possible candidates.The very talented Vijay Shankar could be part of the World Cup squad and the selectors might want to try him at that position too.KL Rahul's chances of being picked did get a fillip after he scored a brilliant unbeaten 100 in an IPL match recently.Though Virat Kohli had said before the tournament began that IPL performances will not be a benchmark for World Cup selection, current form is something the selectors will be taking into account.In his first seven innings in IPL 2019 , Rahul scored 317 runs, at an astonishing average of 79.25.The 26 year old has scored three fifties and one century so far and is the second-highest run-getter in the tournament so far.It will be fair to say Rahul is hopeful of booking a World Cup berth.Speaking to TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview a week after IPL 2019 began Rahul said, It is the most prestigious tournament for any cricketer in the world.It is the dream of every cricketer to represent the country in the World Cup.It will be a brilliant opportunity.Rahul, who is one of only 15 cricketers who have scored a century on ODI debut, scored 89, while opening the innings against England Lions in an unofficial Test in February this year, before notching up a fifty against Australia in the first T20I in Visakhapatnam in the same month.Rahul has played 14 ODIs so far and scored 343 runs at an average of 34.30.Not surprisingly, he is ready to bat in any position, if given a chance in the quadrennial event."Wherever the team requires me and wants me to fit in, I will go and give my best.If they want me to field, I will.If they want me to bat at No.3, 4 or open, I will be ready as per the team's requirements.It's a team sport," Rahul said on being asked about whether he will be ready to bat at Number 4 if given the responsibility.For now, Rahul wants to focus on his batting and wants his willow to do the talking."World Cup selection is not in our hands.For now, my focus is on IPL.I want to score as many runs for my team (KXIP).I am not thinking and worried about it (World Cup selection).If I get a chance, I will give my best," Rahul signed off.
RCB's dismal IPL run will have no bearing on Kohli's performance in World Cup: Hogg:::::#HoggsVlog: Will RCB's poor form affect KOHLI during the World Cup?Should Warner lead SRH in the absence of Willia https://t.co/2X8pmtaARN Brad Hogg (@Brad_Hogg) 1555034400000 NEW DELHI: Former Australia spinner Brad Hogg on Friday said that RCB's dismal run in the ongoing IPL will not impact India captain Virat Kohli 's performance in the World Cup , beginning May 30.Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore are yet to win a game this season, having lost six matches in a row."There is no way that it will affect Virat Kohli in the World Cup, he is a focused individual and he wants to succeed.Do not worry about Kohli going in the World Cup," Hogg said in a video he has posted on Twitter.Hogg is also not surprised with the forgettable run of RCB, who are the bottom of the points table and are perennial underachievers in the competition."They rely too heavily on Kohli and AB de Villiers, their middle order has not stood up.Also their bowling department in the death overs.They have not executed their plans and they never had the right plans.So management has to sit down and turn things around very quickly," the 48-year-old added.The Royal Challengers will be hoping for their first win this season when they take on Kings XI Punjab in Mohali on Saturday.
IPL 2019: Umpires bungle and stars let it rip:::::NEW DELHI: Sundaram Ravi and Ulhas Gandhe 's bloopers have raised questions on the standard of umpiring in the IPL but it is Mahendra Singh Dhoni's public outburst that has triggered a debate on whether star players get away with intimidating match officials.For the first time in his illustrious career, Dhoni, a two-time World Cup winning former India captain, entered the field of play for an angry confrontation with umpire Gandhe, who backtracked after signalling a no ball during an IPL match on Thursday night."Obviously star players try to pressurise umpires but it's up to the umpires to withstand the pressure.They will do what they feel but it depends on the personality of the umpire," one of India's most well-known international umpires, K Hariharan, said on Friday.As per laws, Dhoni had no right to enter the field of play and has got away with a fine of 50 percent of his match fees, something that will be paid by his franchise Chennai Super Kings.The maximum punishment for this Level 2 offence could have been a two-match ban but even that was liable for appeal.Dhoni's confrontation is the second incident in the first three weeks of the tournament in which a superstar cricketer has blasted the umpire.Earlier, it was Virat Kohli, who was livid with ICC Elite Panel Umpire Ravi for failing to spot a no ball bowled by Lasith Malinga which proved costly for his team in the end."We are not playing club cricket.Umpires need to be smarter," Kohli had lashed out.Even his rival IPL captain and India deputy Rohit Sharma (Mumbai Indians) was critical of the quality of umpiring on that day.However, Kohli was not even reprimanded even though the ICC Code of Conduct clearly states that players cannot publicly criticise umpiring decisions.In Indian cricket, especially the domestic umpires, have always been edgy when put under the pump by star players."For any umpire, it is necessary to have courage to stick to his decision," said Hariharan, who has stood in two Tests and 34 ODIs apart from officiating in first three seasons of IPL.Hariharan then came to the game specifics of the CSK versus Rajasthan Royals clash in which Dhoni had the unprecedented meltdown."Let's get this straight.As per ICC playing conditions, it was square leg umpire Bruce Oxenford's prerogative to check waist high full toss.Umpire Gandhe had no business signalling no ball.He got it wrong."Now coming to commentators and experts.No umpire can go upstairs to check for validity of a no ball if the batsman is not out.So, umpires couldn't have referred it to TV umpire," said Hariharan."Lastly, Mahendra Singh Dhoni had no business entering the ground as that is completely prohibited.For starters, the 50 percent fine is a very light sanction," said Hariharan.He feels that not all umpires are bullied by players and ones consistent with their decisions get respect."A good umpire is one who gets his decisions correct but a great umpire is someone blessed with 'Match Management' skills.It's different from giving decisions.It's about controlling the match."But umpires are human and some decisions can have deep impact as he related one of the most famous bloopers of the pre-Internet social media era back in 1997.It was Hariharan's international debut in an ODI match between India and Sri Lanka at Margao, Goa.Ajay Jadeja got the thickest of edges off a Sajeewa De Silva delivery caught by keeper Romesh Kaluwithrana.The Lankan players started celebrating and then it happened.The famous visual of Umpire RP Sharma raising his finger only to start scratching his hat as Arjuna Ranatunga looked bewildered.Jadeja was unmoved and he got a scratchy 50 after which Ranatunga mockingly shook his hands."I can't forget that match and Professor Sharma's 15th match.He never officiated in any game after that.I wonder what would have happened in today's time when people still remembered a match aired on DD," Hariharan said."My family was there for my debut and in the evening I found him sobbing in his room.He was shattered and depressed.We wanted to take him out for dinner but he was in no position.He was never the same man after that," he recalled.The BCCI mandarins admit that the standard of umpiring has gone down in recent years and lack of quality umpires is an issue.Recently, the BCCI admitted that only 17 umpires are officiating in the IPL.Out of them, 11 are Indian and six foreigners from the Elite Panel.Apart from them, there are six more Indians as fourth umpires."In a tournament which is as hectic as IPL, even umpires can have fatigue due to constant travelling and officiating in every second game," a BCCI official stated, trying to put things in perspective.
Joshna Chinappa enters semifinals at Macau Open Squash:::::MACAU: Third seed Joshna Chinappa moved into the semifinals of the Macau Open with a convincing 11-8, 11-2, 11-9 win over fifth seed Mayar Hany of Egypt on Friday.However, men's second seed Saurav Ghosal suffered an unexpected exit with sixth seed Greg Lobban of Scotland chalking out a 6-11, 11-8, 11-5, 11-8 win for a last four place.Earlier, Ghosal had an energy-sapping second round against compatriot Mahesh Mangaonkar .The scoreline read 9-11, 11-7, 10-12, 11-2, 11-9 after a marathon clash lasting 77 minutes.So frustrated was Mahesh at the missed opportunity that he flung his racket on to the front wall.For Joshna, after a bye in the first round, it was a fairly easy outing against New Zealand's Amanda Landers-Murphy.The Indian won in straight games 11-5, 11-8, 11-9.Knowing the Kiwi's penchant for the volleys, Joshna ensured her rival was not given much of that privilege and the ploy worked.
IPL 2019: Royal Challengers Bangalore get Dale Steyn boost:::::BENGALURU: Putting speculations to rest, Royal Challengers Bangalore on Friday confirmed that seasoned South African pacer Dale Steyn as the replacement for Australian quick Nathan Coulter-Nile The South African is expected to be available for RCB's away game against Kolkata Knight Riders on April 19.Last year too the 31-year-old Coulter-Nile, who was bought by RCB at the 2018 mega auction for Rs 2.2 crore, pulled out of the tournament due to injury and was replaced by New Zealand all-rounder Corey Anderson.While last year he was ruled out before the start of the tournament, this season he has been replaced midway through RCB's nightmarish run which has seen them lose six matches on the bounce.Meanwhile, Steyn, who went unsold in the auction (base price Rs 1.5 crore), returns to the franchise with which he began his IPL journey.Steyn joined the RCB ranks in the inaugural edition when the franchise snapped him up for $325,000 (base price: $150,000).In a three-year stint with RCB starting in 2008, Steyn featured in 28 matches claiming 27 wickets.His best for the team was 3 for 18 in 2010 while he made just three appearances in the 2009 edition in South Africa due to a thumb injury.
Rohit Sharma available for selection: Zaheer Khan:::::MUMBAI: Mumbai Indians Director of Cricket Operations Zaheer Khan on Friday said that skipper Rohit Sharma is available for the team's IPL match against Rajasthan Royals on Saturday.A leg spasm had forced Rohit to miss an IPL game for the first time in 11 seasons when he sat out of Mumbai's last match against Kings XI Punjab at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday.He had sustained the injury during a training session.Asked about Rohit's injury status, Zaheer said, "He is definitely available, available for selection and he is very confident, so that is a very positive sign right now for us."He is going to practice and get a better gauge of things, but we are pretty confident (of him playing)," said the 40-year-old former India pacer who played 92 Test matches.Rohit briefly batted at the nets at the Wankhede Stadium on Friday.
Kovac confirms Lewandowski, Coman bust-up in Bayern training:::::BERLIN: Bayern Munich coach Niko Kovac on Friday confirmed reports Robert Lewandowski and Kingsley Coman were involved in a fist-fight during training, but ruled out any sanctions.Kovac admitted the forwards traded blows following an argument at a training session behind closed doors on Thursday while preparing for Sunday's league game away to Fortuna Duesseldorf."The three of us talked about it, the players are sorry and have apologised for their behaviour, there will be no financial penalties and the matter has been resolved," said Kovac in a press conference.Lewandowski, 30, reportedly chastised Coman, 22, during a training exercise, and the exchange of words quickly escalated.The two players were reportedly separated by defenders Niklas Suele and Jerome Boateng, but Kovac was evasive about the cause of the strife, saying simply "emotions" had run high in a heated training session.Bayern are a point clear at the top of the Bundesliga after their 5-0 demolition of title rivals Borussia Dortmund last week.Yet Kovac's side are still feeling the pressure with six games to go, especially as club chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has said Bayern's head coach does not have a job guarantee."I will concentrate only on football and won't add my thoughts to every little thing - my job as coach has become a side issue and I want to concentrate on the core business at hand," said Kovac.
AIFF sets 'internal deadline' of May 7 to appoint India's new football coach:::::NEW DELHI: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has set an "internal deadline" of May 7 to appoint the new coach of India's senior men's team, after Stephen Constantine resigned following the team's exit from the AFC Asian Cup.On Monday next week, the AIFF Technical Committee is scheduled to meet and discuss the shortlist.The federation reportedly received over 250 applications by the deadline of March 29.The list of candidates has been filtered down to 38 and presented to the Technical Committee."We expect to finalise the candidate by May 7, which is our internal deadline.Of course, it could be extended depending upon discussions with the Technical Committee on Monday," Kushal Das, the AIFF General Secretary, told TimesofIndia.com."We have forwarded a list of 38 names."After the technical committee meeting on April 15, a further shortlist of seven to eight candidates is expected to be drawn up for interviews.Two names that are likely to end up on the final shortlist, if everything goes well, are that of former Bengaluru FC coach Albert Roca and high-profile Swedish manager Sven-Goran Eriksson , who has coached national teams like England, Mexico and Ivory Coast, as well as big clubs like Manchester City and Leicester City.Bengaluru FC clinched the 2017 Federation Cup and the 2018 Super Cup, besides making the finals of the 2016 AFC Cup and the 2018 Indian Super League under Roca.As far as Eriksson is concerned, he had a rather successful five-year term with England, winning 40 of the 67 matches in charge.Under him, England rose from No.17 in the FIFA rankings to No.5.He has also successfully coached clubs in Italy, Sweden and Portugal, besides being Manchester City's first non-English manager.But a lot will also depend on the money demanded by any of the big names who have applied for the post."I can't reveal who has applied for the role, but the final decision will also depend on the available budget (for the salary)," Das told TimesofIndia.com.India's next international assignment is the King's Cup in Thailand from June 5.
Man United can finish in top three with 15 more points: Solskjaer:::::Manchester United can secure a top-three finish in the Premier League if they get 15 points from their remaining six games, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said on Friday.United, lying sixth with 61 points after a poor run of results, are locked in a battle for third with Chelsea (66 points), Tottenham Hotspur (64) and Arsenal (63).Third place would guarantee United qualification for the Champions League - which by Solskjaer's calculation would mean beating at least one out of second-placed Manchester City and Chelsea, who they host in consecutive games at Old Trafford this month."We need as many points as possible and I think if we get 15 we'll be (in the) top three because in those games hopefully we'll beat Chelsea," Solskjaer told reporters ahead of West Ham's visit on Saturday."We want top three.Top four is also an aim ...but we should aim for 15 points.But now it's about West Ham and focusing on (that)."After losing only once in Solskjaer's first 17 games in charge, United have lost four of their last five in all competitions.The Norwegian pinned that decline on a lack of ruthlessness in front of goal, and United failed to register a single shot on target in their 1-0 Champions League quarter-final first leg defeat at home to Barcelona on Wednesday."We've been fantastic but lately we haven't been ruthless or clinical enough in front of goal," Solskjaer said."...We should have won the league games against Wolves and Arsenal with the amount of chances we had.We've been practicing out here and, as a striker, I know how important that little bit of belief and trust in yourself is."Solskjaer said forward Alexis Sanchez was fit but unlikely to play against West Ham."I'm not sure if he's going to be available.He's injury free but not 100 percent sure for tomorrow, maybe more likely for the Barcelona game (next week)."With midfielders Ander Herrera and Nemanja Matic sidelined with injury and full backs Luke Shaw and Ashley Young both suspended, Solskjaer said Matteo Darmian and Marcos Rojo could play a part on Saturday.
IPL 2019: MS Dhoni let off with 50 per cent fine after angry reaction to umpire's call:::::JAIPUR: Chennai Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni escaped a ban and was let off with a 50 per cent fine on his match fee for an unprecedented confrontation with the on-field umpire during the IPL encounter against Rajasthan Royals here.In a rare instance, Dhoni, who was not even meant to be on the field of play, lost his cool and rushed out of the dug-out to challenge umpire Ulhas Gandhe after he flip-flopped on a no ball on Thursday night.MS Dhoni , the Chennai Super Kings captain, was fined 50 percent of his match fees for breaching the VIVO Indian Premier League 's (IPL) Code of Conduct during his team's match against Rajasthan Royals at Jaipur," the BCCI stated.Gandhe had tried to rule a waist high full toss as no ball by RR all-rounder Ben Stokes.But he reversed his decision after square leg umpire Bruce Oxenford did not signal for it."Dhoni admitted to the Level 2 offence 2.20 of the IPL's Code of Conduct and accepted the sanction," it further stated.As it is the case with IPL teams, it's the franchise that will pay the fine on the player's behalf.Dhoni was seen angrily gesturing at Gandhe for backtracking after initially signalling a no ball.It took some convincing from Oxenford for Dhoni to head back to the dugout even though he seemed far from convinced.But the confusion and the ensuing confrontation did not have a bearing on CSK's fortunes.Stokes failed in the final over and Mitchell Santner finished the match with a six to take his team to a four-wicket win in a chase of 152.According to the ICC Code of Conduct, which governs the IPL, showing serious dissent at an umpire's decision by words or action can lead to a maximum punishment of one-Test or two-ODI ban.
Resurgent Kieron Pollard hopes for West Indies recall:::::MUMBAI: After several years of depressing news both on and off the field, good times seem to have returned for West Indies cricket.While on the field, they stunned England with an inspired show, their cricketers continue to sizzle in the IPL almost every day.After a series of heroics by all-rounder Andre Russell for the Kolkata Knight Riders , it was the turn of Kieron Pollard to come to the party for the Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Wednesday night, bludgeoning 10 sixes during his 31-ball 83.Off the field too, there have been good tidings recently.Former team manager Ricky Skerritt beat Dave Cameron, who didnt enjoy a great relationship with the players, by an 8-4 margin to become the new president of Cricket West Indies (CWI).The development has triggered several changes-the West Indies have a new chairman of selectors, and coach Richard Pybus is on his way out too.It has also reignited the hopes of Pollard, who last played an ODI in October 2016, to make it to the West Indies World Cup squad.Every time I get the opportunity to play, I want to do my best, Pollard said after smashing his highest score in the IPL.There has been a lot of turmoil in West Indies cricket over the last couple of years.We have seen in the last couple of weeks theres a change.Pollard was one of the guys blacklisted.The most I can do every time I step on the cricket field is try to put runs on the board.Theres people there who have the job to select (the West Indies team for the World Cup) and lets see how that goes.As I said, I'm 31 years, Chris Gayle is still playing, hes 39, and he's whacking it all around, he said.
IPL 2019: Like players, umpires' code a must, says BCCI treasurer:::::NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings captain MS Dhoni was fined 50 per cent of his match fees for walking into the ground and confronting the umpires during the 20th over of the game against Rajasthan Royals in Jaipur on Friday.With Dhoni admitting to the Level 2 offence, he was fined 50 per cent of his match-fee.But the bigger problem here is the number of howlers we have seen in this edition of the league alone.Speaking to IANS, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) treasurer Anirudh Chaudhry said that it was indeed a scenario where just like players, code of conduct must be brought in even for the umpires.For Chaudhry, the game is of prime importance and any action which makes it suffer needs immediate redressal."It's Indian cricket and of course everyone has a view and is entitled to it and that's an expression of the passion for the game of cricket that makes Indian cricket what it is.When MSD walked out onto the ground, he would have done so in the complete knowledge that he will be fined for it.This was a violation and he has been punished and fined.That matter ends there."When the quantum of punishment is decided for a violation, a lot of factors are considered, including the previous record of the conduct of the player concerned and the entirety of the facts and circumstances of the incident concerned.It is also apparent that the match officials have to pull up their socks.Whether it is the on field calls or the third umpires or the match referees.They need to be consistent and they need to improve their accuracy percentage," he explained.Bringing up the howlers that have taken the limelight away from the game, Chaudhry cited a number of examples wherein the decision-making has left a lot to be desired."I will give the example of MSD.He transgressed the code of conduct and he was fined for it.Earlier in the tournament, Virat Kohli and Chahal transgressed the code as well but they were not fined for it.In both cases it was an atrocious call by the umpire that evoked reactions from the players and we must accept the sense of frustration that they feel and this needs to be addressed.Maybe it is time to consider a system where even the umpires are penalised for atrocious decisions that lead to unwanted situations on the field of play.""The umpires are the custodians of the game and must maintain the highest standards of conduct.The performance of the umpires and the match officials is a really significant part of the issue.I mean when you review these games so far, you have the call regarding the 'Browning' by Ashwin (I refuse to call it 'Mankading' since Vinoo Mankad had warned Bill Brown but despite the warnings, Brown chose to leave his ground), you have that no-ball being missed in that RCB-MI game, you have Ulhas Gandhe signalling a no-ball and then the square-leg umpire vehemently saying no and Gandhe changing his decision.This in the biggest and best franchise league in the world," Chaudhry pointed."There was also an incident this year where a Match Referee out of the blue told a senior Indian player prior to an IPL game to mind his language when he wasn't even talking and when he was confronted with that later he said that it was merely a piece of friendly advice."Anirudh feels that the issue needs to be looked at immediately and hopefully all the issues -- especially regarding the recruitment of umpires and the conduct of exams -- will be looked into by the ombudsman."We need to review the system urgently.The umpire assessment method needs to be sustained if not upgraded.The lack of video cameras to assess umpire performance this year was inexcusable.There have been murmurs about umpire recruitment, about conflict of interest with regard to the umpire examinations etc.and with the appointment of ombudsman one hopes they would be put to rest," he said.A BCCI functionary echoed the sentiments of the treasurer and said that while all other areas are given priority, umpiring has left a huge hole that is ultimately bringing down the reputation of the IPL."You invited the best of players from across the globe and then you see that howlers have become the norm.Every second game you see a mistake and that is terrible advertisement for the game.But who is taking responsibility?There is an academy for umpires in Nagpur.And how many umpires do we have in the international panel?Just S. Ravi.So clearly, there is a lack of ownership."The idea to have Indian umpires was to help them experience top-flight games and the pressures that come with it.But here, they are getting exposed every second game.So, the same must also be happening in the domestic circuit?Just because it isn't televised, you don't see it.This is just the result of a lack of process."In the case of that Malinga no-ball, it came to light only because it was at such a crucial juncture of the game and on an average there may be around 20 no-balls in some games that are being missed out by the umpires.This needs to stop," he explained."When the team did poorly in the 2007 World Cup, a policy was put in place to ensure that the same mistakes aren't repeated.Are we doing this in case of umpiring howlers?Some umpires are heard to be telling others that if you make a mistake, balance it out by giving another decision in favour of the aggrieved team.A proper process needs to be in place if things are to improve.Most importantly, responsibility can't be shrugged off."

Not a good look at all," he wrote, referring to the mankading incident involving Kings XI Punjab skipper R Ashwin and Jos Buttler.Last night's incident happened in the fourth ball of the last over when Ben Stokes bowled a waist high full toss to Mitchell Santner.Initially, it looked as if umpire Ulhas Gandhe was about to signal no-ball only to decide otherwise.Dhoni, who was dismissed in the previous delivery, lost his bearing at the incident and walked into the field of play and took the umpire head-on.He was seen angrily gesturing at the umpire before leg umpire Chris Gaffaney asked Dhoni to leave.Former Indian batsman Aakash Chopra slammed the poor standard of umpiring but also criticised Dhoni for setting a wrong precedent."Umpiring standards have been pretty low in this #IPL and that was a no-ball given and reversed.Enough to feel crossed and miffed.But the opposition captain has no right to walk out on the pitch after being dismissed.Dhoni set a wrong precedent tonight," Chopra wrote in his twitter handle.Badani too was surprised by Dhoni's behaviour."The umpire is well within his right to overturn a No-Ball or any decision on the field for that matter.Surprised with how Dhoni handled it.It was so unlike Captain Cool #RRvCSK," he wrote in his twitter handle.Pragyan Ojha, a left-arm India spinner, also slammed the umpiring standard."Umpiring this season has deteriorated!Some times you feel what do you play for, the cup or the fair play award?," he tweeted.Sanjay Manjrekar too was critical about Dhoni's move in the match against RR.CSK eventually went on to win the match after Santner smashed a six off the last ball to power the team to a four-wicket win.It was Dhoni's 100th IPL victory as captain for Chennai Super Kings, who are now sitting at top of the points table with 12 points in seven games.CSK will next take on Kolkata Knight Riders on April 14.
IPL 2019: I know how to stop Andre Russell, says Kuldeep Yadav:::::KOLKATA: Kolkata Knight Riders have made a fairly good start to their IPL-12 campaign, winning four of the six matches they have played so far.They will be looking to win their third game on the trot at the Eden Gardens their home ground when they take on Delhi Capitals here on Friday.KKR will, however, be looking to put behind the setback they suffered in their last match against the Chennai Super Kings who dominated the game on Tuesday.KKRs left-arm Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav , is up for the challenge against MS Dhonis yellow brigade on an Eden Gardens pitch hardly offers any help to tweakers.The Eden pitch is not the same as it was 3-4 years ago and it will be tough for the spinners to bowl here.It has turned into a very good surface for batting, Kuldeep opined during an interaction with the media on Thursday.Kuldeep, who conceded just 16 runs in his four overs against CSK in Chennai, has his task cut out against big-hitters like Shane Watson, Faf du Plessis and Dhoni.I will have to bowl flatter and maintain a good line and length, said Kuldeep, who has bagged just three wickets in six matches so far.The Indian wrist spinner, however, is happy with his performance.Not getting wickets doesnt mean I am not bowling well.I have matured as a cricketer.Even if Im not taking wickets my economy rate is good, Kuldeep pointed out.I feel, batsmen are being more watchful and not going for the big shots against my bowling.In T20 cricket any bowler can have a bad day and go for runs.Im not a magician who will do well in every match, he added.Asked about his teammate Andre Russell , who has so far racked up 257 runs in six matches, Kuldeep said, If you have observed, Russell doesnt go after the spinners much.He takes his time before attacking them but he is a terror for the pacers.Kuldeep disclosed that he had never bowled to Russell in the nets, but was confident of surprising the West Indian in the World Cup if he happened to come up against him.Ive a different plan against him.I am very clear in my mind about how to stop him, he said.Kuldeep came out strongly in support of India captain Virat Kohli and refused to believe that RCBs poor run in the IPL would have an adverse impact on his skipper in the World Cup.The Kohliled RCB have lost all their six matches so far.Hes one of the best in the world, has broken so many records I dont think he will be affected by RCBs poor show, Kuldeep said.Talking about the hectic schedule in the IPL, Kuldeep said that the late-night finishes are taking a toll on players bodies.This tournament is very hectic.You need to recover well as you often play two matches in a space of three days, which includes travelling to a different venue.So it does take a toll on the body, Kuldeep said.
IPL 2019: Rishabh Pant has to be the finisher who wins games for his team, says Kris Srikanth:::::NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant began this Indian Premier League (IPL) edition with a bang, but it's been a see-saw season for the Delhi Capitals ' wicketkeeper-batsman since then, which has also affected his team's position -- currently in the drop zone at No.6 on the points table.But former India captain Kris Srikkanth believes if Pant can do the finishing job his side, he can consistently win matches for his team.Pant began his stint for the re-christened Delhi franchise by smashing 78 off 27 balls against Mumbai Indians, but his form has been more like a flash in the pan since then with scores of 25, 11, 39, 5 and 18.In comparison, big-hitters like Kolkata Knight Riders' Andre Russell and Mumbai's Kieron Pollard have responded in style during crunch moments to take their team out of a hole.Srikkanth believes Pant has all the qualities to play a similar role, both in the IPL and for India."If there is one Indian cricketer in the IPL and Indian cricket who can emulate a Pollard or a Russell, it's Rishabh Pant," Srikkanth wrote in his column for The Times of India on Friday."I firmly believe that he is one cricketer in India who could win his side be it Delhi Capitals or Indian team games from hopeless situations."Pant has already played for India in all formats, including two overseas centuries (against England and Australia) in five Tests and is almost certain to be included in the ODI World Cup squad."Pant is a special cricketer who has the potential to fire in all formats of the game," Srikanth added."He is not just about white-ball cricket, this guy has shown what he can do in Test cricket as well.Remember his sensational hundred in the fourth innings of the Oval Test against England last year, under trying circumstances?"Srikanth, who himself was known for his aggressive batting at the top of the order, suggested Pant needs to be a little more patient and can learn from how Russell and Pollard target the bowlers."This kid has it in him, but from my observation, I feel that he doesnt give himself enough time to showcase his talent in the middle.He goes too hard right at the start.He needs to play in the 'V' the first few balls, irrespective of the format, maybe push the ball towards long-on and long-off frequently and get his eye in."He has great ability and a range of shots to make it up in the end.Pollard takes that little bit of time before he unleashes his big hits.And also with Pollard and Russell, they target the straight boundaries, long-on, long-off and slightly towards mid-wicket.Pant needs to take a leaf out of Pollard and Russells book," he explained.Delhi, who have won three of their six matches so far, take on the high-flying Kolkata at the Eden Gardens on Friday."Capitals need a special knock from Pant against Kolkata Knight Riders, and a win here for Delhi will be crucial," Srikanth concluded.
U.S. FAA probes sighting of drone over baseball game at Boston's Fenway Park:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it was investigating a report of a drone flying over Bostons Fenway Park during Thursdays baseball game.The Boston Red Sox said Friday that a drone flew over the playing field during the late innings of the game versus the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday.Flying drones around stadiums is prohibited by the FAA when major sporting events take place.Footage aired on TV showed the drone hovering over the playing field.The club said it reported the incident to the Boston Police Department for investigation.U.S. regulators are grappling with how to address drones in unauthorized areas and integrate them into U.S. airspace.FBI deputy assistant director Scott Brunner told a Senate committee last year the agency was concerned that criminals and terrorists will exploit (drones) in ways that pose a serious threat to the safety of the American people.Threats could include surveillance, chemical, biological or radiological attacks or attacks on large open air venues like concerts and sporting events and attacks against government facilities, he said.In January, the FAA said 43 flights into New Jerseys Newark Liberty International Airport were required to hold after a reported drone sighting at a nearby airport, while nine flights were diverted.Major U.S. airports are assessing the threat of drones and have been holding meetings to address the issue.The U.S. Congress last year gave the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security new powers to disable or destroy threatening drones after officials raised concerns about the use of drones as potential weapons.
In Augusta, all roads lead to somebody's home:::::AUGUSTA, Ga. (Reuters) - Augusta National, with its climate-defying azalea blooms and meticulous greens, offers plenty of attraction for visitors eager to catch a glimpse of the worlds greatest golfers at The Masters.The property placed for rent for the Masters golf tournament is seen in Augusta, U.S., in this undated image obtained from social media by Reuters on April 11, 2019.Patrick Patterson/via REUTERS For local residents whose daily commute can often triple in length during the tournament, it offers plenty of reason to leave.Ive been saying since weve moved here: Weve got to get out of town; this is insane, said Jessica Buffkin, an administrative assistant who lives six miles from Augusta National.Buffkin is like hundreds of area homeowners who decide to skip town during the event and rent to tourists, as Augustas hotels bulge to accommodate the areas temporary population boom.Her three-bedroom house got snatched up quickly, securing a $650-a-night rental tenant by January on home rental site Airbnb.Patrick Patterson an Augusta native whos quick to note that he enjoys the tournament bought a property a third of a mile from the course to capitalize on the rental opportunities.Its just a good investment, said Patterson, a member of the military whose three-bedroom house he listed for $1,000 a night.Its really a supply and demand issue.Unlike other golf majors, or sports mega-events like the Super Bowl, which rotate between host cities and towns, The Masters calls Augusta home every year.Its that yearly predictability that helps drive the local home rental market.There are few other markets that are as transformed by a single event as Augusta, Georgia, said Bill Furlong, vice president of North America Business at Vrbo, an online home rental platform.In Augusta, this is the event of the year.A week ahead of the start of the tournament 88 percent of Vrbos listings in Augusta included references to the golf course or the Masters Tournament.This year has seen a rise in rental activity as well: Vrbo said there were 40 percent more listings in the Augusta area the week before the Masters than there were the same time the year prior.Kelly Johnson, who works at her mothers local housing agency Corporate Quarters, says shes also noticed the increase.This has been one our busiest years, said Johnson, who attributed the swell of activity to the inclusion of the inaugural womens amateur event.That could help perpetuate whats become a year-round business, Johnson said, with homeowners itching to list their properties as soon as a week after the tournaments end.All the homeowners get out of town for spring break, said Johnson.Thats obviously a tradition.

Motor racing: Mick Schumacher very like his father, says Binotto:::::SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Ferrari team boss Mattia Binotto says be can see similarities between Mick Schumachers approach to his recent Formula One test and how seven times champion father Michael used to go about racing.FILE PHOTO: Formula One F1 - Bahrain Testing - Bahrain International Circuit, Sakhir, Bahrain - April 3, 2019 Mick Schumacher during testing for Alfa Romeo REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed Schumacher, 20 and a member of Ferraris driver academy after winning the European F3 title last year, made his test debut with the Italian team in Bahrain this month.The outing came 15 years after Michael won the first grand prix in the Middle East at the same circuit for then-dominant Ferrari.I dont think hes looking very similar to Michael but the way hes behaving is very similar, Binotto, who worked closely with the champion during a golden era at Ferrari that ended in 2006, told reporters at the Chinese Grand Prix on Friday.The way he approaches the exercise and the way hes interested in the car, discussing it with the technicians, he added.So even in Maranello, you are looking after him but hes always in the workshop looking at the car, speaking with the mechanics, and I think thats very similar to his father.Schumacher senior, now 50, has not been seen in public since he suffered severe head injuries in a 2013 skiing accident in the French Alps.Mick was second fastest in the test, albeit on softer and quicker tires than anyone else, and said he felt at home in the garage.Binotto said it was hard to assess the test because of the poor weather conditions that day and because performance had never been the aim.It was his very first day on an F1 car; more important for him still in the learning phase, day-by-day, is facing a completely new challenge in his F2 season, he said.I think what was certainly positive was the way he approached the exercise, the approach to the day of testing, never pushing to the limit, trying to improve run-by-run, learning the car, learning the team.I think in that respect he did a very good job: very well focused, concentrated and tried to do the proper job and learn.I think thats the most you may expect on such a day.
Boxing: Khadem to break a barrier for Iranian women:::::ROYAN, France (Reuters) - Two years after a clandestine impromptu training session on the hills of Tehran, Sadaf Khadem will become the first Iranian woman to contest an official boxing fight, hoping to lead the way in the Islamic Republic.Iranian boxer Sadaf Khadem poses before a training session in preparation to her first official boxing bout in Royan, France, April 11, 2019.REUTERS/Regis Duvignau The bout will take place in western France on Saturday after the 24-year-old met with Frenchman Mahyar Monshipour, an Iranian-born former super bantamweight world champion.In 2017, I went to Iran for a promotional event and I ended up organizing a public training session on the hills overlooking Tehran.About 35 people showed up, and there were six women, Monshipour told Reuters.She contacted me on social media to ask me to make her box but I told her it was not possible.Then about a couple of months ago the Iranian federation opened the door for women boxing and we asked them to set up an event.But it became apparent that it would not be possible because they wanted a female coach, female referee... so with the help of the Sports ministry we made her come to France.Next week Khadem will return to Iran, where Monshipour expects her to be met with popular jubilation.He will, however, travel back with her, just in case, to a country where women have started to take off their head scarves in a peaceful protest against the compulsory hijab.If she ends up in custody, I will not let her down, he said.Khadem took up boxing four years ago, being compelled to train in private fitness rooms since public boxing facilities are reserved for men.In Iran, women were allowed to attend a mens soccer game for the first last October.It is easier for wrestling and weightlifting because they are more in our culture, Khadem told Reuters after a training session on Thursday.BREAK THE DAM Some women fight but the bouts are illegal and being held in Turkey with no medical insurance.In France, Khadem trained at the National Institute of Sport and was handed a French license to practice and fight.For the first time she trained among men, and she burst into tears at the end of a session, overwhelmed by her emotions.My parents were worried when I started boxing but they saw I was really loving it so now they are supporting me.Im now steaming ahead, said Khadem.I have been waiting for this moment for so long.I hope this first fight will pave the way and that I will go as far as I can to have my name in the history of Iranian boxing.But Khadem, who weighed around 100 kilograms when she started boxing compared to 68 now, is on a mission.I hope to break the dam.I dont matter.What matters is Mahyar, who made this fight possible.It could have been anyone instead of me, she explained.In my country, there are a lot of women who box, this fight is also for them.Slideshow (12 Images) Khadem, however, took her chance, adding hours to her fitness coach job to get ready for a 3x2 amateur bout where she will sport Irans colors.Downplaying her achievement, she said: Everyone has difficult moments in their lives.In every country it is difficult to do some things.You have to overcome the hurdles.Her opponent, local boxer Anne Chauvin, said she was happy to be part of this fight to help the cause of women.

Hammer says Shields fight will change women's boxing:::::BERLIN (Reuters) - The unifying world middleweight fight between two-time American Olympic champion Claressa Shields and Christina Hammer will change the face of womens boxing, the German said in preparation of the biggest bout of her career.FILE PHOTO: Christina Hammer of Germany (R) punches Diana Kiss of Hungary at the WBF World Championship Middleweight title fight in Ljubljana February 18, 2011.REUTERS/Srdjan Zivulovic/File Photo The 28-year-old Hammer, a multiple world champion over two weight divisions, is undefeated in her ten-year pro career with 24 victories from 24 fights, but knows the bout against Shields is as big as they get.The main event on Saturday night in Atlantic Citys Boardwalk Hall with television coverage and a big crowd, the fight is billed as the biggest in the history of womens boxing and Shields is a worthy opponent.Unbeaten in her eight bouts and with two Olympic golds from London 2012 and the Rio 2016 Games under her belt, the aggressive 24-year-old Shields has three of the four belts and is seen as a slight favorite on home soil.I think the world of womens boxing will change after this, Hammer told Reuters.It is a super fight.This big fight will push womens boxing up.(Broadcaster) Showtime really believes in this fight.We are fighting Saturday evening now.Afterwards fans will be more informed about womens boxing, she said.Publicity aside, Hammer is eager to confirm her world champion credentials in a fight where all four belts WBO, IBF, WBA and WBC will be up for grabs.I feel very good and I am here to win it, she said in a telephone interview from New York.I am in my best shape.It is my time.I have been a world champion for 10 years.I have worked hard and the time has come where you face a great opponent.The soft-spoken Hammer is known for her patience in the ring as she gradually wears her opponents down, as opposed to Shields explosive style.She is a very strong opponent.She knows what she can do in the ring.I have studied her and analyzed her.But this is not the Olympics with three rounds.With 24 (professional) fights, time and experience is on my side.I have to keep her at a distance if she comes close.I have to stay cool and not fall for her gimmicks and show my own style.While there is a bigger spotlight on womens boxing, the purses for the bouts between men and women are far from similar, with some mens fights commanding hundreds of millions of dollars compared to tens of thousands of dollars for the big fights in womens boxing.That is still something that needs to be done.Not much has been done on that yet, Hammer said.We as women have to get this.But ultimately it depends on the fans.If the fans watch then you earn more money.
Disney sees ESPN+ reaching up to 12 million subscribers by 2024:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - ESPN+, Walt Disney Cos sports video streaming service, could attract between 8 million and 12 million paying subscribers by the end of the fiscal 2024 year, the company said on Thursday.FILE PHOTO: A screen shows the logo and a ticker symbol for The Walt Disney Company on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 14, 2017.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo Disneys forecast for significant growth in paying customers in the next few years was disclosed in a presentation of its streaming video strategy to Wall Street.Operating losses for ESPN+ are expected to be $650 million annually in both fiscal 2019 and 2020, Disneys chief financial officer, Christine McCarthy, said during an investor day webcast presentation.But the service, which launched one year ago, should reach profitability by 2023, she said.I view this positively because I think that they need to illustrate the subscriber growth to validate the investment.Theyre putting out some very strong number guides to the market, said Patrice Cucinello, a director at Fitch Ratings.Theyre going guns blazing at direct consumer.As cable and traditional media companies lose subscribers to the likes of Netflix Inc, they are building new streaming video businesses that appeal directly to consumers.Disney launched ESPN+ a year ago as a way to test its streaming services and distribute additional sports content directly to fans, for a monthly or yearly fee.Since then, ESPN+ has drawn millions of subscribers, inked sports rights deals, and seen its mobile app rise in popularity.Disney is also moving forward with its larger plans for Disney+, which will stream its trove of new and classic blockbuster movies.As for current paying sports fans, Disney said the number was currently over 2 million, or roughly what it disclosed in February.Disneys own estimates about ESPN+ growth seemed slightly higher than analysts, though its time frame was longer.Morgan Stanley analysts expect 2.7 million people to be paying for ESPN+ access by the end of fiscal 2019 and 3.9 million by the end of fiscal 2020.By 2022, it could have 6.7 million, Morgan Stanley said.MoffettNathanson gave a more modest outlook, predicting that ESPN+ will end fiscal 2019 flat, with just 2 million subscribers, growing to 4 million by 2022 and 5 million by 2023.Analysts at Citi predicted that ESPN+ would have 4 million paying subscribers by fiscal 2020.
NHL roundup: Marner nets two to lead Leafs past Bruins:::::Mitch Marner scored two goals one on a short-handed penalty shot in the second period and the visiting Toronto Maple Leafs went on to defeat the Boston Bruins 4-1 Thursday night in the opener of a best-of-seven, first-round Eastern Conference playoff series.Apr 11, 2019; Boston, MA, USA; Toronto Maple Leafs right wing Mitchell Marner (16) high fives center John Tavares (91) after an empty net goal against the Boston Bruins during the third period in game one of the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs at TD Garden.Mandatory Credit: Bob DeChiara-USA TODAY Sports William Nylander and John Tavares (into an empty net) also scored for the Maple Leafs.Patrice Bergeron scored for the Bruins, who won a first-round series over the Maple Leafs in seven games last season.Toronto goaltender Frederik Andersen made 37 saves and frustrated the Bruins on several occasions.Tuukka Rask stopped 29 shots for Boston.After tying the game late in the first, Marner was tripped by Jake DeBrusk on a short-handed breakaway early in the second to earn a penalty shot.Marner deked Rask easily for what proved to be the game-winner at 2:47 of the second period.Capitals 4, Hurricanes 2 Nicklas Backstrom scored two of Washingtons three first-period goals, and the Capitals held off a late Carolina rally for a victory in Game 1 of a first-round Eastern Conference playoff series.Backstrom had multiple goals for the third time in his playoff career, coming just over three minutes apart in that opening period.Alex Ovechkin also scored in the first period, and John Carlson notched a hat trick of assists, getting helpers on all three first-period goals.That tied the NHL record for most assists in a period of a playoff game.Hurricanes rookie Andrei Svechnikov scored twice in a span of 2:19 in the third period to cut the deficit to 3-2, but Lars Eller put it away with an empty-net goal in the final minute.Svechnikov (19 years, 16 days) became the youngest player with multiple goals in a playoff game since 1997.Flames 4, Avalanche 0 Mike Smith stopped all 26 shots he faced to earn the shutout, and Matthew Tkachuk scored twice as host Calgary beat Colorado in the first game of their opening-round Western Conference playoff series.Smith was undoubtedly the star while posting his fourth career playoff shutout and adding an assist in the process.His teammates rewarded him with more than enough offense.Andrew Mangiapane broke the deadlock late in the second period for his first playoff goal, and Mikael Backlund also found the net.Avalanche goalie Philipp Grubauer made 28 saves in the loss.Field Level Media

(Reuters) - Jason Day tweaked his notoriously bad back picking up his daughter before the first round of the Masters on Thursday, but battled his way to a two-under-par 70 at Augusta National.Former world number one Day has endured back issues for much of his career, and only a month ago pulled out after less than seven holes at the Arnold Palmer Invitational with what he described as a disc tear.But he was not about to make an early departure from the Masters too, instead lying on his back on the course to receive treatment from his trainer before continuing.Walking gingerly, he swung within himself and was rewarded with a performance that left him within striking distance of the leaders, four shots behind Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka at Augusta National.Day declined to speak to the media afterwards, but fellow Australian Adam Scott did.He seems to have a bad back all the time and plays great, said 2013 Masters champion Scott.
Not-so-mad scientist DeChambeau puts on clinic with 66:::::AUGUSTA, Ga.

Mickelson mirrors last Green Jacket performance in first round:::::Phil Mickelson of the U.S. hits off the fourth tee during first round play of the 2019 Masters golf tournament at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S., April 11, 2019.REUTERS/Brian Snyder AUGUSTA, Ga. (Reuters) - It was deja vu for Phil Mickelson at the Masters on Thursday, after the 48-year-old posting a five-under-par 67, a repeat of his first-round performance at Augusta National in 2010, the last time he picked up a Green Jacket.Mickelson gave the younger challengers a run for their money, finishing one stroke behind co-leaders and fellow Americans Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau.Mickelson, however, said he set less lofty goals for the first round of his latest Masters bid, saying after the round that he was just hoping to shoot in the 60s.The five-times major winner made back-to-back bogeys at the start of the back nine, a stumble that perhaps could have rattled a less experienced player.After going in the water at 11 to hit that close and have an easy bogey and then to make a sixfooter for bogey on 10 after a terrible drive, those were almost momentum maintainers, if you will, that kept me in it, Mickelson said.He went on to make five birdies in the last seven holes, completing seven on the day.Mickelson, who last won a major at the Open in 2013, would be the oldest Masters champion in history if he wins this year.
Major monster Koepka shares first-round lead at Masters:::::AUGUSTA Ga.

New Footage Shows Conor McGregor Cellphone Incident at Miami Beach Hotel:::::RAW: MMA star Conor McGregor is seen smacking a cellphone out of a man's hand and stomping on it outside the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel in new footage of the incident that led to his arrest last month.MMA star Conor McGregor is seen smacking a cellphone out of a man's hand and stomping on it outside the Fontainebleau Miami Beach hotel in new footage of the incident that led to his arrest last month.The new surveillance footage, released by Miami-Dade prosecutors Wednesday, shows the 30-year-old McGregor among a group of people outside the hotel the morning of March 11, hours before his arrest on strong-arm robbery and criminal mischief charges.McGregor, wearing white pants and a polo shirt, is seen outside the hotel with his entourage as a few bystanders film him with their cellphones.McGregor suddenly smacks the phone out of one man's hand, stomps on it, then picks it up and starts to walk away, as he's surrounded by his security.An arrest report said the man approached McGregor and attempted to take a picture of him while exiting the hotel around 5 a.m. "The defendant slapped the victim's phone out of his hand, causing it to fall to the floor.The defendant then stomped on the victim's phone several times, damaging it," the report said.The report said McGregor picked up the 22-year-old man's phone and walked away.The man told police the phone was valued at $1,000.Police later located and arrested McGregor, who posted bond and left jail hours later.McGregor's attorney called the incident a "minor altercation.""Mr. McGregor appreciates the response of law enforcement and pledges his full cooperation," the attorney's statement read.Meanwhile, Miami-Dade County court records showed that the owner of the phone, Ahmed Abdirzak, filed a lawsuit seeking more than $15,000, accusing McGregor of battery, assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress.McGregor's criminal defense attorney called the lawsuit "a quick effort seeking a payday."Weeks after the arrest, McGregor announced his retirement on social media.McGregor pleaded guilty last year to disorderly conduct in exchange for community service following a backstage brawl in New York City.McGregor's probation period for that case ended less than a week prior to the South Florida arrest.
Video Evidence Could Hurt Kraft in Prostitution Case: Attorneys:::::Lawyers for Patriots owner Robert Kraft filed a motion to suppress all video evidence in the solicitation case against him.Lawyers for New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft have asserted that video evidence capturing him paying for sex at Florida spa could "destroy" his chances at a fair trial.Kraft's legal team made the assertions in a legal filing released in Palm Beach County, Florida, where the 77-year-old Brookline, Massachusetts, resident is currently facing two misdemeanor counts of soliciting another for prostitution at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa."It should be common ground that disclosure of the Videos would compromise the privacy interests of the individuals captured on tape in ways that transcend the misdemeanor prosecution at hand," his attorneys wrote in the motion, arguing that if the videos of the alleged illict acts were to be released, it would "destroy any prospect" of Kraft getting a fair trial.Prosecutors say investigators caught Kraft engaging with an illicit sex act with alleged prostitutes on video at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa on two separate occasions, including once hours before this year's AFC Championship Game.Kraft has denied engaging in criminal activity and has requested, in a separate motion, that the footage and related evidence be sealed pending further order of the court.His attorneys have also previously argued that the hidden cameras violated constitutional privacy protections.The separate motion has been opposed by several news media outlets and would bar prosecutors from the showing the video footage to jurors at trial if successful.A hearing on the motion is slated for this coming Friday.
Meet the 1st Male Patriots Cheerleaders in Decades:::::Two men will be the first male Patriots cheerleaders since the early 1980s.For the first time in decades, the New England Patriots will have male cheerleaders on the sidelines this season.Two men were selected to be on the squad for the upcoming season."Walking (into tryouts), I knew people were going to look at me one, because I am over 6 feet tall, and two, because I am a male," said 23-year-old Driss Dallahi of Londonderry, New Hampshire.Months before his audition in March, Dallahi went to the squad's optional workshop and realized he wasn't alone.'WikiLeaks' Founder Julian Assange Arrested WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was arrested and carried out of the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on April 11, 2019.(Published Thursday, April 11, 2019) He met Steven Sonntag."I attended that workshop and walked in and heard there was another boy, and so I was immediately looking around trying to find him," said Sonntag, 22, of Colchester, Vermont.They didn't know each other until they realized they had the same dream."We didn't really know the criteria for male cheerleaders auditioning for the New England Patriots, so we kind of created that together in texting back and forth," said Sonntag.They coordinated colors and styles of clothes to wear so they wouldn't look off or out of place.The two were the only men that auditioned, and both made the roster, becoming the Patriots' first male cheerleaders since the early 1980s.A Timeline of WikiLeaks' Julian Assange's Time in Self-Exile WikiLeaks' founder Julian Assange had spent up to six years in self-imposed exile at the Ecuadorean embassy in London until he was forcibly carried out and arrested by British police.These were the events that led up to it.(Published Thursday, April 11, 2019) "I was excited," said Tracy Sormanti, the Patriots' director of cheerleading, when asked about first seeing the two at tryouts."Change is good."For decades, Sormanti, who was once a cheerleader herself, has led the squad."They were not selected because they were the first men to try out," said said."They were selected because they actually had the talent."Sonntag started cheering in high school and created the team at Dean College.Dallahi just spent the last year and a half in New York City auditioning for jobs, but his biggest break would come back home in New England.Dallahi's specialties include aerials, which Sormanti said she's brainstorming ways to incorporate into their acts.First Black Hole Photo Unveiled Scientists unveiled the first image of a black hole during a press conference discussing the footage captured from the Event Horizon Telescope (Published Wednesday, April 10, 2019) Both men pointed to the LA Rams' cheerleading team as their inspiration to tryout."At least in my lifetime, it was the first time I had seen two men do something like that," said Dallahi.Last season, Quinton Peron and Napoleon Jinnies gained national attention for becoming the first male cheerleaders to perform at a Super Bowl.Both Dallahi and Sonntag reached out to them on social media for advice and were warned about what they might hear in the stands or read online."If there are people that aren't 100 percent on board today, then maybe somewhere down the line, they are, once we actually get out there," said Dallahi.Sonntag calls this the new generation of cheerleading in the NFL."Two genders on the squad is a big step for any team in the NFL, because that's not what people are used to seeing sidelines, so I encourage it to progress even more across the NFL board," said Sonntag.Now that they're on the team, they will make public appearances in the community serving as ambassadors for the Patriots.Their first performance will be during the Patriots' preseason.
Magic Johnson Steps Down as Lakers President:::::Los Angeles Lakers President of Basketball Operations and Hall of Fame player, Magic Johnson, announces his resignation before the team's final game of the season.Earvin "Magic" Johnson dropped a bombshell on Tuesday night ahead of the Los Angeles Lakers' final game of the 2018-19 season when he suddenly announced that he's stepping down as President of Basketball Operations for the Los Angeles Lakers, multiple outlets reported."Today, I'm going to step down as the president," Johnson told a stunned crowd of reporters gathered outside the Lakers' locker room.After saying "I'm free" at one point, Johnson added, "I feel like a monkey has been lifted off my back."The 59-year-old held nearly an hourlong impromptu press conference where he told reporters that Jeanie Buss, the Lakers' owner, had not been informed of his decision."She doesn't know that I'm standing here, because I would be crying like a baby in front of her, even though I'm about to cry right now," a visibly emotional Johnson said.Johnson, who took over as Lakers president of basketball operations in February of 2017, shared that he felt restrained by his position, citing his desire to be present for Miami Heat guard Dwyane Wade's final game, help mentor tennis player Serena Williams, assist in developing Philadelphia 76ers guard Ben Simmons and share public support for Russell Westbrook achieving a historic with a 20-rebound, 21-assist, 20-point game."I had more fun on the other side," Johnson said.The man who won five NBA titles as a player shared frustrations regarding multiple tampering investigations by the league office and his inability to mentor young men outside the organization.Johnson said, "I was like, 'I have a great life outside of this.What am I doing?'So, I'm going to go back to that beautiful life.And I'm looking forward to it."He added, "I was happier when I wasn't president."When asked about his message to the fans, Johnson said, "We're heading in the right direction.Just hang in there.Everything's OK." Later, Buss took to social media and tweeted, "Earvin, I loved working side by side with you.You've brought us a long way.We will continue the journey.We love you.""There is no greater Los Angeles Laker than Earvin Johnson," the Lakers said in a statement."We are deeply grateful to Magic for all that he has done for our franchise as a player, an ambassador and an executive."Johnson's greatest achievement as an executive would undoubtedly be bringing LeBron James to Los Angeles on a four-year contract.During his tenure as head of Lakers basketball operations, Johnson oversaw a major overhaul of the roster.Brandon Ingram is the only player on the current roster that was on the team when Johnson took over.After he completed the press conference, Johnson proceeded to give hugs to media members present, adding with his trademark smile, "This is it for me."

Report: NYPD Investigating Alleged Rape Involving Kristaps Porzingis:::::Kristaps Porzingis at his first practice with the Dallas Mavericks, Monday, Feb. 4, 2019.An attorney for Kristaps Porzingis acknowledged Saturday that a woman has accused the NBA star of rape, but says the Dallas Mavericks forward "unequivocally" denies the allegation.Lawyer Roland Riopelle said the claim against the player was part of an extortion attempt that is being investigated by the FBI.Citing unidentified law enforcement officials, the New York Post and other news organizations reported earlier that a woman went to police Thursday and said Porzingis raped her in his Manhattan apartment last year while he was playing for the Knicks.NYPD officials declined to comment.While playing for the Knicks last year, Porzingis suffered a major knee injury during a game at Madison Square Garden against the Milwaukee Bucks that the Knicks lost.He then went home and invited the woman to his luxury Manhattan apartment where she alleges she was sexually assaulted, the Post said the woman told police."We made a formal referral to federal law enforcement on December 20th, 2018, based on the accuser's extortionate demands," Riopelle said in a statement.The attorney says the NBA was also notified.Porzingis, a 23-year-old native of Latvia, was traded to the Mavericks in January.But he's not expected to play with the team until next season while he recovers from the injury.The Dallas Mavericks told NBC 5 they have no comment on the investigation.
Lakers Announce LeBron James Will Miss Remainder of Season:::::The Los Angeles Lakers announced on March 30, 2019, that LeBron James will miss the remainder of the regular season.That "thud" sound you hear is the Lakers season coming to an abrupt end.The Los Angeles Lakers announced on Saturday that superstar LeBron James would miss the remainder of the season in order to ensure his left groin strain, suffered on Christmas Day, will fully heal.Sure, there're only six games left in the season, and the Lakers were eliminated from the postseason over a week ago.But James has played in three of the team's last four gamesall victoriesand still appears to be as dominant as ever, and at the very least fans across the country were still coming out to see him play.After an atrocious month of February, the Lakers opted to place James on a minutes restriction for the remainder of the season, and not play him on the second night of back-to-backs.Earlier, when asked if he would sit for the remainder of the season, James stated that he would have a discussion between his team and the Lakers' front office, but added that when he's out on the court, he's going to give it everything he's got in order to pay respect to the basketball Gods above.James has only played in 55 games this season, meaning when all is said and done, he will have missed a career-high 27 games during his 16th NBA season.Despite the lengthy absence off the court, the 34-year-old still averaged 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds and 8.3 rebounds this season, his first with the Lakers.The Lakers, who have missed the playoffs for the last six seasons, issued a statement by President of Basketball Operations, Earvin "Magic" Johnson and General Manager, Rob Pelinka, on their website on Saturday afternoon: "After consulting with our team doctors and medical staff, we have decided to hold LeBron out of games for the remainder of the season.This decision will allow his groin to fully heal, and is best for the future success of both LeBron and the Lakers."Thus ending a tumultuous first year in Tinseltown for LeBron, in a season which will prove to be both a cautionary tale for future franchises and go down in the history books as a wasted year for one of the best talents the NBA has ever seen.The organization announced James will still travel with the team on their upcoming two-game road trip to New Orleans and Oklahoma City, and will certainly be in attendance for the team's remaining three (four if you count the Clippers) home games at Staples Center.With James not on the court, the Lakers are certainly hurting their chances of winning any of their six remaining games, five of which are against playoff teams in the Western Conference.Without James, the Lakers will be looking to evaluate their young talent for next season, as well as hopefully falling into the NBA lottery, guaranteeing them at the very least a top-10 pick in this summer's NBA draft.The extended rest will allow James to get a jump on his offseason entertainment projects, which include multiple television shows and the feature film, "Space Jam 2."James will also be able to begin courting some of the prized NBA free agents this offseason, including Kevin Durant, Kawhi Leonard and former teammate Kyrie Irving.
A Boxer Planted a Kiss on an Unsuspecting Reporter. Now She Has Gloria Allred in Her Corner:::::Jenny SuShe, who covers sports and entertainment for Vegas Sports Daily, was wrapping an interview with boxer Kubrat Pulev after a fight in Costa Mesa when he kissed her.A reporter surprised by a boxer's kiss planted during an interview now has attorney Gloria Allred in her corner, and she says she's trying to make it clear that what happened is not OK. Jenny SuShe, who covers sports and entertainment for Vegas Sports Daily, was wrapping an interview with boxer Kubrat Pulev after a fight in Costa Mesa.Toward the end of the interview, he kisses her."So if Tyson Fury gets through Tom Schwartz do you think you should have a shot?"she asks.After answering "yes," he grabs her by the chin, and plants a kiss on her mouth.In the video, she laughs and says, "OK." As she's pulling the camera down, she says "Jesus Christ."In the social media flurry following the release of the video, with some even calling Pulev the "R. Kelly of Bulgaria," some argued that it was inappropriate to treat a reporter this way.Pulev took to Twitter to have his own, tweeting that "Jenny" is his friend, and that there really was nothing to it.SuShe clearly did not feel this way, according to a series of retweets, and the decision to lawyer up with Allred."I did not encourage, nor consent, to Mr. Pulev grabbing my face, kissing me, or grabbing my backside," SuShe said at a news conference."I was there at the event, covering the match as a professional member of the press."Reporters asked where the line is in situations where, like Pulev, he may consider the reporter a friend."Even if it were a situation where he was her friend, which he was not, he would still need permission to kiss her on the lips," Allred said."A woman has the right to consent or say no.She was doing her job."Other media outlets reported that Pulev was to be suspended.NBC4 reached out to California State Athletic Commission.A spokesperson would only say the incident was under investigation.

MLB Suspends San Francisco Giants CEO Larry Baer for Altercation With Wife:::::FILE - In this Jan. 19, 2018, file photo, San Francisco Giants President and CEO Larry Baer is shown during a press conference in San Francisco.Baer recently took a leave of absence from the team after the release of a video that appeared to show him in a physical altercation with his wife.Major League Baseball has decided to punish San Francisco Giants President and CEO Larry Baer following a public altercation with his wife in which the couple tangled over a cellphone and Baer's wife fell to the ground.The league on Tuesday announced Baer has been suspended without pay through July 1 in connection with the March 1 incident.Baer will not be allowed to have any involvement with the operations of the team during his suspension, according to the league."Based on my review of the results of the investigation, I have concluded that Mr. Baer's conduct was unacceptable under MLB policies and warrants discipline," MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement."In determining the appropriate level of discipline, I find that Mr. Baer should be held to a higher standard because as a leader he is expected to be a role model for others in his organization and community.Based on my conversation with Mr. Baer, it is clear that he regrets what transpired and takes responsibility for his conduct."The incident garnered national attention after a video posted on TMZ Sports showed the couple in a heated argument during which Baer appears to pull his cellphone from his wife, Pam, as she clings to the device and is seen tipping over in her chair and falling to the pavement.In the video, Baer's wife, Pam, can be heard screaming: "Oh my God, no, help!"The San Francisco District Attorney's Office did not charge Baer, saying the evidence did not support criminal charges.Baer publicly apologized for the incident and took leave from the Giants.It's possible his role with the organization as a representative at community events and celebrations could be scaled back moving forward.And he will no longer be the reprentative for the Giants with Major League Baseball.He issued the following statement regarding the suspension: "I respect and accept the Commissioner's decision, and appreciate the fair and thorough process undertaken by MLB and the Giants.I made a serious mistake that I sincerely regret and I am truly sorry for my actions.My unacceptable behavior fell well short of what must be demanded of every person, particularly someone in my position and role in the community.I will now immediately begin the significant work ahead of me to listen and learn from my mistakes and to seek professional advice.I am committed to doing what it takes to earn the trust and respect of the many people impacted by my actions."Rob Dean, the son-in-law of late Giants principal owners Harmon and Sue Burns, will take over day-to-day operations of the ballclub on an interim basis, but it's believed he'll continue in that role once Baer returns in July.
In Announcing Esports Arena, Philly Looks to Capitalize on a Booming Industry:::::Competive gaming is a booming industry.Now, Philadelphia will soon be home to an arena dedicated solely to a video game franchise.Check out the preview.In many ways, he's a lot like other professional athletes.He spends countless hours honing his craft, jet-setting to far-flung venues to play in front of large, boisterous crowds.He signs autographs and takes selfies with admiring fans.But this is no conventional sportsman playing a conventional sport.This is Cormac "Doolsta" Dooley.Only 18 and not even out of high school yet, he's part of a growing industry once derided by some parents as a mindless waste of time that has quickly exploded into a global, lucrative profession: esports."Even if you win one $50,000 tournament, that's pretty much some people's wages for a year.So there definitely is a lot of money to be made," Dooley said.Cormac "Doolsta" Dooley Photo credit: Philadelphia Union A Spectator Spectacle Competitive gaming has become so profitable in recent years that large media companies are getting in on the act.Comcast Spectacor announced Monday that it will build a dedicated esport stadium in the heart of the South Philadelphia Sports Complex.The 3,500-seat, $50 million Fusion Arena will play host to local professional team Philadelphia Fusion already owned by Comcast Spectacor."This will be the first ground-up [esports] facility in the western hemisphere," Spectacor Chief Business Officer Joe Marsh said.The 60,000 square-foot arena, slated to open in 2021, also will feature a training facility and represents another revenue stream in the ever-expanding competitive gaming ecosystem.A rendering of the exterior of Fusion Arena.Photo credit: Comcast Spectacor For a city like Philadelphia, an arena will likely mean added revenue, said Rob Johnson, the chief marketing officer for N3rd Street Gamers, a Philadelphia-based company that's taking advantage of a hole in the still-developing esports market.Just for the amateur tournaments that N3rd Street hosts, both players and spectators travel from around the country, thereby boosting local economies, Johnson said.Last year, the Barclays Center in Brooklyn sold out more than 20,000 tickets for the grand finals of the Overwatch League, in which gamers compete in the popular Blizzard Entertainment game "Overwatch."A professional venue in Philadelphia, according to Johnson, could attract a global audience."The exposure is to Philadelphia.They need to stay somewhere in hotels.They need to eat somewhere.So the economic impact is very, very high, I would believe," he said.A Billion-Dollar Bet "I made the switch over to N3rd Street Gamers a couple months ago knowing that the over double-digit growth year after year of competitive gaming, it's not slowing down," Johnson said.Johnson spent years doing marketing for the NFL and NHL before making the switch to the competitive gaming world.He said the days of video games being perceived and derided as a hobby reserved for recluses playing alone in their basements are gone, replaced instead by an ecosystem that's churning out cash for those who know how to capitalize on it.Professional-level esports are predicted to generate $1.1 billion in 2019 through a combination of sponsorship and media rights deals, game publisher fees and advertising, merchandise and ticket sales, according to gaming research agency Newzoo.Thirty-seven percent or $409 million will be generated in North America alone, Newzoo predicts.Newzoo's figures don't take into account the money that could be made outside of professional-level competitions.Other avenues also exist, including the monetization of non-competitive gaming through services like YouTube and Twitch, the latter of which was bought by Amazon for $970 million in 2014."Still," Newzoo notes, "live streaming around non-organized competitive gaming is an exciting industry in itself, full of its own developments."Even Google has gotten in on the action.The company recently announced its intention to launch Google Stadia, a streaming service akin to Netflix but which would instead allow people to play games without needing a traditional console.The rise in competitive gaming has been spurred largely by changing, nonlinear media consumption habits from younger generations, Johnson said."The eyeballs are shifting to a different medium, and a lot of that is becoming video games."Newzoo predicts that this year, 453.8 million people will watch professional esports globally.By 2022, it expects that audience to balloon even further, to 645 million people.This has prompted traditional companies to shift their own eyeballs in the direction of esports.Fusion Arena is only the latest in a series of moves by Comcast to capitalize on competitive video gaming.In 2017, the media giant announced the creation of the Fusion, which competes in the Overwatch League.Last year, Disney announced a multiyear deal with Activision Blizzard to air the Overwatch League playoffs and finals on ABC, ESPN, ESPN 2 and Disney XD, bringing competitive video games to television screens.But though traditional media conglomerates are pouring big money into the industry, there's still a lot of room for others to take advantage of the changing landscape.N3rd Street Gamers' niche, for example, is largely in player development.Unlike traditional sports, which began at the amateur level and gained popularity before players ever considered themselves professional, modern esports took the opposite route, Johnson said."With esports, it seems that it just went pro and then the infrastructure wasn't built to get people there," he said.N3rd Street's goal is to bridge that amateur-to-pro pipeline by eliminating barriers to entry for causal gamers."Gaming can be expensive.A lot of the high-end PCs, they're thousands of dollars each," Johnson said.To help ease the financial burden, N3rd Street allows people to play at its "Localhost Arena" in Northern Liberties.Here, players not only have access to modern gaming equipment that they might not otherwise be able to afford, but they're also provided with opportunities for training bootcamps.A N3rd Street Gamers Localhost Arena in Philadelphia Photo credit: N3rd Street Gamers Last year, the company also announced the creation of the National Championship Series, a series of amateur tournaments throughout the country that provides cash prizes and tracks player development through a points system.From "Good" to "Pro" Dooley was himself one of the beneficiaries of N3rd Street's work.Last year, he was a 17-year-old fan of the popular EA Sports franchise "FIFA."The West Chester East High School student was good.He often beat his friends, but he wasn't a pro.Then came the Union Esports Open, in which Major League Soccer team Philadelphia Union worked with N3rd Street and Independence Blue Cross to host a tournament that would determine which player would represent the team at the eMLS Cup.Cormac "Doolsta" Dooley poses with his parents.Photo credit: Philadelphia Union "I didn't really realize I was a top-level player until I won the Union tournament, where I beat a pro in the final who was one of the best in America," Dooley said.Following that win, he not only got signed by the Union, but managed to sway his previously unconvinced parents.Like many older non-gamers, they didn't quite understand what all the hype was about."They didn't like me playing that much.Even when I'd be sick from school or something, sometimes my dad would just think I was faking and take the controllers because he didn't want me playing," Dooley recalled with a laugh.But then they saw the crowds and the prize money.Dooley was now able to come to his parents and say he wanted to quit his job as a bus boy making $5 an hour plus tips in order to play FIFA.It's been a whirlwind since.Now he gets flown to Boston, Atlanta, Dallas, Los Angeles, Paris and Bucharest.He's pretty certain he'll qualify for a tournament that takes him to Berlin.Today, he's competing for a triple-figure pot in London.Last week, a tournament win scored him $10,000.Not bad for a high schooler."It is completely surreal," Dooley said."When I look back at this time last year, I was working hard like most high school students, just at a restaurant or something, and now flip the scripts onto a year and I'm making a good bit more money than what I was making there doing that."All that was born from one video game tournament.Niche Goes Mainstream Even excluding the win bonuses, players at these tournaments even at the amateur or semi-pro level can still benefit from the exposure to sponsors and even college scouts who might be watching in the crowd.This embrace of esports by institutions of higher learning to date, 135 accredited U.S. colleges are listed as being a part of the National Association of Collegiate Esports underscores another indication of esports' staying power: it has permeated into everyday life, with no sign of stopping any time soon.Soccer superstar and French World Cup winner Antoine Greizmann has embraced the "take the L" celebration found in "Fortnite."Lakers player Josh Hart has taken to the court in his own custom Fortnite shoes.Former UFC flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson has his own channel on Twitch.Some gamers have become transcendent millionaires.Last year, Tyler "Ninja" Blevins became the first professional esports player to grace the cover of ESPN Magazine."It's becoming mass-audience, it's becoming more pop culture," Johnson said.These days, it's no longer a question of whether or not competitive gaming can catch on in the mainstream.Increasingly, it is the mainstream.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal, which owns this TV station.
