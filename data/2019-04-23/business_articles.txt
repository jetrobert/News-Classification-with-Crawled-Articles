Roy Disney’s granddaughter slams Bob Iger’s ‘insane’ salary:::::An outspoken Disney heirs criticisms of CEO Bob Igers pay as insane has cast a Klieg light on the industrys executive pay.And the award for the highest paid CEO goes not to Iger who earned $65.6 million in 2018, up 81% from the previous year but to Discovery CEO David Zaslav, whose 2018 compensation surged 206% to $129.4 million.The competition was kicked off Sunday by Abigail Disney, the granddaughter of Disney cofounder Roy O. Disney, who on Twitter blasted Disney for paying Iger 1,424 times what the median Disney employee earns.Let me very clear.I like Bob Iger, she said.But by any objective measure a pay ratio over a thousand is insane.A Disney spokesperson defended the CEOs pay, saying, Mr. Igers compensation is 90 percent performance-based and he has delivered exceptional value for shareholders.The thread stirred enough outrage for BTIG analyst Rich Greenfield to join the fray Monday with a Twitter chart shining a light on CEO pay in the media, tech and telecom industries.We played off of what Abigail wrote, he said in a phone interview, but we couldnt help constructing the issue as a compensation problem not just for Disney but for the entire media industry.The chart focused on 11 TMT companies, and the data showed that some CEOs got big payouts even as investors lost money.Over at Facebook, for example, CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw his pay jump 147.8% in 2018, while the stock fell 25%.And at CBS, interim CEO Joe Ianniello got paid $27.4 million even as the stock dropped 25.9%.Greenfield said he was taken aback by the CBS boards decision to pay Ianniello $27.4 million for just a few months of work or just a few hundred-thousand dollars less than the $29.4 million earned by Netflixs Reed Hastings.Why is CBS CEO making almost as much as Netflixs?Greenfield asked of Ianniello, who was put in the top spot in September after longtime boss Les Moonves left amid sexual harassment allegations.Indeed, while CBS shareholders lost 26% in 2018, Netflix stock jumped over 39%, Greenfield said.The charts outlier was Twitters Jack Dorsey, who received no compensation in 2018.Even Zuckerbergs pay of $22.6 million might be considered small potatoes compared to the companys $509 billion valuation.AMC, by contrast, is valued at just $2 billion yet the theatre chains CEO, Adam Aron, took home $9.5 million last year even as the stock declined 18.7%.When you see the CEO of an old-fashioned theater chain making $10 million while its stock fell nearly 20 percent, its nothing short of eye-opening, Greenfield said.One consolation for Disney investors might be the 18% gain in the stock last year.Discovery, by contrast, saw a 10% rise.Zazlav also beats Iger when it comes to Abigail Disneys concern over outsized CEO pay compared to that of median employees, with a ratio of 1,511 to 1.A Discovery spokesman said Zaslavs 2018 pay was boosted by a grant of option awards tied to a contract extension.Its really a five-year grant that got counted last year, he said.
New York on the verge of higher gas prices:::::Big Apple gasoline prices are headed upward for warmer weather and the vacation season.A gallon of regular is hovering at $3 in the city, after climbing from a 2019 low of about $2.50 in February, said price-tracking service GasBuddy.com.Costs climb in the spring as filling stations switch to summer-blend gas, which is more expensive to produce, according to the American Automobile Association.New Yorks price fluctuations mirror those of the rest of the country, but city residents pay roughly 20 to 30 cents more per gallon than the national average, according to GasBuddy.
New Jersey really needs to rethink its legal weed tax:::::A while back, I wrote that New Jerseys proposed tax on marijuana sales at $42 an ounce was too high and I predicted that would result in people buying cheaper black-market pot.People wrote to me to say I was nuts because consumers would want the better quality pot that was being sold by legally sanctioned distributors.Well, New Jersey has delayed pot sales.But Canada, where recreational marijuana has been legalized, is confirming that what I suggested about the weed business is true.Legal pot in Canada is 57 percent more expensive than the stuff sold by street dealers.As a result, the government reports that $5 billion worth of pot was purchased on the black market and only $2 billion from legal dealers since legalization took place.New Jersey had better rethink its tax policy before it legalizes marijuana or the drug dealers are the only ones who are going to make out.It would also be nice if Jersey didnt stall the sale of medical marijuana just because its having trouble passing a law to allow recreational pot.The price of bitcoin has risen sharply recently and nobody seems to know why.One possibility is that someone is aggressively buying the coins, according to reports.Another reason given was an April Fools story about bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) being approved.Another explanation was that there is no explanation.As Ive said before, bitcoin is a bit-con.Its a Ponzi scheme.Its now selling for around $5,300 a coin, down from more than $17,000 when I started to pick on it.You might want to think twice or even three times before getting involved with this asset.
Bed Bath & Beyond’s board overhaul fails to please hedge funds:::::Bed Bath & Beyonds splashy announcement of a board overhaul on Monday failed to boost the stock or ward off a looming proxy battle by a trio of angry hedge funds.The retail chains stock sank 4% on Monday after it announced a transformation of its board, including five new independent directors and the resignation of two co-founders as chairmen of the board.The retailer said it made the changes in response to shareholder feedback, including three hedge funds that have called for an entirely new board and the ouster of the CEO.But the hedge funds, which together control 5% of the companys stock, quickly pooh-poohed the companys slate, saying its candidates lack the experience needed to turn the retailer around.The board changes announced today by Bed Bath are not nearly enough when measured against what is needed to address issues with the current board and management, hedge fund Legion Partners said Monday in a joint statement with Macellum Advisors and Ancora Advisors.We will therefore continue to move forward with our campaign to install fresh, experienced and independent oversight and management at the company.Bed Bath and Beyonds stock was down a whopping 55% over the last two years on seven quarters of same-store sales declines when the hedge fund group announced its overhaul plans last month.The stock is still down 5.6% over the last 12 months including the 22% pop in the stock on March 26, the day the hedge fund group surfaced.Loop Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba called Bed Bath & Beyonds move drastic but badly timed.From the activist [investor] perspective, its too little too late, he said.Indeed, the hedge fund group has also demanded CEO Steven Temares be replaced, calling him richly rewarded despite the companys chronic underperformance, including $51 million in total compensation between 2015 and 2017.On Monday, they blasted Bed Bath & Beyond for leaving Temares in place, saying he must be held accountable for the companys prolonged poor performance and destruction of shareholder value.The group has criticized the company for having lost touch with modern retail, including its dizzying array of too similar items in stores.They are pushing a slate of 16 candidates, including former Gap CEO Jeff Kirwan and former Pier 1 Imports CEO Alexander Smith, to replace the entire board.Analyst Chukumba on Monday agreed that the company has been slow to adopt to changing consumer habits.Merchandising has deteriorated, he said, referring to the stores hodgepodge of as-seen-on-TV wares that cheapen the customer experience.Bed Bath and Beyond said it new 10-member board, including Ann Yerger of the Council of Institutional Investors nonprofit, will give the board 9 out of 10 independent directors, with the CEO being the 10th director.The new board will also form a business transformation and strategy review committee to review all aspects of the companys business transformation, strategy and structure, the company said.Bed Bath and Beyond declined to comment.
Teen’s $1B suit claims Apple’s facial recognition software led to false arrest:::::Hes trying to save face.A New York man filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Apple, claiming the tech giants facial-recognition software wrongly blamed him for stealing from Apple stores.Ousmane Bah, 18, claims someone used a stolen ID to pass themselves off as him when they were busted stealing $1,200 worth of merchandise from an Apple store in Boston on May 31, 2018, according to papers filed in Manhattan federal court.The ID listed his name, address and other personal information but did not include a photo.Bah believes Apple took the perp at his word, and then programmed its security systems to recognize the mans face as Bahs.The thief then ripped off Apple stores in New Jersey, Delaware and Manhattan incidents Bah was blamed for, the suit claims.He only learned about the mix-up after receiving a Boston municipal court summons in the mail in June, according to court papers.The NYPD arrested him on Nov. 29, but a detective working the case viewed surveillance footage from the Manhattan store and concluded that the suspect looked nothing like Bah, his lawsuit states.Charges against Bah have been dropped in every state except New Jersey, where the case is still pending.Apples use of facial recognition software in its stores to track individuals suspected of theft is the type of Orwellian surveillance that consumers fear, particularly as it can be assumed that the majority of consumers are not aware that their faces are secretly being analyzed, the lawsuit states.Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
Tesla dispatches team to probe video of Model S exploding in China:::::US electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc. said it has sent a team to investigate a video on Chinese social media that showed a parked Tesla Model S exploding, the latest in a string of fire incidents involving its cars.The video, time-stamped Sunday evening and widely shared on Chinas Twitter-like Weibo, shows the parked EV emit smoke and burst into flames seconds later.A video purportedly of the aftermath showed a line of three cars destroyed.Shares of Tesla were down less than 2 percent at $268.5 in trading before the bell.Reuters was not immediately able to verify the origins of the videos, which Weibo users said were taken in Shanghai.The cause of the explosion could not immediately be ascertained from the videos.We immediately sent a team on site and were supporting local authorities to establish the facts.From what we know now, no one was harmed, Tesla said in a statement Monday.It declined further comment when contacted by Reuters.
Warren Buffett-backed Kraft Heinz eyes turnaround with new CEO:::::Kraft Heinz Co named Miguel Patricio as its next chief executive on Monday, hoping the 30-year marketing veteran will revitalize brands such as Planters nuts and Oscar Mayer bacon at one of the worlds largest packaged food companies.Patricio, a 52-year-old native of Portugal, will take over the top job in July after two decades at Anheuser-Busch InBev, where he rose to become the companys global head of marketing, building sales of beer brands Corona, Budweiser and others.Before AB InBev, Patricio worked at major consumer companies including Philip Morris, Coca-Cola Co and Johnson & Johnson.He succeeds Bernardo Hees, 49, who was made CEO in 2015 when Kraft Foods and H.J.Heinz merged.His appointment comes two months after Kraft Heinz slashed its quarterly dividend, wrote down the value its marquee Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands and other assets by more than $15 billion.It also disclosed that it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Kraft Heinzs second-biggest shareholder, Brazilian private equity fund 3G Capital, has pushed the company to rein in expenses to tackle higher costs and sluggish growth, a strategy it has successfully implemented at holdings including Heinz and Anheuser-Busch.Great companies are the ones that have the costs in control, that grow the top line, and grow the bottom line its not one or the other, Patricio said in an interview.I have very good experience on that on being more efficient every year, which doesnt mean cutting costs.It means to be more efficient.Krafts cost cuts, made at the urging of 3G, resulted in smaller marketing and advertising budgets for key brands like Oscar Mayer bacon and the loss of brand managers, which translated to market share loss to cheaper, private-label competitors, according to two former Kraft Heinz marketing employees.On top of that, the broad sector has struggled with rising transportation and commodity costs along with a shift in consumer preferences to more niche health-focused brands.Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway Inc and 3G together own close to 50 percent of Kraft Heinz.Berkshire Hathaway did not immediately response to requests for comment.The company also disclosed in February that it had been subpoenaed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to an investigation into its accounting policies, procedures and internal controls related to procurement.At the time, Kraft said it was working on ways to improve its internal controls and determined the problems required it to record a $25 million increase to the cost of products sold.The change at the top of Kraft Heinz is a positive development, said Roosevelt Investment Group fund manager Jason Benowitz, which previously held a stake in Kraft Heinz.It shows that management and the board understand the serious nature of the challenges facing the company.Kraft Heinz cannot further cost cut its way to prosperity.The companys shares were flat at $32.96.The stock has lost half its value since Heinz and Kraft merged.
2019 New York International Auto Show: The hottest rides:::::At the 2019 New York International Auto Show taking place at the Javits Center through Sunday car shoppers can check out the latest from Toyota, Lincoln and Hyundai, among others .But theres plenty of fun to be had even if youre not in the market: among the nearly 1,000 vehicles on display are some unfathomably fast supercars, breathtakingly expensive beauties and crazy-cool tech.Here are some of the most dazzling stars of the show.Flat-out fastest: When it was reported that Swedish automaker Koenigsegg might finally take part in the 24-hour Le Mans race in 2020, car geeks freaked out.After all, these are some of the fastest speedsters in the world.Making its North American debut at the New York International Auto Show, the brands Jesko a hypercar, meaning it boasts ultra-light construction (in this case, a carbon-fiber chassis) is said to be capable of 300 mph.Powered by a twin-turbocharged V8 engine that cranks out 1600 horsepower, its equipped with an unusual nine-speed, seven-clutch gearbox.The brainchild behind the $3 million Jesko is Christian von Koenigsegg, who went from washing cars to producing them.And he has already sold out the entire 125-edition limited run of his latest.Best bells & whistles: Mercedes-Benz is introducing its 2020 GLC300 Coupe at the show, and the crossover SUV is tricked out with a plethora of high-tech toys.The new MBUX telematics system is a personal assistant that responds to the prompt, Hey Mercedes.Among the features it can control: a 10.2-inch touchscreen and an optional 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster.Thanks to artificial intelligence, the car can learn where you want to go and what songs you want to hear.MBUX also lets you choose control modes Comfort offers better suspension; Sport, more direct engine response just like in a video game.Heftiest price tag: Bugatti dropped jaws when the company sold the one-off prototype La Voiture Noire for $19 million at the Geneva Motor Show in March.That stunner wont be making the trip to New York, but the Chiron Sport 110 ans Bugatti will likely be the most expensive car at the show with a whopping asking price of $3.745 million.All 20 limited-edition coupes have already been snapped up.Its a tribute to the 110-year-old automakers foundation in France, with the colors of that nations flag (blue for liberty, white for equality and red for fraternity) highlighted on the hyerpcars wing mirrors seatbacks and exterior trim.Wildest peek at the future: While many automakers no longer bother with dazzling concept cars, Volkswagen is delivering big, fun ideas with its battery-powered I.D.Buggy Concept.The retro-futuristic design, shown in neon green, recalls a 1960s California dune buggy, complete with no roof, no doors but it does have weatherproof seats and even water drains.A 62.0-kWh battery pack gives the rear-wheel-drive machine 155 miles of electric range.And its customizable: You can add extra seats and even switch out the body.Who knows if the beach buggy will ever make it to production, but its sure fun to imagine especially since VWs in the last year of making its iconic Beetle.
Stop & Shop execs reach agreement after Biden-backed employee strikes:::::BOSTON Stop & Shop supermarket workers and company officials reached a tentative contract agreement Sunday that includes wage increases for all associates and maintains health coverage, according to news releases from both parties.The company said the agreement ends employee strikes that started April 11 at 240 Stop & Shop stores in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut.The tentative three-year agreement with the United Food and Commercial Workers union is subject to ratification votes by members of each of the union locals, the company said.Our associates top priority will be restocking our stores so we can return to taking care of our customers and communities and providing them with the service they deserve, the company said.We deeply appreciate the patience and understanding of our customers during this time, and we look forward to welcoming them back to Stop & Shop.The union said today is a powerful victory for the 31,000 hardworking men and women of Stop & Shop who courageously stood up to fight for what all New Englanders want.It said workers were on strike to protest the companys proposed cuts to health care, take-home pay and other benefits.Under this proposed contract, our members will be able to focus on continuing to help customers in our communities enjoy the best shopping experience possible and to keep Stop & Shop the number one grocery store in New England, the union said.The agreement preserves health care and retirement benefits, provides wage increases, and maintains time-and-a-half pay on Sunday for current members.The company limited its offerings amid the strikes.Stop & Shop President Mark McGowan said in a letter April 16 that most stores would remain open for 12 hours, seven days a week.However, he said bakery, customer service, deli, seafood counters and gas stations would not be operational.The limited offerings impacted Passover shopping in New England, as Stop & Shop is the regions largest supermarket chain and has deep roots in the local Jewish community.A number of rabbis in Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island advised their congregations not to cross picket lines to buy Jewish holiday essentials.The food that youre buying is the product of oppressed labor and thats not kosher, Rabbi Barbara Penzner, of Temple Hillel Bnai Torah, a reconstructionist synagogue in Boston, said last week.Especially during Passover, when were celebrating freedom from slavery, thats particularly egregious.Stop & Shop is a subsidiary of Dutch supermarket giant Ahold Delhaize, with 415 stores across the Northeast.Workers at company stores in New York and New Jersey were not on strike.Multiple public figures came out in support of the workers.Democratic presidential candidate and US Sen. Elizabeth Warren stood on a picket line April 12 in Somerville, Massachusetts, saying she would fight for the dignity of working people.Connecticut Lt. Gov.Susan Bysiewicz and US Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, supported Stop & Shop employees in Connecticut.Former Vice President and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden met with workers outside a store in Bostons Dorchester neighborhood.Two more Democratic 2020 candidates, South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and US Sen. Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, visited stores in support of the workers as well.A former NHL player for the Boston Bruins and Colorado Avalanche, defenseman Ray Bourque, was caught in the middle of the strike when he was seen crossing a picket line to shop at a Massachusetts store.Bourque apologized for crossing the line and promised to walk the picket line in solidarity with Stop & Shop workers once his medical issue was resolved.
‘Walmart of liquor’ fighting for store in Westchester County:::::An epic battle over cheap booze is coming to a head in Westchester County and its slated to land in court next month.Total Wine & More a fast-growing chain of nearly 200 stores across 23 states thats been branded by critics as a ruthless Walmart of liquor is appealing a decision by the New York State Liquor Authority to reject its application for a 21,000-square-foot store near White Plains.The case is being closely watched by booze sellers in New York City, who fear that Total Wines rock-bottom pricing could threaten their business across the five boroughs if the company prevails, sources said.A 750-ml bottle of Makers Mark bourbon costs $23.99 at Total Wines store in Westbury, LI its only store in New York compared with $35.99 at Zachys, a popular store in Scarsdale.A 1.75-liter jug of Tanqueray gin sells for $34.99 at Total versus $48.99 at Zachys.In a decision last December that followed opposition letters from 25 state lawmakers and a raucous, three-hour hearing, the state liquor board ruled that Westchester is adequately served and arguably oversaturated with liquor shops.Total Wines Bethesda, Md.-based owners Robert and David Trone the latter of whom got elected to US Congress last year as a Democrat campaigning for criminal-justice reform had argued that the opposition to their mega-store was anti-competitive and politically motivated.Total Wine is appealing the decision, and a hearing is scheduled in New York state Supreme Court on May 10.The 28-year-old company, whose revenue is estimated at $3 billion, has achieved dramatic results in similar skirmishes with local officials.Thanks to battles with Total Wine, Minnesota as of 2017 allows alcohol sales on Sunday, while Connecticut liquor stores can now stay open until 10 p.m. an hour later than they were allowed until 2015.In South Carolina, liquor store owners can now operate more than three stores because of Total Wine, which got the law changed in 2017.Nevertheless, the level and manner in which the opposition was activated in New York was unprecedented for Total Wine, according to a source close to the situation.After Total Wine opened its first and only New York store in Westbury in 2017, it applied to open another store about 30 miles away, in Stony Brook.The state liquor board denied its license, stating that it was too close to the first store.At a 2017 hearing over the proposed Stony Brook store, the Metropolitan Package Store Association rallied mom-and-pop proprietors from across the state, many of whom were brought to the hearing on chartered buses, Robert Trone griped in a March affidavit.Protesters outside the state liquor boards Harlem office were chanting and playing loud music, according to a source at the meeting.When Total Wines Stony Brook application got rejected, they erupted into a rowdy celebration as they loaded cases of cold beer onto their buses home, witnesses said.The Metropolitan Package Store Association didnt respond to requests for comment.This is an industry thats designed legislatively for the small, mom-and-pop business, liquor license attorney Robert Bookman told The Post.As they gird for next months court hearing, local liquor mongers confirm that they believe theyre in for the fight of their life.They put other stores out of business by lowering their prices, and when [the smaller stores] go out of business they jack up their prices, said Stefan Kalagridis, president of the New York State Liquor Store Association, who also owns Colvin Wine Merchants in Albany.Kalagridis couldnt name specific examples of Total Wine competitors that have shuttered, however.Total Wine declined to comment for this story.Its officials have said at public hearings there is no evidence competitors have folded after it opens a store nearby.
Merrill Lynch bolstering its ranks of financial advisers:::::Just when many on Wall Street thought Merrill Lynchs thundering herd of financial advisers were a thing of the past, the Bank of America wealth management arm is hiring hundreds, and ratcheting up plans to enlarge its branch network in Manhattan and the outer boroughs.The thundering herd will be growing in and around New York City, Andy Sieg, head of the BofA global wealth and investment management unit, told The Post, citing the banks recent big investments, upgrades and additional space on six floors at 75 Rockefeller Plaza as an encouraging sign.Sieg was speaking in the wake of the units quarterly earnings, the best on record with $1.05 billion in net income a 4% or $127 million year-over-year increase.Productivity is also up for Merrills advisers for generations, fondly nicknamed the thundering herd and has soared past the much revered $1 million mark, hitting $1.35 million in the latest quarter.Its evidence that Merrill brokers are pulling in client money and new accounts at breakneck speed.By several metrics, Merrill is the leading wirehouse in America, with client balances also surging to $2.8 trillion, up 8%, in the past 12 months.New rounds of hires will help fuel further growth, based on asset gathering and cross-selling opportunities, analysts say.Merrills headcount is now close to 15,000 traditional financial advisers, not including its 2,700 financial solutions advisers (FSAs) and thousands more in affiliated private banking.Sieg said that despite the huge investments Merrill continues to make in brokerage technology, apps, electronic tools and robo platforms, the wirehouse expects to see its roster of human advisers expand by leaps and bounds.Many more traditional advisers as well as FSAs will be recruited for net gains, he said.Although no specific plans are confirmed for branch openings and expansions in New York City, Sieg hinted that new ground troops will be urgently needed to service and advise clients.Client acquisitions today are running at 10 times the pace of five to 10 years ago, he said, referring to new business.Merrill currently has 3,500 adviser trainees as it targets a 1% annual growth in its adviser ranks.And by this years end, the brokerage giant is on pace to add 300 FSAs to its existing pool, many of whom are located at Bank of America branches.In a new twist, these latest FSA hires will work alongside FAs at Merrill Lynch.In no way are we diminishing the role of technology to service clients in a high-quality way, Sieg added.But there have been so many column inches written about technology in our business I thought it was time for a little reset to ensure we have the best, most diverse and most highly trained advisers to serve our clients.Analysts say the full-throttle campaign unveiled by Sieg to The Post could help consolidate Merrills firm grip as the biggest wealth management player.And it raises the stakes for rivals like Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and JP Morgan, they added.Sieg said Merrill FAs and wealth management professionals are in a sweet spot as history unfolds.This is an exciting time for the financial advisers at Merrill Lynch, because they can now deliver all the capabilities from across Bank of America, he said.
New Yorkers last to hit tax freedom:::::The Empire State has become a tax hell for many, with some New Yorkers looking for the exits.Thats because this year the state is once again the most taxing in the nation, a new study says.To demonstrate the draconian burden New Yorkers have to endure, the Tax Foundation, in its new study, found that Tax Freedom Day will arrive here the latest of any state May 3.Thats almost three weeks later than the national average of April 16.Tax Freedom Day is the number of working days each year it takes the average American to earn the money to pay his or her tax bill.There are several reasons New Yorkers are the last to reach tax freedom.New Yorks tax burden is incredible, said Garrett Watson, special projects manager with the Tax Foundation.Some of it is a high state tax.Some is a city tax combined with a state tax.Some is the effect of federal policies.But the Tax Foundation said the result is the same: The average New Yorkers state and local tax burden per capita is $8,957, compared with $4,946 in the rest of the country, according to the Tax Foundations State Business Tax Climate Index study.This comes as many New Yorkers must also pay more in federal taxes because of the new tax code.It creates a vicious cycle, Watson said.Gov.Cuomo, Mayor de Blasio, state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and state Senate Finance Committee Chairwoman Liz Krueger all declined to comment.
Student debt is the real killer:::::Tis the season when kids across America make the decision to commit to a college.It should be a very exciting time in a 17-year-olds life.But it places daunting financial pressure on families and the kids themselves.The student loan crisis that was born out of the stupidity of Washington should be ended by Washington, once and for all.Student/family loans currently stand at $1.5 trillion, crippling the future of todays students and the future of our economy.The Green New Deal and free health care for all are just political hyperbole and dishonest drama.I can promise you the world will not end in 12 years because the Green New Deal didnt pass.And I can also promise you there will be a student loan crisis within the next dozen years.Its already here for many, and that was preventable there was $616,525,591,000 sitting in college endowments at the end of 2018.I think we all can agree that something is severely wrong with a system in which families and kids go into debt while universities are counting their billions.These schools operate under the false shield of not for profit.In fact, its all about profits.Endowment chairs turned petulant when in the 2017 tax law their profits were subject to a 1 percent tax for the first time ever.College may not be for everyone, but everyone should have the option to attend college if she wants.And colleges arent granted not-for-profit status so they can compare endowments to see whose is bigger or performs better.Lets redistribute tuition from the rich endowments and give to the poor and overextended students.And lets be quick about it: A five-year wind-down of all college and university endowments over $250 million with the money going to reduce national student and family college debt across the country.College doesnt need to be free for all, because thats just a tax-and-spend scam.But it shouldnt be free for universities to hoard their billions under the worlds largest tax scandal, either.
The government needs to double down on Chinese counterfeits:::::Dear John: I enjoyed your reporting about Juul cigarettes being counterfeited by the Chinese.But never mind Juul.Check out how the Chinese are making US postage stamps worth billions.There is no bar code on them and they are sold all over the US.No wonder the US Postal Service is losing billions.There is no way to check if the stamps you buy are really from the post office.D.A.Dear D.A.: Ive written a number of times about fake postage stamps.A source of mine even offered to show US postal inspectors where they were being made in New York City.They werent interested.I hadnt heard about the Chinese making counterfeit stamps, but that wouldnt surprise me.If you can make fake Juul e-cigarettes and the cartridges, you can certainly print stamps.As I said in the column you are referring to, the US government is going to have to stop the Chinese from stealing intellectual property and counterfeiting goods if it is ever going to have an effective trade deal.And its going to be tough for the Chinese government to stop the counterfeiters.This is big business over there.Dear John: My problem deals with Verizon FiOS billing.For the first year, the promotional price for phone/internet/TV was around $93, with two movie channels.When the year ended last October, the price jumped to about $130.I have basic TV, no movie channels or any premiums.I dont do spread sheets, tax returns or any intricate things on the internet, which is the slowest at 50/50.I was also told that I was bumped up to 100/100, but my billing still shows the 50/50.I have spoken to Verizon reps monthly to see if they have better deals.In January I spoke to a gentleman at FiOS who looked over my account and told me my bill will be $102 going forward.Februarys bill came and it was the same $130.So I called again, and spoke to another guy, who again went through the same checking.And he said he did see my January call and that I was supposed to get the new rate.He also went through half an hours worth of checking and also told me that my billing will come to $102, including taxes, through October 2019.Again, the March bill came to the same $130.Yesterday I spoke to Vicky, who checked everything again, saw the two previous calls (they are taped) and told me that nothing was ever put through.Plus the fact that I will lose another one of their discounts in October.These are reps of Verizon do I have any recourse?Its time they gave us seniors a break.S.K.Dear S.K.: As you know, I contacted Verizon, and I think this matter has been resolved.You are telling me that you will now pay $116 a month.Thats not as good as the $102 you were promised, but your new deal supposedly includes extended discounts.Hey, if youre happy, then Im happy.But you should have quibbled the price down to $102 a month.
Giving the haters a dose of truth on immigration:::::Dear John: You come from Italian immigrants, you hateful man.How can you support President Trump, a bigot who is ruining this country?Are you also a pathological liar?Shame on you and your ancestors!R.H. Dear R.H.: I like getting an e-mail from the nutty fringe every once in a while.Lets start with my ancestors.They came from Italy and got into the US legally.Let me repeat the key word legally.Now lets get to my opinion of Trump and his immigration policy.I think Trump is absolutely correct in keeping people from entering this country illegally.Illegal immigration to put it simply for a person like you is illegal.And the laws should be obeyed.But Im very much in favor of legal immigration, as Ive written many times before.Not only do I favor it, but I think that this countrys financial woes Social Security, Medicare, budget deficits and debt cant be overcome unless we have a growing workforce that includes an influx of immigrants.So why not grow up and stop the name-calling?You signed this Rude Hombre, but rudeness is the least of your failings.And, by the way, I can be as rude as the next person when antagonized.
Victoria’s Secret’s biggest problem may be L Brands leadership:::::L Brands, the owner behind the struggling Victorias Secret brand, needs to do more than reshuffle a few board seats to convince investors its ready for a comeback, critics say.L Brands said late Thursday that it will add two new independent directors to the companys board following criticisms that the previous 12-person board had been largely comprised of cronies of founder Les Wexner.But the stock barely moved on the news in late trading and critics continue to say the biggest problem is Wexner himself.L Brands needs the type of CEO that understands retail today and the possibility of retail, Eleanor Bloxham, corporate-governance adviser with Value Alliance, told The Post.The culture wont change until he has a more passive role, retail consultant Gabriella Santaniello of A Line Partners told The Post of Wexner, credited as the man behind the famous Victorias Secret Angels.Indeed, sales have been stagnant for years as Victorias Secret and its Angels once the epitome of female sexiness have struggled to remain relevant.The companys overly padded bras and bejeweled underwear now compete with a trend toward more natural undergarments embraced by newer lingerie brands such as ThirdLove and Adore Me.The stock plunged 28.6 percent over the last year as traffic to Victorias Secret US stores fall.In addition to nominating two women to its board, L Brands agreed to de-stagger its board by 2021 further eroding Wexners grip.It will also make New York hedge fund Barington Capital, which has called for Wexner to give up his dual titles as chairman and chief executive officer, a special adviser to the company.Barington blasted the company in March for its largely male, entrenched board, many of whom have strong ties to Wexner, including his wife, Abigail, and his longtime business adviser Dennis Hersch.L Brands declined to say which two directors will be removed to make way for the two new directors, Anne Sheehan, formerly with the California State Teachers Retirement System, and Sarah Nash of manufacturing company Novagard Solutions.The two new board members give L Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works, a board that is 40-percent female.
Brands are rolling with 4/20 as pot legalization grows:::::LOS ANGELES Potheads have for decades celebrated their love of marijuana on April 20, but the once counterculture celebration that was all about getting stoned now is so mainstream, corporate America is starting to embrace it.No, Hallmark doesnt yet have a card to mark 420.But many other businesses inside and outside the multibillion-dollar cannabis industry are using April 20, or 4/20, to roll out marketing and social media messaging aimed at connecting with consumers driving the booming market.On Saturday, Lyft is offering a $4.20 credit on a single ride in Colorado and in select cities in the US and Canada.Carls Jr. is using a Denver restaurant to market a hamburger infused with CBD, a non-intoxicating molecule found in cannabis that many believe is beneficial to their health.On 420 last year, Totinos, a maker of frozen pizza snacks, tweeted an image of a microwave and an oven with the message: To be blunt, pizza rolls are better when baked.I think brands that associate themselves with cannabis kind of get that contact high.In other words, theyre just considered to be cooler by association, said Kit Yarrow, consumer psychologist at Golden Gate University.As pot becomes more legal, more discussed, more interesting to people, more widely used, then 420 becomes more mainstream as well.Marijuana normalization has snowballed since 2012, when Colorado and Washington were the first states to legalize recreational use.Eight more followed, including California, Oregon and Michigan.Medical marijuana is legal in two-thirds of the states, with conservative-leaning Utah and Oklahoma among recent additions.Meantime, the CBD market has exploded.CBD oil can be found in candies, coffee and other food, drinks and dietary supplements, along with perfume, lotions, creams and soap.Proponents say CBD helps with pain, anxiety and inflammation, though limited scientific research supports those claims.US retail sales of cannabis products jumped to $10.5 billion last year, a threefold increase from 2017, according to data from Arcview Group, a cannabis investment and market research firm.The figures do not include retail sales of hemp-derived CBD products.Ben & Jerrys was one of the earliest big brands to foster a connection with the marijuana culture through marketing.The Vermont-based ice cream company features Cherry Garcia and Phish Food, honoring late Grateful Dead member Jerry Garcia and the band Phish.Both bands are favorites of the marijuana-smoking crowd.To mark 420 in recent years, Ben & Jerrys debuted taco- and burrito-inspired ice cream sandwiches.This year the company partnered with a San Francisco Bay Area cannabis retailer to give customers who place delivery orders on Friday and Saturday a free pint of Half Baked, a combination of cookie dough and fudge brownie.We have a lot of fun, never being overt, but really playing into the moment of 420, said Jay Curley, the companys global head of integrated marketing.Last year, Ben & Jerrys also turned more serious, asking consumers to call on lawmakers to expunge prior marijuana convictions and press for pardons or amnesty for anyone arrested for smoking pot.This year the company is using the holiday to call for criminal justice reform.Were actually using this as an opportunity not to tell a stoner joke like we have in the past, but to raise what we see as a much more serious issue around justice, Curley said.Those in the marijuana marketplace also are ramping up advertising around 420.Much of the marketing about cannabis or related products takes the form of online ads, emails, text messages and social media.Shops typically offer discounts.Some host parties with food and entertainment.The larger 420 events can draw thousands of people.Verano Holdings, whose businesses include cannabis shops, sponsors street festivals in Chicago and Tulsa, Oklahoma, where attendees can learn about marijuana products, listen to music and grab a bite.The company expects this Saturdays festival in Chicago, going on its third year, will draw more than 4,000 people.Last year, it drew 1,500, said Tim Tennant, Veranos chief marketing officer.In San Franciscos Golden Gate Park, Hippie Hill will again be the site of a 420 celebration.Last year, more than 15,000 attended the event, which has transformed from a small informal gathering into a full-blown festival of corporate sponsors and commercial booths selling smoking devices, T-shirts and food.Roger Volodarsky, whose Los Angeles-based Puffco makes portable vaporizers, has celebrated 420 since he was a teenager.Back then, he said, 420 was the day that you splurged on yourself and got high in interesting ways.It was the day that you made a gravity bong and coughed your brains out.Volodarksy likes that some Main Street brands are getting into the industry and the holiday.Whats important to me about these ad campaigns is theyre speaking to people who arent users and theyre normalizing the space to people who arent users, he said.Even as popularity grows, some companies will stay away from 420 as a marketing tool, said Allen Adamson, co-founder of Metaforce, a marketing consulting company.If youre talking about a big brand that needs to appeal to everybody and is very risk-averse, then probably not, he said.I dont think youll see large financial institutions doing it.
FTC eyes personal punishment for Mark Zuckerberg over privacy:::::The Federal Trade Commission is mulling ways to hold Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible for Facebooks privacy lapses, including fines that would ding the CEOs own wallet, according to a new report.The watchdog, which started probing Facebook last year over data breaches tied to the 2016 presidential election, is looking at the 34-year-old billionaires past statements on privacy to see whether increased government oversight over his leadership is warranted, according to The Washington Post.In an appearance before Congress last year, Zuckerberg said that he is responsible for what happens at Facebook due to his position as founder and CEO.The report said that the FTC is considering fining Zuckerberg personally in order to send a message to other big companies in Silicon Valley that their days of playing it fast and loose with user data are numbered.Another possible plan would see Zuckerberg and other executives regularly certifying the social networks privacy practices to its board, according to the report.The FTC declined to comment when contacted by The Post.Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.The FTC opened its probe in March 2018 following reports showing Trump campaign-affiliated research firm Cambridge Analytica was able to hoover up the personal data of nearly 90 million Facebook users to better target them with political ads.The investigation seeks to determine whether Facebook violated the terms of a 2011 consent decree it signed with the FTC, which restricted the ways it could share users personal data.The two sides have been reportedly close to a settlement for months, including negotiations over a record multibillion dollar fine.The FBI, SEC and Justice Department also joined the probe last July.Facebook and FTC reached the 2011 settlement after the agency accused the social network of deceiving its users by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made public, the FTC said at the time.Among other things, Facebook had told users that third-party apps on its site wouldnt be able to access their data.Nevertheless, the apps got access to almost all of their personal information, according to the FTC.
Trump deregulations coming for frozen cherry pies:::::President Donald Trump may soon be able to claim a sweet victory for his deregulation push, with officials preparing to get rid of the decades-old rules for frozen cherry pies.Emails show the Food and Drug Administration planned to start the process for revoking the standard for frozen cherry pies this week, followed by a similar revocation of the standard for French dressing.Plans to get rid of the obscure rules had been tucked into the Trump administrations deregulation agenda.Standards for an array of foods including cottage cheese and canned peas were put in place decades ago partly to ensure a level of quality.They spell out how products with specific names can be made, including ingredients that are required or not allowed.The rules for frozen cherry pies say they must be 25% cherries by weight with no more than 15% of the cherries being blemished.Its not always clear why some food terms have standards and others dont.The rules are seen as arcane by many and are a sore spot in the food industry, with companies saying they prevent innovation or prompt lawsuits.The FDA under Trump has said it plans to update the standards.Lee Sanders of the American Bakers Association said shes hopeful the cherry pie standard will finally be revoked, but that it would not make a big difference for the industry.I feel confident our members are producing cherry pies with more than enough cherries, she said.The FDA also plans to take another look at milk, which federal regulations define as coming from a cow.The dairy industry has called for a crackdown on soy, rice and almond drinks makers that use the term.While any changes to the milk rule are likely to be contested, getting rid of the standard for frozen cherry pie is unlikely to be controversial.The frozen cherry pie standard is an outlier because other fruit pies dont have similar rules.The same is true for French dressing: The Association for Dressings and Sauces, which once went after a vegan spread for violating the mayonnaise standard, notes other dressings are not subject to such standards.Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who stepped down this month, said in an October tweet that it was among the FDAs priorities to de-regulate frozen cherry pie.He apparently wasnt entirely joking.In a June email, the FDA noted plans to post a proposal to revoke the frozen cherry pie standard on April 18.It said the proposal to revoke the French dressing standard would be posted May 3.In a statement this week, the FDA said the dates were for long range internal planning purposes and that the timing could shift.Updates to the standards will be publicly noted, the agency said.
Canopy Growth agrees to buy Acreage Holdings in $3.4B deal:::::Canopy Growth has agreed to roll up one of the biggest US marijuana growers in a $3.4 billion deal.However, the companies said Thursday that Canopys acquisition of NY-based Acreage Holdings is contingent upon cannabis production and sales becoming legal at a federal level.Canopy hopes to navigate regulatory pitfalls with the influential people Acreage has on its board, including John Boehner, the former speaker of the House of Representatives and William Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts and a Republican presidential candidate.In the deal, Canopy will pay Acreage roughly $300 million in cash up front.If federal legalization happens, Canopy said it would pay Acreage shareholders 0.5818 share in Canopy Growth for each Acreage share held.The companies valued the entire transaction at about $3.4 billion.Acreages stock trading over the counter rose nearly 1% Thursday, to $22.51.Canopy shares jumped 4% Thursday.The stock has gained 72% so far this year.
Dow futures edge higher after US ends all exemptions from Iran oil sanctions:::::U.S. stock index futures were slightly higher Tuesday morning, as market participants await a flurry of corporate earnings.At around 02:00 a.m.ET, Dow futures rose by 23 points, indicating a positive open of more than 27 points.Futures on the S&P and Nasdaq were both seen marginally higher.Oil prices jumped more than 2% in the previous session, hitting their highest level this year amid intensifying concern about global supplies.It comes after the U.S. announced a further clampdown on Iran's oil exports.The world's largest economy said Monday that from May 1, it would eliminate all waivers allowing eight economies to buy Iranian oil without facing U.S. sanctions.International benchmark Brent crude traded at $74.40 Tuesday morning, up around 0.5%, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at $65.93, almost 0.6% higher.
Facebook hires top State Department lawyer as general counsel:::::Facebook announced on Monday that it's bringing in a new general counsel and vice president of communications as it tries to rebuild its image following a year filled with scandals.The company said Jennifer Newstead, the legal adviser to the U.S. State Department, is joining the company as its general counsel, replacing Colin Stretch, who said last year that he would be departing.Facebook also named John Pinette as vice president of global communications, succeeding Caryn Marooney, who announced her plans to leave in February.Newstead, who was confirmed by the Senate in December 2017, is a government veteran, having previously worked at the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Justice and as an associate White House counsel.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo thanked Newstead for her service in a statement, without addressing where she was going.
Luckin Coffee files for US IPO:::::China's Luckin Coffee on Monday filed for an initial public offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.The coffee chain, which intends to list under the symbol "LK" on the Nasdaq, set a placeholder amount of $100 million to indicate the size of the IPO, a filing with the regulator showed.The size of the IPO stated in preliminary filings is used to calculate registration fees.The final IPO size could be different.
Kraft Heinz's CEO is the latest victim of Big Food’s exodus of leaders:::::Kraft Heinz's Bernardo Hees is the latest CEO to announce his exit from a food company, as the industry goes through unprecedented turnover and challenges.The parade of departures includes Kellogg's John Bryant, Mondelez International's Irene Rosenfeld and Campbell Soup's Denise Morrison.When Morrison left last May, she capped a streak of 15 CEO departures since the beginning of 2016.The longest-tenured food company CEO is Joe Sanderson, the third-generation leader of poultry company Sanderson Farms.Irwin Simon, the founder and chief of Hain Celestial Group, had been the second-longest tenured CEO when he left in June.Simon, who held the top job at the natural foods company since 1993, stepped down as the company came under activist pressure.Now, Sean Connolly, Conagra's CEO, holds that title.He joined the company in 2015.The CEO merry-go-round underscores the challenges iconic food brands are facing.These grocery store staples are struggling to create growth in the face of upstart rivals, rapidly changing consumer trends and their own slower-paced cultures.If they want to buy growth, there are limited and expensive options.These executives are also victims of their predecessors' successes.The scale that once gave CEOs power at the grocery store and yielded cost savings now makes it harder to casually shift away from legacy businesses.Campbell could cut down on soup production and Kellogg its cereal business, but both would still have the fixed costs associated with these businesses.It is, therefore, a challenge for a CEO to gather support from a company to shift its focus from namesake moneymakers to bet on growth.That's even in the face of packaged food company sales slowing last year to 1.2%, according to Euromonitor.
Top auto executives are privately very worried about the state of auto sales:::::Hollis remains upbeat about the industry's chances for 2019, though he also believes sales will drop to 16.8 million or slightly under.But that is far from a crisis, he told CNBC, and reflects a still strong economy, extremely positive consumer confidence levels, and other factors, such as the decision by the Federal Reserve to halt rate hikes, at least for now."I truly believe we'll see a stronger market than what was expected at the beginning of the year," said the U.S. Toyota brand boss.Hollis said, however, there are plenty of external factors out of the industry's control that could send the American market tumbling.And he's far from alone.His own boss, Bob Carter, the head of Toyota's U.S. automotive operations, pointed to the threat of new tariffs on imported autos, something he called "a bad idea for the industry."If President Donald Trump goes ahead with a threatened 25% tariff on foreign-made cars and car parts, analysts have warned, even American-made vehicles could see big price hikes.Toyota previously forecast that would drive up the cost of a Camry sedan assembled in Kentucky by as much as $1,800.But during a conference last week tied to the auto show, Carter revised that estimate and warned the midsize sedan's price could jump by as much as $4,000.For luxury vehicles, such as those made by Toyota's Lexus brand, as well as by Mercedes-Benz and BMW, the increases could run well into five figures.
'Jeopardy' winner James Holzhauer is likely shaking up the game show's budget:::::"Typically, for a long-running show the prize budget is determined by way of averages of what has been won in the past," Bob Boden, former head of programming at Game Show Network, told The Atlantic."James' performance, I'm sure, is causing grief for an accountant somewhere."Oftentimes, shows take out insurance policies.Usually that's reserved for shows with rare but high earnings, such as "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"Boden said he doesn't think "Jeopardy" has the same policy because it usually awards more modest winnings.But even with a successful contestant, game shows' budgets usually allocate more to on-air talent and production crews, said Boden.The Atlantic reported longtime host Alex Trebek's yearly pay is $10 million.There is a lot of buzz around Holzhauer's performance, which could draw in more viewers.That in turn, could boost advertisement sales.Read the full report from The Atlantic here.
Home sales fall 4.9% in slow start to spring buying season:::::Sales of existing U.S. homes fell in March after a huge gain the previous month, held back partly by a sharp slowdown among the most expensive properties.The National Association of Realtors says home sales fell 4.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.21 million, down from 5.48 million in February.The drop followed an 11.2% gain the previous month, the largest in more than three years.
Apple will release a 5G iPhone in 2020 with chips from Qualcomm and Samsung, top analyst says:::::Apple could release iPhones in 2020 equipped with 5G modems, according to research notes from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.The modems could be provided by both Qualcomm and Samsung, according to the research.Access to 5G modem parts is one major reason why Apple settled a bitter legal battle withQualcomm last week.A 5G-equipped iPhone with a faster and more reliable cellular internet connection could give consumers a reason to upgrade from older models as iPhone sales growth stalls.Apple typically releases new iPhone models in September, so the 5G iPhone would not be released until at least September 2020.The iPhones released this September will most likely support current-generation LTE networks instead.From Kuo's note Monday: We expect Apple will likely adopt 5G baseband chips made by Qualcomm (focus on mmWave markets) and Samsung (focus on Sub-6GHz markets) for lowering supply risk, reducing costs and having better bargaining power.Kuo said that the introduction of a 5G iPhone could spur a wave of upgrades and purchases, especially for high-end models:
Beyond Meat looks to raise $183.8 million in its IPO:::::Beyond Meat said Monday it expects its initial public offering to price between $19 and $21 per share, giving the company a market value as high as $1.21 billion.According to its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the El Segundo, California-based company plans to raise $183.8 million through the IPO.Beyond, which manufactures plant-based meat substitutes, plans to list on the Nasdaq Global Market with the ticker BYND.The company, which filed the paperwork for an IPO at the end of March, plans to use the proceeds from going public to invest in current and additional manufacturing facilities, research and development, and sales and marketing.It also plans to use the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes.
Measles nears record in US as the disease spreads in New York:::::Measles has now been confirmed in 22 states, the CDC said.Of the 71 new cases, 68 were in New York, with 53 from New York City and 15 in Rockland County, the agency said.In both areas, health officials have declared public health emergencies and are scrambling to vaccinate people.New York City issued a mandate on April 9 requiring residents in parts of Brooklyn to get vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella or face a $1,000 fine.It also closed a Jewish school that allegedly refused to provide vaccination records.Rockland County and New York City are home to large Orthodox Jewish populations, where some people have refused to vaccinate their children.Jewish Orthodox nurses are trying to debunk misinformation they say people against vaccinations have spread through these communities.For more on investing in health-care innovation, click here to join CNBC at our Healthy Returns Summit in New York City on May 21.Receiving both recommended doses of the MMR vaccine is 97% effective in preventing the measles, according to the CDC.Measles is highly contagious, infecting 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed to the disease, the CDC said.That's why health officials are bracing themselves for an uptick in cases after Passover, a Jewish holiday, ends Saturday.The Food and Drug Administration in a statement Monday reiterated the MMR vaccine is safe and effective."We cannot state strongly enough the overwhelming scientific evidence shows that vaccines are among the most effective and safest interventions to both prevent individual illness and protect public health," Peter Marks, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said.WATCH: What the FDA commissioner wants you to know about the measles vaccine
Disney heiress calls CEO Bob Iger's $65.6 million total compensation 'insane':::::It's not the first time the Disney heiress and philanthropist has criticized CEO pay.In March, Disney stopped short of commenting on Iger's pay in an interview on CNBC's "Squawk Box," but said, "If your CEO salary is at the 700, 600, 500 times your median workers' pay, there is nobody on Earth, Jesus Christ himself isn't worth 500 times his median workers' pay."In a series of tweets Saturday, Disney made clear she is a fan of Iger's although she disagrees with his pay level.A spokesperson for The Walt Disney Company told CNBC, "Mr. Iger's compensation is 90% performance-based and he has delivered exceptional value for shareholders: Disney's market capitalization has grown exponentially over the last decade, rising $75 billion in the last month alone, and the stock price has increased to $132 a share from $24 a share when Mr. Iger became CEO in 2005all of which directly benefits literally thousands of employees who hold our stock."The spokesperson added that the company has invested significantly into employee pay and mobility, including implementing a $15 starting hourly wage at Disneyland and committing $150 million toward a program designed to give hourly workers the opportunity at a college or vocational degree free of charge.Abigail Disney has been outspoken about excessive executive spending and she's put her money where her mouth is, telling The Cut she has given away $70 million since she turned 21.In the interview, she said if it were up to her, "I would pass a law against private jets, because they enable you to get around a certain reality."Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.Watch: The US must make structural changes by taxing the wealthy, says Disney Heiress
Sri Lankan officials shut down Facebook, WhatsApp after bombing:::::In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said, "Our hearts go out to the victims, their families and the community affected by this horrendous act.Teams from across Facebook have been working to support first responders and law enforcement as well as to identify and remove content which violates our standards.We are aware of the government's statement regarding the temporary blocking of social media platforms.People rely on our services to communicate with their loved ones and we are committed to maintaining our services and helping the community and the country during this tragic time."Google, Snap, Viber and the Sri Lankan Embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.Besides cutting off a key form of communication for Sri Lankans in a time of crisis, critics argue that a previous social media ban proved ineffective at quelling violence and misinformation.In March 2018, the Sri Lankan government took a similar measure during a 10-day state of emergency following escalating violence between the country's Muslim and Buddhist communities.An analysis of social media following the 2018 ban by Sri Lanka-based researcher Yudhanjaya Wijeratne found the ban only dropped activity on Facebook down about 50% compared to the three days before the outbreak of violence.People quickly found ways around the ban as searches for "VPN," or virtual private networks, rose after it was announced, according to Wijeratne's analysis.Other research signals that a ban could have even more damaging effects besides simply proving to be ineffective.A 2016 study conducted by Jan Rydzak, associate director of Stanford's Global Digital Policy Incubator, found that following social media shutdowns in India, more violence took place.
Here's everything that has gone wrong for Kraft Heinz in the last year:::::The departure of Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees follows a string of headaches for the consumer packaged foods company over the last year.Shares of Kraft Heinz rose 1.3% in morning trading Monday following the announcement that former Anheuser-Busch InBev executive Miguel Patricio, 52 years old, will replace Hees as CEO.The iconic food company's stock, which has a market value of about $40.2 billion, has fallen more than 43% in the last year as it struggles to keep up with changing consumer tastes and stiff competition from new brands.Sales have grown stagnant, and its cost-cutting has recently fallen short, especially as commodity costs increase.In February, the company revealed that it had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission four months earlier related to its accounting policies and internal controls.It further disappointed investors with the news that it slashed its dividend by 36% and took a $15.4 billion write-down on Kraft and Oscar Mayer, two of its biggest brands.It also announced revenue and earnings that fell well short of Wall Street's estimates.Four days after the batch of bad news, Warren Buffett told CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway overpaid for Kraft.Back in 2015, the billionaire CEO teamed up with Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital to finance the merger between Kraft and Heinz.Berkshire and 3G are two of the company's biggest shareholders.Months earlier, in August, 3G trimmed its stake in the company by 7%, bringing its total ownership to about 22%.Jorge Lemann, 3G's founder, said at the time that the company's business model of buying up strong consumer brands was facing new difficulties from upstart brands.As a result of its troubles, Kraft Heinz has been weighing a number of divestitures, including its Maxwell House coffee business and Breakstone's sour cream and cottage cheese brand.Last November, the Capri Sun owner sold its Canadian dairy business and Indian beverage business for $1.23 billion, with the proceeds going toward paying down its debt.After signaling that another acquisition could be on its way in early 2018, the company passed on the opportunity to bid on Pinnacle Foods, which was instead snapped up by Conagra Brands.And amid speculation that Kraft Heinz could buy Campbell Soup, Hees told analysts that the company didn't want any long-term regrets when it comes to mergers and acquisitions.
After brutal year, Kraft Heinz taps AB InBev's Miguel Patricio to replace CEO Bernardo Hees:::::Kraft Heinz CEO Bernardo Hees will step down on June 30, marking the embattled company's most significant executive shakeup since its formation four years ago.Hees, 49, will be replaced by Miguel Patricio, who worked for two decades at beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev, including as chief marketing officer from 2012 through last year.Hees leaves at a critical time for Kraft Heinz, which is struggling to boost sales in the slow-growing food industry and facing questions from investors about the business model created by its second-largest shareholder, private equity firm 3G Capital, which focuses heavily on cutting costs, sometimes at the expense of brand investment.Shares of Kraft Heinz, which are down roughly 20 percent this year, rose 2 percent on the news in premarket trading, giving it a market capitalization of $40 billion."I bring very different profile [than Hees]," said Patricio, referring in part to his background in marketing."My profile can help the future.It's not about liking what happened, it's about understanding the future.We need to lead, not follow.""We think this change at the helm is a good sign for investors because it demonstrates that the company is very serious about pivoting its priorities toward growth rather than just cost cutting," wrote analysts at Credit Suisse Monday morning.The incoming CEO said his focus will be on improving Kraft Heinz's speed, organic growth, brand building and making the company more consumer focused.He would not comment on what mistakes he believes Kraft Heinz has made, and noted it was "very natural" for Hees to step down after six years on the job, two of which he spent leading Heinz.In February, Kraft Heinz delivered a trifecta of bad news: It reduced its dividend by 36 percent, wrote down its brands by $15 billion and disclosed an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into its accounting and procurement practices.That announcement sent Kraft Heinz's stock careening, wiping $16 billion off its market capitalization in one day.The company's share price is less than half what it was when it was created by 3G and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway in 2015 through the merger of H.J.Heinz and Kraft Foods.
Apple spends more than $30 million a month on Amazon Web Services:::::As Apple's top product, the iPhone, approaches market saturation, the company has begun pointing more to online services as a key contributor.Recently, the company stopped disclosing unit sales for iPhones and other hardware products and started disclosing the profit margin for its services business, which includes the iOS App Store, AppleCare, Apple Pay and iCloud.Apple also introduced new subscription services for video and magazines last month.People use more than 1 billion Apple devices each month, and accordingly, Apple has considerable computing and storage requirements.The company is investing heavily to build its own infrastructure: In January 2018, Apple announced plans to spend $10 billion on data centers in the U.S. within five years.In December, Apple said it would spend $4.5 billion of that amount through 2019.The company also depends on smaller third-party cloud providers.But it also relies on the big cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services and Alphabet subsidiary Google.Microsoft has also provided cloud tools to Apple in the past.The company has said in the past that it uses AWS for iCloud storage but has not disclosed whether any other Apple services use AWS or other third-party clouds.
Halliburton says pricing is bottoming out as US activity rises:::::Halliburton said on Monday a pricing downturn that has plagued the oilfield services sector was bottoming out, as it reported modestly higher activity levels in North America in the first quarter from a year earlier.Oilfield services providers have been struggling with a tightening of spending by U.S. oil producers as they rein in new drilling in response to shareholder pressure for greater returns after a period of heavy investment.The company's shares were up 2.8 pct at $32 before the bell.In contrast to comments from top oilfield services provider Schlumberger last week, Halliburton said activity in its largest market North America was modestly higher, adding that it expects demand for its services to progress modestly for the next couple of quarters."We believe the worst in the pricing deterioration is now behind us," Halliburton Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said, adding that it experienced pricing headwinds throughout the quarter.Schlumberger last week blamed a 3% decline in quarterly North America revenue on softer pricing and lower activity for its hydraulic fracking and drilling businesses.The company had also forecast a 10% decline in investments by oil producers onshore North America in 2019, adding that overall production growth outlook for the region could likely be lowered.The number of rigs in operation in North America fell for the past four months and production growth in the Permian and other key shale basins have slowed as oil prices fell in the fourth quarter.Constraints in pipeline carrying capacity have also forced oil producers to slow down drilling and production.Halliburton's revenue from North America fell 7% to $3.3 billion in the three months ended March 31 but came in above the $3.13 billion that five analysts had estimated on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.International revenue rose 11%, and the company reiterated its expectation of high single-digit growth for 2019.Total revenue was largely flat at $5.74 billion.Net income attributable to Halliburton rose to $152 million, or 17 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $46 million, or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the Houston-based company earned 23 cents per share, edging past analysts' average estimate of 22 cents.
Target's new brand caters to shoppers looking for 'clean' products:::::Target hopes to cater to online and in-store shoppers looking for "clean and natural" products they can feel good about buying, putting on their bodies and spraying into the air.The retailer on Monday launched a new household brand, Everspring, for items like laundry detergent, dish soap, candles and paper towels.The launch is part of Target's ongoing investment to roll out more in-house brands, including recent lines for apparel, furniture and home decor.The company is on track to have over two-dozen of its own new private labels in stores by the end of the year.These brands offer the retailer higher profit margins since it can set its own prices and bypass any middlemen.Everspring also marks Target's biggest push to offer a sustainable brand within its own lines."It has taken over a year," to bring Everspring to life, said Christina Hennington, senior vice president and general merchandise manager for Target's Essentials category."From the sourcing to the packaging, ... we had to do it right.... We hired the right expertise to make sure the chemical quality was up to expectations."The Everspring line is unique for Target in that all of the items such as cleaning wipes, dish soap and all-purpose cleaner are either biobased, meaning they're derived from plants and other renewable agricultural, marine and forestry materials or are made from recycled materials and natural fibers, according to the company.They use 100% natural fragrances to make scent combinations like mandarin and ginger, and lavender and bergamot.And they're not tested on animals."The consumers who seek this transparency of chemicals ... becoming educated on what is right for them and their family ... it's a younger consumer," Hennington said."But you can't say that across the board.There is someone of every age who cares about what goes on their bodies and in their bodies."Today, 70% of shoppers consider the environmental impact of the things they're buying, when they're out shopping, according to a study by A.T. Kearney released on Monday on Earth Day.But only about 52% of those shoppers have actually changed their purchase decisions to buy into more sustainable brands, citing typically higher costs of those items as an impediment, the study found.Target said its sales of "naturals" including "clean" brands like Mrs. Meyers, Seventh Generation and Method have grown by double-digits year-over-year since 2016.Seeing this heightened demand on its website and in stores, Target wanted to take a bigger stake in the space.Everspring-branded items range in price from $2.79 to $11.99, which is about 20 percent less than other comparable products in the marketplace today, Target said.They'll be marketed with a new "Target Clean" icon that was launched by the retailer earlier this year, indicating a product is made without a group of commonly unwanted chemicals such as sodium laureth sulfate or propylparaben.Target is starting to put the logo on certain household essentials, beauty products, personal care items and baby goods."We are listening to our guests ... and doing our homework to know what their expectations are," Hennington said.Plus, if Target can win shoppers over in the household essentials aisle with brands like Everspring those people will likely end up adding other items to their shopping baskets."This category plays a role in triggering the trip," Hennington said."Guests often choose Target for the things they buy frequently.... Then they shop the rest of the store."
Bed Bath & Beyond refreshes board as co-founders step down:::::Bed Bath & Beyond said it appointed five new independent members to its board, replacing some directors including co-founders Warren Eisenberg and Leonard Feinstein, after facing pressure from a trio of activist investors to refresh its board.Shares of the New Jersey-based company rose about 2% before the bell.Last month, activist investors Legion Partners Asset Management, Macellum Advisors GP, and Ancora Advisors urged Bed Bath & Beyond to replace its entire board and oust Chief Executive Steven Temares.
A Cartier bracelet, a glass eye and a baby among treasures left at airports:::::It's one thing to leave your heart in San Francisco, but leaving a family heirloom, an engagement ring or your lucky bowling ball at San Francisco International or any airport will have you singing a different song.Sleepy, rushed and distracted travelers leave thousands of objects at airport security checkpoints and in the terminals all the time.Cellphones, laptops, neck pillows and books are among the most common forgotten items, but some truly odd and valuable treasures also get left behind.Last month, the pilot of a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight heading to Kuala Lumpur from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia requested permission to return to the gate after a mother realized she'd left her baby behind in the boarding gate area."Ok, head back to the gate.This is totally a new one for us," an air traffic control operator tells the pilot in an audio recording that went viral on YouTube.Last week authorities at Alaska's Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (ANC) turned to social media seeking help in identifying the owner of a plastic bag containing human ashes that was left at a security checkpoint back in August."We believe the traveler left the TSA Screening Checkpoint with an urn, box, or bag, without realizing the ashes were still at the Screening Point," the ANC Police and Fire department said in its Facebook post.Here are some other surprising items passengers have left behind at airports around the country.
Jewish nurses debunk anti-vaxxer misinformation as measles spreads:::::Rebecca Feldman would like you to get a few facts straight about measles.The vaccine is safe, for starters, said the emergency room nurse practitioner.It doesn't cause autism, and Vitamin A doesn't protect you from the disease, she said.Feldman and 14 other Orthodox Jewish nurses are going line by line through a 40-page handbook that New York City health officials have identified as propaganda that's helping to fuel a measles outbreak in the region.Written by an anonymous group that calls itself Peach Parents Educating and Advocating for Children's Health the document laces largely unproven anti-vaccination theories with passages from Jewish religious texts.With the outbreak sickening more than 300 people in the city since October, Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency under which people who don't get their children vaccinated face fines.With the start of Passover this past weekend, the risk of spreading measles increases as families gather for the eight-day holiday.Feldman, who is on maternity leave, said she has personally been putting in more than four hours a day debunking misinformation in the booklet, which is being passed around in ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities in two Brooklyn neighborhoods.
US intelligence reportedly says Huawei funded by Chinese state security:::::U.S. intelligence has accused Huawei Technologies of being funded by Chinese state security, The Times said on Saturday, adding to the list of allegations faced by the Chinese technology company in the West.The CIA accused Huawei of receiving funding from China's National Security Commission, the People's Liberation Army and a third branch of the Chinese state intelligence network, the British newspaper reported, citing a source.Earlier this year, U.S. intelligence shared its claims with other members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group, which includes Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, according to the report.Huawei dismissed the allegations in a statement cited by the newspaper."Huawei does not comment on unsubstantiated allegations backed up by zero evidence from anonymous sources," a Huawei representative told The Times.The company, the CIA and China's Foreign Ministry did not respond immediately to requests for comment.The accusation comes at a time of trade tensions between Washington and Beijing and amid concerns in the United States that Huawei's equipment could be used for espionage.The company has said the concerns are unfounded.Authorities in the United States are probing Huawei for alleged sanctions violations.Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada in December at the request of the United States on charges of bank and wire fraud in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.She denies wrongdoing and her father has previously said the arrest was "politically motivated".Amid such charges, top educational institutions in the West have recently severed ties with Huawei to avoid losing federal funding.Another Chinese technology company, ZTE Corp, has also been at the center of similar controversies in the United States.U.S. sanctions forced ZTE to stop most business between April and July last year after Commerce Department officials said it broke a pact and was caught illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea.The sanctions were lifted after ZTE paid $1.4 billion in penalties.Reuters reported earlier this week that the United States will push its allies at a meeting in Prague next month to adopt shared security and policy measures that will make it more difficult for Huawei to dominate 5G telecommunications networks.
Boeing's Dreamliner jet is now facing claims of manufacturing issues:::::At a Boeing manufacturing facility in North Charleston, South Carolina, the aerospace giant reportedly pressured workers to speed up production while ignoring employee complaints about potential safety risks and defective manufacturing, according to a new report from The New York Times.After interviewing more than a dozen current and former employees of the Boeing facility, which makes the 787 Dreamliner, and reviewing "hundreds of pages of internal emails, corporate documents and federal records," The New York Times reported on Saturday that the newspaper's investigation "reveals a culture that often valued production speed over quality."Boeing workers have filed numerous safety complaints with the federal government over issues ranging from shoddy manufacturing practices to tools and debris being left on planes, and workers say they have been pressured to not report regulatory violations to authorities, The New York Times reports.The investigation found that Boeing workers have installed faulty parts in planes at the facility, and that some aircraft have even taken test flights with debris such as tools and metal shavings inside the engine or tail, creating potential safety hazards.Boeing has denied manufacturing problems with the Dreamliner, and the company said "Boeing South Carolina teammates are producing the highest levels of quality in our history," in a statement to The New York Times.However, the newspaper also reported that at least one major carrier, Qatar Airways, had been frustrated by manufacturing issues at that particular Boeing facility, with the airline opting to only buy its Dreamliners from a different Boeing facility since 2014.When reached for additional comment by CNBC, a Boeing spokesperson sent CNBC an internal memo sent today to Boeing employees by Brad Zaback, the vice president and general manager of Boeing's 787 program."A story that posted in today's New York Times, however, paints a skewed and inaccurate picture of the program and of our team here at Boeing South Carolina.This article features distorted information, rehashing old stories and rumors that have long ago been put to rest," Zaback writes in the memo, the full text of which can be found below.The report raises questions about the production process of Boeing's 787 Dreamliner at a time when the company is already facing investigations, including a federal criminal probe, into the certification process for the Boeing 737 Max.Those probes followed a pair of deadly crashes involving the aircraft, with an Ethiopian Airlines 737 Max that crashed in March coming just months after a similar crash involving a Boeing 737 Max in Indonesia.Read the full report in The New York Times Here is Zaback's full memo:
How to invest in space companies: 'UFO' ETF adds another way:::::The flood of young companies into the $400 billion space industry is sparking investor interest but there's a common issue: A lack of public U.S. companies that generate the majority of revenue from space business."The space industry is one that is still fairly new as far as corporations and the commercial viability of companies in space go," Andrew Chanin, co-founder and CEO of ProcureAM, an exchange-traded product issuer.SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, Virgin Galactic and others are some of thetoo most talked about names among these space companies.But those companies are not available to the majority of investors."Although there might be private companies that are working on new technologies, it's really difficult to get access unless you're an extremely affluent investor," Chanin said.That's why Chanin partnered with Space Investment Services, run by former Space Foundation director of research Micah Walter-Range, to develop the Procure Space ETF, ticker UFO.The exchange-traded fund of 30 companies gives everyday investors a way to own a stake in the growing space economy.UFO also focuses as much as possible on "pure play" space companies, Chanin said, as roughly 80% derive the majority of revenue from space businesses."UFO provides, compared to other types of investment vehicles, a relatively low cost and diversified away to invest in this specific theme," Chanin said.
Weed supporters are celebrating this 420 as legalization gains momentum:::::Cannabis advocates have a lot to celebrate this April 20, the unofficial marijuana holiday.Efforts to legalize marijuana are gaining momentum at both the state and federal level.Congress legalized marijuana's close cousin, hemp, in December.And public support for cannabis is higher than ever."Never in modern history have we had more political support and momentum for ending policy of marijuana prohibition," said Justin Strekal, political director of NORML, a marijuana legalization advocacy group."Now, the real questions that are being discussed throughout the halls of Congress and state legislatures and in dining rooms nationwide is no longer if but how, and the how matters."Recreational use of marijuana is now legal in 10 states and Washington, D.C. Michigan became the first state in the Midwest to allow adult recreational use last year.New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, Illinois, New Hampshire and Rhode Island are actively considering similar laws, while even more state policymakers are supporting legalization.Fourteen states have decriminalized marijuana and 33 allow medicinal marijuana use.Full federal legalization is likely still far off, but lawmakers are warming up to the idea.Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, have embraced legalization.Some lawmakers are also pushing for criminal justice reform.New Jersey Senator and 2020 Democratic hopeful Corey Booker in February reintroduced the Marijuana Justice Act, which would legalize weed and automatically expunge marijuana convictions from people's criminal records.A House committee recently marked up a bill that would allow banks to serve cannabis companies.Marijuana Moment is tracking 1,038 cannabis bills in state legislatures and Congress for the 2019 session."There's been a growing public dialogue that just feeds on itself," said Marijuana Policy Project spokesman Mason Tvert."In the last couple years and particularly this year, things are starting to change," said Morgan Fox, spokesman for the National Cannabis Industry Association.More Americans support legalizing marijuana than ever before, with two-thirds saying they think it should be made legal, according to a Gallup poll published in the fall.That's up from less than one-third in 2000.People will start hearing about cannabis much more thanks to Congress in December legalizing marijuana's close cousin hemp.Companies are now adding CBD, a non-intoxicating cannabis compound, in everything from seltzer to cheeseburgers.Yet despite the apparent optimism around cannabis, the feelings aren't universal.One-third of Americans don't think marijuana should be legal, according to the same Gallup poll.New Hampshire lawmakers passed a bill legalizing marijuana but the state's governor has vowed to veto it."We've still got a long way to go," Strekal said."We've made remarkable progress, and we're looking to build on that momentum."
What the future holds for Taco Bell after ex-CEO Brian Niccol defected to Chipotle:::::With more than 6,500 locations across the country, Taco Bell is one of the top fast-food chains in the U.S. A recent Harris Poll anointed it "America's favorite Mexican restaurant."Much of Taco Bell's innovation was initiated under the watch of former CEO, Brian Niccol.But in 2018, Niccol left the chain to helm one of Taco Bell's biggest competitors Chipotle.He has since moved Chipotle's headquarters into Taco Bell's backyard.Some say recent turnover in top management could mean trouble for Taco Bell in the years ahead.Watch this video to find out more about what the future holds for Taco Bell.Watch more:
The fastest cars debuting at New York auto show can hit 60 in under 2 seconds and top out at 300 mph:::::Bugatti will make only 20 units of this special edition of the Chiron Sport, which is meant to be a tribute to Bugatti's French homeland.The car is making its North American debut this week in New York City, after Bugatti first showed the car off at the auto show in Geneva, Switzerland last month.The base Chiron goes from 0 to 60 in 2.4 seconds with the top speed electronically limited at around 250 mph.The company has given no word on pricing, but a base Bugatti Chiron starts at around $3 million, and a Chiron Sport starts at almost $3.3 million, so this version could be as much as $4 million or more.The colors of the French flag adorn the side-view mirrors and the rear spoiler.The "110 Ans" stands for "110 years," the full history of the Bugatti name.
'Avengers: Endgame': Lead like a Marvel superhero in the workforce:::::Scarlett Johansson will play the super spy "Black Widow" for the seventh time in "Avengers: Endgame."The critically acclaimed actress recently spoke on her character's story arc, saying: "She [the character] is someone who's understanding of her own self-worth, and that is powerful to see a woman on screen represented that way."The Black Widow character, who will be getting her own movie, has had a mysterious past in the Marvel cinematic universe.However, it is a past that is hinted to be flawed and troublesome.It is Black Widow's decisiveness that makes her a great leader, according to Connie Dieken, a Fortune 500 leadership communication coach and acclaimed author."Today's leaders, not unlike super heroes, have the opportunity (and the responsibility) to influence major change in their organizations," Dieken said."Most chief executives are fully capable of making extraordinary gains with the challenges they face and I believe they want to.To do that, like Natasha, they must embrace that change begins with them."
From concept art to your collection: How Funko Pops are made:::::Fans of Funko know it's not your average toy company.In fact, CEO Brian Mariotti balks at calling the brand one.Instead, he views his business as one that trades in pop culture, offering stylized figurines and apparel of famous characters from movies, television, music and more to passionate consumers.One of its most popular items is the Funko Pop, a three-and-three-quarter inch plastic figure with a large head and big round eyes.With more than 1,000 licenses, Funko has created tens of thousands of different characters and collections from "Game of Thrones" and Fortnite to "The Golden Girls" and "Caddyshack."With a full slate of blockbuster movies coming to theaters this year, Funko is in a good position to reap rewards from excited fans.Sales in fiscal 2019 are projected to grow more than 19 percent to a range of $810 million to $825 million.Its stock has grown more than 131% this year, boosting its market value to $985.9 million Funko sells its products through a number of different retailers, often providing specific retailers with exclusive collectibles that can only be purchased with that company.Those exclusives help drive up demand and sales.For example, Barnes & Noble is the only location that customers can purchase a Mr. Rogers Funko Pop that features the character holding a puppet.Similarly, Walmart is the only place fans can get a glittery version of Marvel's Black Panther.Even drugstore Walgreens carries exclusive collectibles from Funko; it is the only place that consumers can grab a young Obi-Wan Kenobi Pop wearing a hood.Funko also works with Hot Topic, GameStop, Target, Best Buy and national and local comic book shops.Then there are the convention exclusives.At Star Wars Celebration, which was held in Chicago from April 11 to April 15, Funko sold a line of Pops that was only available to fans who attended the event.Reis O'Brien, senior product designer at Funko, shared a series of prototype images of one of the convention's exclusive "Star Wars" figures: fan favorite Darth Maul.Here's what it took to turn the evil Sith Lord into a Pop.
BlackRock's Larry Fink says there are no signs of global recession in the next 12 months:::::There are no signs that the global economy is sliding toward a recession in the next 12 months, BlackRock's Chief Executive Larry Fink said in remarks published on Saturday.In an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt, Fink warned, however, that the global economy was in the late stage of a long growth cycle, suggesting that downturn was becoming more likely."I see no signs of a global recession in the coming 12 months," said Fink, who leads the world's largest asset manager."The central banks have loosened their policy above all because of the weak fourth quarter of 2018.We will go through a phase in which things are not great but also not bad."He added: "But we are naturally in a late phase of the economic growth cycle."The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2019 this month and said growth could slow further due to unresolved trade disputes and the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.The global lender said some major economies, including China and Germany, might need to take short-term actions to prop up growth and that a severe downturn could require coordinated stimulus measures.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has ruled out taking on new debt to stimulate growth in Europe's biggest economy, saying tax cuts, higher investments and a solid labor market will continue to provide growth impetus.
Restaurants are investing in photogenic decor to attract Instagram users:::::Pelka found the tables through Instagram photos of Clown Bar, a bistro in Paris.She ordered her own personalized white versions for The Riddler."We definitely know that people like to shoot from overhead and that things photograph really beautifully on white," she said.The Riddler's tables have the added bonus of carrying both the bar's name and a tagline that also appears on its menu "Hello, old friend."When customers post their photos to Instagram, their followers will be able to tell where they went for drinks and dinner without checking the location tag.But Pelka also tries to keep Instagram from taking over The Riddler.As day turns to night, the lights are dimmed rather than staying on at full brightness for optimal photos.Joseph Szala, a principal at Vigor Branding, said lighting is another area of interest for his clients even when it comes to women's bathrooms.Restaurants want lighting that sets the mood and results in flattering photos.Like The Riddler, the most photographed design element at Media Noche, a San Francisco sandwich joint, was originally inspired by another restaurant.Madelyn Markoe and Jessie Barker, the owners of Media Noche, found inspiration for their eatery's decor during a trip to Cuba.On their return, they worked with Hannah Collins Designs now known as ROY to recreate the feeling of being in Havana.The design that they came up with includes banana wallpaper for the bathroom and custom-made tiles based on some that they saw on their trip."This was three, three-ish years ago, and even in that time period I think that being Instagrammable I don't even know if that was a word that people really used," Barker said.They weren't expecting their restaurant to become an Instagram hotspot."We wanted it to be photogenic, but more so we wanted it to match the food that we were presenting and to really transport people in Havana," Markoe said.But once they opened their doors in 2017, it took on a life of its own, Barker said.Now the two women estimate that roughly half of their customers will post their visit on Instagram, whether it's a photo of their Cuban sandwich or just their shoes on the brightly colored tile.
Raytheon awarded $28M for AN/SPY-6(V) radar integration, production:::::The AN/SPY-6(V) air and missile defense radar was installed at the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii, in February.Photo courtesy of Raytheon April 22 (UPI) -- Raytheon has been awarded a $28 million contract for integration and production support of the AN/SPY-6(V) air and missile defense radar for the U.S. Navy.The contract will include support for continued combat system integration and testing, engineering, training, software and depot maintenance as well as field engineering services, the Defense Department announced Friday.Work is expected to be completed by this December.The work will be performed at various locations, including 64 percent in Raytheon's plant in Marlborough, Mass.; as well as 18 percent in Kauai, Hawaii; 8 percent in Portsmouth, R.I.; 7 percent in San Diego; 2 percent in Fair Lakes, Va., and 1 percent in Moorestown, N.J. RELATED USS Charleston arrives in home port in San Diego Naval fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019 shipbuilding and conversion funds in the amount of $25 million will be obligated at time of award.Funds will not expire at the end of the current fiscal year.The radar is on schedule for delivery to the Navy in 2020, replacing the SPY-1 radar.In February, the Spy-6 air and missile defense radar system successfully completed its most challenging test.It searched for, detected and maintained track of a short-range ballistic missile target launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii.RELATED CARAT exercise in Sri Lanka ends early because of bombings Because the radar is built using blocks called radar modular assemblies, Raytheon bills the new radar system as the first "truly scalable" radar.The boxes can be stacked and connected to form "any size array to fit the mission requirements of any ships," the company said.The AN/SPY-6(V) radar is projected to be included on the new DDG-51 Flight III destroyer, which has "vastly increased capability" over DDG 51 Flight IIA ships, according to the Navy.The first DDH-51 Flight III destroyer, the USS Jack H. Lucas, is under construction in Pascagoula, Miss.Huntington Ingalls Industries' shipbuilding division started fabrication started fabrication last May, signifying the first 100 tons of cut steel.The second Flight III destroyer, the USS Louis H. Wilson Jr., is being built by General Dynamics' Bath Iron Works in Maine and the USS Ted Stevens will be constructed by Huntington Ingalls in Mississippi.

Paschall/U.S.Navy April 22 (UPI) -- The USS Charleston, a littoral combat ship, has arrived at its San Diego homeport after completing its maiden voyage that began at the shipyard in Alabama.The Independence-variant entered Naval Base San Diego on Friday after a 1 1/2-month trip from the East Coast.The Charleston was commissioned on March 2 in its namesake city in South Carolina.In 2017, it was christened at the Austal USA shipyard in Mobile, Ala.In the past month and a half, the ship made port calls to Mayport, Fla.; Little Creek, Va.; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and Mazatlan, Mexico as well as a successful transit through the Panama Canal, on its way to San Diego."I'm proud to say that the crew did a phenomenal job during Charleston's maiden voyage, working many long hours to execute the voyage safely," Cmdr.Christopher K. Brusca, Charleston's commanding officer, said in a news release Monday."To get Charleston ready for delivery, we've been away from our families for nine months, but during that time, the crew maintained an infectious positivity throughout every aspect of bringing this ship to the fleet."The ship falls under control of the Commander, Littoral Combat Ship Squadron One --- COMLCSRON ONE -- until the future LCS Mine Countermeasures Division is established on the West Coast."Charleston is a first-class ship with a first-class crew," said Capt.Matthew McGonigle, commander, COMLCSRON ONE."With Charleston's arrival, we now have 11 littoral combat ships homeported in San Diego and we couldn't be more proud of the hard work and positivity our LCS crews continue to demonstrate every single day."The Charleston is the ninth Independence-variant littoral combat ship, which consists of even-numbered hulls, and are manufactured by Austal USA, in Mobile, Ala. Lockheed Martin produces the Freedom variant in Marinette, Wis. RELATED Future littoral combat ship USS Cincinnati completes acceptance trials The ship, which is designated LCS-18, is the sixth Navy vessel to carry the name Charleston.It adopted South Carolina's motto -- "As I Breathe, I Hope" -- and made it its own adding a combative twist -- "As We Breathe, We Fight!"LCSs are designed for operations in the littoral environment, but are fully capable of open ocean operations because of their high-speed, agility and shallow-draft.They can counter and outpace evolving threats independently or within a network of surface combatants, according to the Navy.

Pentagon declines to disclose U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile:::::A Mark 7 nuclear bomb on display at the U.S. Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio.Photo by Chairboy/Wikimedia Commons April 18 (UPI) -- The Department of Defense denied a request to release information on the nation's nuclear stockpile, ending a practice that started a decade ago with little explanation.The Pentagon refused to comply with an Oct. 1 request by the Federation of American Scientists to provide the number of active warheads and those dismantled through the end of Fiscal Year 2019 "After careful consideration...it was determined that the requested information cannot be declassified at this time," wrote Andrew P. Weston-Dawkes, director of the Office of Classification at the Department of Energy, in a letter conveying the DoD decision on April 5.The U.S. nuclear stockpile constitutes so-called "Formerly Restricted Data," which is a classification category under the Atomic Energy Act.The DOE did not object to declassification but the Pentagon refused.RELATED Russia court convicts Norwegian of spying on nuclear sub program The Federation of American Scientists, which is a private group that "studies nuclear weapons issues and advocates for government openness on national security issues," routinely asks for the information.No reason was given for the denial in the letter.The Trump administration had disclosed to the group that the stockpile consisted of 3,822 nuclear warheads as of Sept. 30, 2017, which is a decrease of 196 warheads from 2016.Also, 354 nuclear weapons were dismantled in 2017, up from 258 the previous year.The information was first declassified in 2010.The stockpile was 5,113 warheads."Increasing the transparency of our nuclear weapons stockpile, and our dismantlement, as well, is important to both our nonproliferation efforts and to the efforts we have under way to pursue arms control that will follow the new START treaty," a Pentagon official said at a May 2010 press briefing on the decision to release the information.Previously, only the size of the historic stockpile through 1961 had been officially disclosed in 1993.Hans Kristensen and Robert Norris of FAS had estimated the United States had 5,200 warheads in 2009, which was 87 more than the total that was released.In the past, stockpile declassification has not led to greater openness by Russia."I think we should have more communication with Russia," said U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, the retiring Supreme Allied Commander Europe."It would ensure that we understand each other and why we are doing what we're doing."

David L. Goldfein."When it comes to having a 'quarterback' for the coalition joint force, the inter-operable F-35A is clearly the aircraft for the leadership role."In the fall of 2017, the F-35A deployed to Royal Air Force Lakenheath in England, as well as the U.S. Pacific Command area of responsibility.The F-35s are now part of a coalition that carries out airstrikes against the Taliban in Afghanistan and scattered remnants of the Islamic State.One month ago, the B-1B Lancer bombers completed their deployment at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar."We are adding a cutting edge weapons system to our arsenal that significantly enhances the capability of the coalition," Lt. Gen. Joseph T. Guastella, U.S. Air Forces Central Command commander, said."The sensor fusion and survivability this aircraft provides to the joint force will enhance security and stability across the theater and deter aggressors."The F-35A is replacing planes such as the F-16 and A-10, which have been the Air Force's primary fighter jets for more than 20 years.The U.S. Navy will replace the F/A-18 with F-35C for carriers and the U.S. Marines will replace the F/A-18 and AV-8B Harrier with the F-35B for short takeoff and vertical landing."Numerous militaries around the world also need to recapitalize their aging fighter fleets with modern, more capable aircraft," Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor, said on its website."The F-35 was designed to recapitalize allied fighter fleets and counter emerging threats."Principal partners are Northrop Grumman and BAE System.Pratt & Whitney builds the F-35's F135 propulsion system The plane includes fully fused sensor information, network-enabled operations and advanced sustainment.The Lightning II is a single-seat, single-engine fighter aircraft with a range of more than 1,350 miles with internal fuel, according to the Air Force.It was introduced to the Air Force in 2016.

Land O'Lakes CEO Beth Ford, from the cornfield to the C-suite:::::Beth Ford's first job paid $2 an hour.Early in the morning, she climbed on the school bus to go detassel corn, joining other kids in Sioux City, Iowa, who did it as a summer job."Back then, two dollars an hour, that was real money," Ford tells CNN's Poppy Harlow in the latest episode of Boss Files Now, as the first female CEO of Land O'Lakes and the first openly gay female CEO in the Fortune 500 list of largest US companies Ford remembers a conversation with her mother years ago that taught her that "while we may not have everything, we have enough, and given what we have, much was expected of us.""She said, 'Do you understand what is expected of you?Do you understand how much you have?Don't disappoint,' and I was like, 'I've gotta work hard to not disappoint,'" Ford says.Ford has a vision for Land O'Lakes.She wants to transform people's perceptions of the butter and cream company and refocus attention on the efforts it's making in the ag-tech space."My vision is to continue to invest in technology," she says."You have to have agility.E-commerce and e-business and technology is disrupting all industries, including agriculture, and there's an opportunity when you have an insight-driven, technology-focused company, as I believe Land O' Lakes is."The future of Land O'Lakes In July, the United States slapped tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports , a move China called the beginning of "the biggest trade war in economic history."In response, China imposed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of US exports, including cotton, dairy and soybeans."Grain farmers, growers, and producers across the US are all affected by the uncertainty churning around trade negotiations and retaliatory tariffs," Ford says."Export market access is critical to these farmers and the agriculture industry and we're seeing a slowdown due to uncertainty in the trade environment."Ford says she's spoken with soybean farmers and others concerned with the tariff politics."What I would tell you is that our farmer members are supportive in understanding that the administration is trying to do something on intellectual property theft," she says."They want to make sure that they have appropriate trade agreements, and I think that they're supportive."More than anything else, she says, these farmers need resolution and clarity quickly."Time is critical," she says."So then what's the most important thing the administration can do?They can move with speed and resolve these trade issues and resolve those tariff issues."Being a first When the announcement about Ford's promotion to CEO went out, the press release celebrated her achievements, but it made no special mention of an important "first" in Fortune 500 history.With Ford's promotion, she became the first openly gay female CEO to lead a Fortune 500 company.In the months since, she's heard from people about how much that "first" has meant to them."People have come up to me and said, 'Thank you,'" she says."And it's not just the LGBTQ community, it is just people in their normal life saying, 'Thank you for being your authentic self and encouraging others to do that.'"Ford says she's never faced discrimination in her career, but she's definitely considered its potential impact on herself and her family."I had made deliberate decisions for some places where I felt as though it may not be as friendly," she says."I said, 'The job looks great.You're a wonderful leader.I can't be here because I don't think this will be great.My spouse is a woman, and I have a daughter."Thinking about the dwindling percentage of female CEOs in the Fortune 500 , she says progress can't be truly made until the overall number of women leaders increases something that she sees as "a shared responsibility" for management teams and their talent development programs.On that path to the C-suite, she calls back to an important lesson, yet again from her mother: "Beth, if you want something, ask for it.""You expect you're going to be recognized because you've done the hard work, and that isn't actually how it always happens," Ford says.
Goldman Sachs slants research to help Democrats, top White House adviser says:::::New York (CNN Business) Kevin Hassett, one of President Donald Trump's top economic advisers, suggested that Goldman Sachs may be slanting its economic research to help Democrats ahead of the midterm elections.The Goldman Sachs economics team "almost at times looks like the Democratic opposition," Hassett told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Tuesday.The comment came after Harlow asked Hassett about a Goldman Sachs research report warning that a 25% US tariff on all imports from China could wipe out corporate profit growth in 2019.Hassett said he hadn't read the research, but went on to criticize Goldman's track record.Hassett claimed its analysis of last year's tax cuts was "really, really wrong and timed in a partisan way."He said Goldman's analysis predicted the tax cuts would be "really harmful" to the economy or have little impact before jacking up its forecast after they passed."So maybe they're just trying to make a partisan point before the elections," said Hassett, chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers.
China says it will never use its currency as a weapon in the trade war:::::The trade war between China and the United States is intensifying, but Beijing has just taken one potential weapon off the table.Premier Li Keqiang told an audience of global executives and policymakers that China would not weaken the yuan to boost trade with the rest of the world."China will never go down the path of stimulating exports by devaluing its currency," Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said Wednesday.His comments came a day after the United States and China announced that they would impose their biggest rounds of tariffs yet on each other's exports, starting next week.That brings the value of goods hit by tariffs in the escalating conflict to more than $360 billion.President Donald Trump has threatened to hit another $267 billion of Chinese goods with tariffs.China, which buys far less from the United States than the other way round, is starting to run low on American products to target, raising speculation about what other measures it could take to hit back.Driving down the currency, which is also known as the renminbi, isn't one of them, according to Li."Persistent depreciation of the renminbi will only do more harm than good to our country," he said during a speech at a World Economic Forum event in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin.The yuan has dropped sharply against the dollar as the trade fight has ramped up, losing about 9% of its value since April.Accused of manipulation The decline has drawn the attention of President Trump, who has often accused China of devaluing the yuan to boost its huge export industry.Trump claimed in July that China was "manipulating" its currency lower.Li dismissed that idea on Wednesday."The recent fluctuations in the renminbi exchange rate have been seen by some as an intentional measure on the part of China," he said."This is simply not true."The Chinese government plays a significant role in setting the value of the yuan and how it trades.Economists generally agree Beijing kept the currency artificially low in the past, but they are skeptical that government intervention has driven it down against the dollar and other major currencies this year.They say the escalating trade war with the United States and concerns over a slowdown in the Chinese economy have helped push the yuan lower at a time when the US Federal Reserve is steadily raising interest rates.That policy makes it more attractive for investors to hold assets in US dollars, prompting them to sell other currencies.Sudden drops in the yuan in 2015 and early 2016 set off turmoil in global markets as money poured out of China's economy.Beijing spent hundreds of billions of dollars propping it up.China will "work to create conditions for keeping the value of the yuan stable," Li said Wednesday.His words weren't enough to convince everyone, though."Manipulation has occurred and is occurring, and I hope that action is taken," Todd Rokita, a Trump-supporting congressman from Indiana, told CNN at the Tianjin conference just minutes after Li's speech.
The next big test for Elon Musk arrives this week:::::New York (CNN Business) 1.Back to business: The SEC is off Elon Musk's back.Now he and Tesla can return to that other pesky problem making and selling cars.Tesla will turn in a critical production report on Tuesday that will show investors whether the company can sustain and surpass its long-promised target of building 5,000 Model 3s per week.That report will go a long way toward determining whether Tesla ( TSLA ) can fulfill Musk's pledge to turn a profit in the third and fourth quarters.Since it went public, Tesla has recorded only two quarters in the black.It posted the largest loss in its history in the second quarter as it cranked up production to clear the 5,000 bar in the last week of June.That seems like a long time ago.In early August, Musk sent the tweet that led to his tangle with regulators a cryptic announcement that he had "funding secured" to take Tesla private at $420 per share.The SEC said he had no such thing, and sued Musk last week for misleading investors.Under a settlement announced Saturday , Musk agreed to step aside as chairman for three years, and he and Tesla each agreed to pay $20 million fines.Musk neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing under the settlement.The SEC lawsuit may be behind him, but Tesla still has some serious IOUs coming up.A total of $2.7 billion of Tesla debt is due this year and next, according to Goldman Sachs.That's one reason the production and profit targets are so important: Tesla needs the cash to pay down all that debt.The markets have reflected investors' worry .Tesla bonds maturing in August 2025 traded at 84.5 cents on the dollar on Friday, close to a record low.And Tesla stock has fallen 31% from its high in the hours after the ill-fated tweet.The stock may bounce back Monday, now that the uncertainty over Musk's future is removed.But Wall Street still wants something else results.2.Jobs, jobs, jobs: Analysts expect another month of solid growth when the US Labor Department issues its September jobs report on Friday.More important may be the wage growth figure: Will it hit 3% for the first time since April 2009?If so, will that unnerve investors worried about an overly aggressive Federal Reserve?3.Changing of the guard at Goldman: Lloyd Blankfein is ending his run as CEO of Goldman Sachs ( Lloyd Blankfein is ending his run as CEO of Goldman Sachs ( GS ) on Monday.He will be replaced by Goldman president and part-time DJ David Solomon.The investment firm's stock is down more than 10% since beginning of the year.Solomon will need to deal with lower revenue from Goldman's trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell bonds, commodities and currencies.4.Earnings watch: It's a relatively slow week for corporate reports, but among the notable names turning in results are Pepsi ( It's a relatively slow week for corporate reports, but among the notable names turning in results are Pepsi ( PEP ), Stitch Fix, Bon-Ton and Costco.For Pepsi, this will be the last earnings report under CEO Indra Nooyi, soon to be succeeded by the company's global operations chief, Ramon Laguarta.The stock could use a caffeine boost: It's down 7% this year.5.Rebooting business news: On Thursday, CNNMoney On Thursday, CNNMoney becomes the all-new CNN Business , covering the companies, personalities, and innovations driving business forward.This new initiative will focus on the single biggest financial story of our generation: how technology is upending every corner of the global economy, forcing businesses, workers, and society itself to adapt rapidly, or be left behind.6.Coming this week: Monday Stitch Fix and Wage Works earnings; David Solomon becomes Goldman Sachs CEO; Eurozone unemployment rate Tuesday PepsiCo earnings; US auto sales for September Wednesday Lennar earnings; ADP employment report Thursday Costco ( Costco ( COST ) earnings; CNN Business launches Friday US jobs report

CEOs are cashing in on the market boom:::::CEOs are using the market boom to quietly cash in their own chips.Insiders at US companies have dumped $5.7 billion of stock this month, the highest in any September over the past decade, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by TrimTabs Investment Research.It's not a new trend.Insiders, which include corporate officers and directors, sold shares in August at the fastest pace in 10 years as well, TrimTabs said.The selling is noteworthy because it occurred as the market rebounded sharply from an early 2018 tumble.Fueled by tax cuts and a strong economy, the Dow recently notched its first record high since January.Some corporate insiders have much of their net worth tied up in stock, so it could be that they are simply exercising caution.The bull market, already the longest history, can't last forever."It's a very prudent thing for them to unload some shares -- no matter how much they like the stock," said Joe Saluzzi, co-partner at brokerage firm Themis Trading."It doesn't necessarily mean they see something wrong."TrimTabs does not break down how many of the insider sales were pre-planned.The SEC allows executives to schedule stock sales ahead of time to avoid the appearance of insider trading.While the captains of Corporate America are cashing out, they are doing the exact opposite with shareholder money.US public companies have authorized a stunning $827.4 billion of stock buybacks in 2018 -- already a record for any year, according to TrimTabs.Apple (AAPL) alone announced plans last quarter for $100 billion of buybacks.The flurry of buybacks has been viewed by investors as a sign of confidence among CEOs."Insiders aren't announcing buybacks because they think stocks are cheap," said David Santschi, director of liquidity research at TrimTabs."What they're doing with shareholders' money and their own is quite different."Companies use buybacks as a way to return excess cash to shareholders.Share repurchases benefit investors -- and executives that are paid mostly in stock -- by providing persistent demand that tends to boost prices.Buybacks also artificially inflate earnings per share by eliminating the number of shares outstanding.Corporate America is enjoying record profitability thanks to the strong economy and a big reduction in what they owe Uncle Sam.The Republican tax law reduced the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% and also gave companies a break on foreign profits that are returned to the United States.The tax windfall has also enabled companies to spend more on job-creating investments like new equipment and research projects.But buybacks are growing even faster.In fact, Goldman Sachs found that buybacks are garnering the largest share of cash spending by S&P 500 companies for the first time in a decade.Given the spike in buybacks, Saluzzi said it would be odd if insiders are rapidly dumping shares outside of preplanned transactions."You've got to raise your eyebrows and look at what's going on here," Saluzzi said.
GE is worth less than $100 billion for the first time since the Great Recession:::::General Electric, once America's most valuable company, is now in sharp decline.In a year full of dubious landmarks, GE has encountered another: The storied conglomerate is now worth less than $100 billion.That hasn't happened since March 2009 -- during the Great Recession.GE's (GE) stock crash -- down by nearly two-thirds since the end of 2016 -- has knocked the company down to the 59th most valuable in the S&P 500.It's a stunning reversal.GE was No.1 in the S&P 500 as recently as 2004, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.At the time, it was worth nearly $400 billion.Now GE is worth just a tenth of Apple (AAPL), the $1 trillion top dog of the market, and it's fallen behind Salesforce (CRM), PayPal (PYPL) and Nvidia (NVDA).GE's struggles got it kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average this summer.GE was an original member of the exclusive index in 1896 and had been in it continuously for 110 years.Plunging profits and mounting debt have driven GE's shares down by 35% this year.Only four S&P 500 companies have had a worse 2018.The most remarkable part about GE's decline is it comes at a time when the American economy and stock market are soaring.Rival industrial companies including Honeywell (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) are booming.But GE has been hobbled by years of poorly timed deals and needless complexity that have finally come home to roost.To pay off debt and jump-start the stock, GE is selling off countless businesses, including its century-old railroad division, Thomas Edison's light-bulb unit, Baker Hughes and the health-care unit that makes MRI machines.Selling in GE's stock has accelerated in recent days because of worries about GE Power, the most troubled part of the slumping conglomerate.GE confirmed last week that two of its gas turbines failed, forcing the closure of power plants.The turbine trouble could hurt the company's reputation and sales at a time when it's already strapped for cash.In a statement, GE said that it has "identified a fix" and has been working with customers to "quickly return units to service."JPMorgan Chase analyst C. Stephen Tusa, Jr, Wall Street's biggest GE bear, told clients the turbine failure "raises red flags" about GE Power.Others think that shareholders are overreacting.Most likely, GE's "fundamental technology is sound" and repair costs will be "manageable," Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin wrote to clients.
The US minimum wage through the years:::::When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Americas first federal minimum wage into law in 1938, it was 25 cents per hour.Adjusted for inflation, that would be worth about $4.45 today.Scroll over the chart to see the US federal minimum wage through history, and what it would be worth in todays dollars.Throughout history, Congress has raised the minimum wage 22 times.The current level, at $7.25 an hour, was set in 2009.Cities and states have the option of setting their own minimum wages.As of January 2019, 29 states had a minimum wage rate above the federal level.
Why investors aren't freaking out about inflation:::::Bond yields in the United States have been rising.But investors aren't freaking out.The Dow and S&P 500 both hit all-time highs last week -- and the Nasdaq is not far from a record, either.The 10-Year Treasury yield is still relatively low, but it has topped the psychologically important 3% threshold and is currently hovering around 3.1%.The concern is that this may be just the beginning.Longer-term rates could keep climbing given that the Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term rates Wednesday.At some point, investors may start to grow wary of what rising rates will mean for consumer spending and businesses looking to borrow more money.Higher rates, in theory, should lead to slower growth for both the economy and corporate earnings.The question is: how many more rate hikes are coming?Fed chair Jerome Powell may provide some clues at a press conference after the Fed decision is announced.Craig Birk, chief investment officer of Personal Capital, said that the market should be able to handle a few more quarter-point rate increases.But many investors may have gotten spoiled since rates were unusually low for so long.The federal funds rate is now in a range of 1.75% to 2% and there are expectations it could climb above 3% over the next year.Birk said many investors are hoping the Fed will end its rate hiking campaign in 2019 though."We finally have a real interest rate, not one that's just zero," Birk said."The Fed is still saying that they will likely raise rates slowly and steadily but the market seems to be betting they will stop sooner."Birk added the Fed had been run by so-called doves, people like former Fed chairs Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen who preferred to keep rates low, for years.Investors are trying to adjust to the new mindset at the Fed."The market is still getting used to the idea that the Fed will be more balanced and more hawkish," Birk said.In other words, investors may be underestimating the willingness of the Fed to keep raising rates -- despite criticism from President Donald Trump about rate hikes and even if the data doesn't conclusively show inflation picking up in a meaningful way.Still, some experts think the Fed is likely to stick to its path of gradual rate increases.Powell, like his predecessors, is probably not interested in rattling the bond and stock markets with surprise moves."We do not see rising interest rates as a reason to sell stocks, particularly in the absence of runaway inflation," wrote John Lynch, chief investment strategist for LPL Financial, in a report Tuesday.Inflation is still under control for now Wage growth is picking up, but that hasn't led to a big spike in consumer prices.So the Fed may still have some wiggle room to keep raising rates since the economy appears to be on solid footing."The market is interpreting higher rates as a response to better growth, not as a reason to fear a policy mistake, which we find encouraging," Lynch added.Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA, isn't overly worried about inflation getting out of control either."It's premature to say the Fed is behind the curve," said Keon."The question is what happens next year and 2020.There are some reasons to believe price pressures may continue to build.I don't think rates will get too high."Keon thinks the 10-Year Treasury yield could climb to a range of about 3.25% to 3.5%.That's still low enough to keep the economy humming along at a relatively solid clip, even if growth slows a bit.So the biggest change that might come from the Fed's rate hikes is a shift in the types of stocks that investors favor most.Tech stocks, retailers and other consumer companies, big winners of the past year, may start to lose some ground to financials.Yousef Abbasi, global market strategist with INTL FCStone, is bullish on regional bank stocks (KRE) and Bank of America (BAC), which has a big mortgage business.They should benefit from higher rates since it will make their lending operations more profitable.
Countries with higher wages than U.S.:::::
Corporate America, not banks, could cause the next recession:::::1.The next debt crisis: There's a $6.3 trillion elephant in the room.And it just might cause the next recession.The last downturn was triggered by Wall Street and Americans accumulating too much debt particularly in the sizzling housing market.A decade later, it's Corporate America borrowing with gusto.Egged on by extremely low rates, US companies have piled on a record-setting $6.3 trillion of debt, according to S&P Global Ratings.All that debt is easy to ignore right now.Default rates are minuscule.Companies are sitting on tons of cash, and their coffers are growing thanks to the soaring US economy and corporate tax cuts.But eventually, both the economy and corporate profits will slow, leaving companies less firepower to pay down debt.And it won't be as easy to roll over the debt that's due.Debt-laden companies would be vulnerable to rising borrowing costs caused by the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes.If companies are stuck in a credit crunch, they will have to pull back on hiring and investment.That could be a recipe for a recession."Corporates, not consumers or banks, will cause [the] next recession," Michael Hartnett, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's chief investment strategist, wrote to clients on Thursday.Corporate America's debt binge has helped finance the recovery.Companies have borrowed to open factories, buy equipment and develop products.A chunk of that debt has also gone to reward Wall Street with massive stock buybacks.After a decade of low rates, companies have taken on more debt relative to the size of the economy than ever before.Total US business debt as a percentage of GDP is at a record high, according to David Ader of Informa Financial Intelligence.The riskiest category of borrowers has never been more leveraged.Companies with junk credit ratings are holding a record low $8 of debt for every $1 of cash, according to S&P.And then there are so-called zombie companies which can't even afford interest payments, despite the strong economy and low rates.Ben Breitholtz, data scientist at Bianco Research, found that 14% of the companies in the S&P 1500 don't have enough earnings before interest and taxes to cover interest expenses.That's above the world average of 10%.Those zombie companies are probably cringing as central bankers slowly end the easy-money days.The Fed is expected to lift rates on Wednesday, the eighth hike since late 2015.Four more moves before the end of 2019 may be in the cards.At the same time, the Fed is trimming its $4.5 trillion balance sheet an experiment that could contribute to higher borrowing costs as foreign central banks follow suit and unload bonds.Bank of America's Hartnett warned that an "aggressive" Fed in 2019 could trigger a "credit crunch" not just in emerging markets, but in Corporate America.2.Trade war: The US-China confrontation will escalate on Monday when the United States imposes tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.On the same day, China has pledged to retaliate with a tariff on $60 billion of American goods.The trade war is causing problems for Walmart, Procter & Gamble and a host of other companies that sell products imported from China or depend on Chinese goods in their supply chains.3.Nike earnings: What do Nike executives have to say about the response to their Colin Kaepernick ad campaign?We'll find out Tuesday, when the company reports earnings.Nike has had a good year: US sales are growing, and the stock is up 35%.4.Economy watch: The US government on Thursday will give the final reading on economic growth in the second quarter.The previous revision showed a strong growth rate of 4.2%.5.Coming this week: Monday US imposes tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods; MacOS Mojave launches Tuesday KB Home (KBH) and Nike (NKE) earnings; US consumer confidence Wednesday Bed Bath & Beyond and Carmax earnings; Federal Reserve interest rate decision; US new home sales for August Thursday Rite Aid, Carnival and Accenture earnings; final revision of US second-quarter GDP Friday End of Q3
Blind Brexit? Businesses fear even more uncertainty:::::Business is worried enough about Britain crashing out of the European Union.Now it has a new nightmare: a blind Brexit that could extend the uncertainty over trade for years.Fears are rising that the United Kingdom may leave the European Union in March 2019 with a deal so vague that it gives companies and investors no greater clarity on the future than they had in June 2016 when voters backed Brexit in a referendum.The political pressure increased Thursday when the only firm proposal for Brexit was panned by a key EU leader and French President Emmanuel Macron described people who said leaving the bloc would be easy as "liars.""The prospect of a vague Brexit, with only a slimline political declaration about the future EU-UK relationship published alongside a legally-binding withdrawal agreement, is gaining ground," said Mujtaba Rahman of the political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.A blind Brexit may be even worse for some companies than a scenario where the United Kingdom leaves in March without an agreement on preferential access to Europe's vast markets.That would deliver a major shock but executives would at least know what they're dealing with.Stephen Phipson, CEO of the manufacturing trade group EEF, said further years of uncertainty would be most painful for large foreign manufacturers with complicated supply chains that crisscross borders.Investments on hold Global companies such as Airbus (EADSF), Siemens (SMAWF), BMW (BMWYY), and Nissan (NSANF) are in the firing line."An automotive manufacturer that has three plants here and one in Eastern Europe, he's going to put his investment over there," said Phipson."Boards won't release capital to invest because they're not sure of the environment."Many companies have put investments on hold following the vote for Brexit because they don't know whether they'll face new regulations, tariffs or customs checks at borders.It's also unclear if they'll be able to move staff between the European Union and the United Kingdom, or be forced to pay new taxes.BMW (BMWYY) said Tuesday that it would shut its Mini factory in England for one month of maintenance immediately after Brexit because it can't be sure of getting the parts it needs.Jaguar cited uncertainty over Brexit as one reason for putting 1,000 workers on a three-day work week until Christmas.Some executives have pinned their hopes on a proposal developed by British Prime Minister Theresa May that would maintain close trading ties in goods and agricultural products and include a transition period of nearly two years.But the European Union's top political leader Donald Tusk took a hard line on the plan known as Chequers after a meeting of EU leaders in Salzburg on Thursday, saying the proposal would not work because it risks undermining the bloc's single market in goods and services.'Very unappealing' May insisted that her plan is the only way forward.Still, she could be forced back to the drawing board by pressure from the European Union, her own party or the opposition.But even a blind Brexit would have opponents, including some that argue Britain would be giving up its negotiating ace: money it owes to the European Union."Hardliners will fight back by saying that the UK is throwing away its best card the 39 billion divorce payment to the EU for vague warm words about the future relationship and so would have little or no leverage during the talks on it during the transitional phase," said Rahman.Asked about a scenario where a blind Brexit was followed by Britain eventually crashing out the bloc without a final deal on trade, Phipson was unequivocal."That sounds very unappealing," he said.
What trade war? Dow hits record high:::::What trade war?The Dow just soared to its first record high since late January.The milestone shows that Wall Street is mostly unfazed by the escalating trade clash between the United States and China.The Dow's 251-point leap on Thursday marked its 100th record close since President Donald Trump's election, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.The S&P 500 also notched an all-time high.The Dow closed at 26,657.It has spiked about 3,300 points since a low on April 2, when investors were more worried about trade.They're betting that the strong US economy will power through the outbreak of tariffs."The market is showing incredible strength," said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group.Stocks spiked late last year and in January after Republicans enacted a sweeping corporate tax cut.The euphoria sent the Dow soaring from 25,000 to 26,000 in just seven trading days.Even market optimists were questioning whether stock valuations had gotten out of hand."In January, it felt like the market was bulletproof," said Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors."That's no longer the case."Eventually, that rally crumbled in dramatic fashion, punctuated by two single-day 1,000-point plunges.Wall Street was overcome by fears about inflation and spiking interest rates.It was the scariest moment for US investors in years."Sentiment had gotten really out of hand.The pullback was a reality check.The lack of a new high for so long has let the market play catchup to fundamentals," Hickey said.And the fundamentals look very good.Corporate earnings have gone through the roof, thanks to strong economic growth and the corporate tax cut.The unemployment rate has dropped to just 3.9%.And US economic growth has climbed to an annualized pace of 4.2%."What matters most to investors is corporate profits," Suzuki said."The profit trends are healthy and accelerating.That's tremendously bullish for US stocks."
China strikes back by going after America's energy companies:::::This story was originally published September 19, 2018.New York (CNN Business) The United States has an abundance of natural gas that pollution-riddled China badly needs to wean itself off coal.Eying China's voracious demand, Cheniere Energy, ExxonMobil (XOM) and other American energy companies are racing to build more than two dozen expensive facilities to export liquefied natural gas, which is super-cooled natural gas that can be transported by ship.China even marked President Donald Trump's visit to Beijing last fall by agreeing to invest as much as $43 billion into an LNG project in Alaska.But this pairing of an able buyer and well-supplied seller no longer looks like a slam dunk.As part of the escalating trade war, China on Tuesday said it will impose a 10% tariff on $60 billion of US products -- including LNG.The trade tensions could make it more difficult for the next wave of LNG export facilities to get the financing needed to get off the ground.Read More
Investors are starting to worry about the economy:::::Wall Street doesn't seem to care about the escalating trade war between the United States and China.The Dow jumped 175 points and the Nasdaq climbed 1% on Tuesday despite Washington and Beijing pushing ahead with another round of punishing tariffs.Investors are betting the US economy will continue to power ahead of the rest of the world.Yet beneath the surface, some are getting worried about the ability of the global economy to withstand the trade war and brewing storms in emerging markets.One in four professional investors is bracing for global growth to slow over the next year, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch survey published on Tuesday.That's the worst outlook in this monthly survey since December 2011 and up from August when just 7% of investors were pessimists.And nearly half of investors surveyed by Bank of America believe the US economy will decelerate and rejoin the rest of the world.Just one in three said that in August."Investors are holding on to more cash, telling us they are bearish growth," Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote to clients.Not surprisingly, the trade war topped the worry list for the fourth straight month.The second-most popular "tail risk" is related: a slowdown in China's economy.The survey was conducted September 7-September 13, before President Donald Trump leveled a 10% tariff on $200 billion worth of imports from China AND Beijing said it will retaliate by putting tariffs on $60 billion worth of US imports at a rate of 5% to 10%."It certainly does seem that we're approaching spiral stage," Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote to clients on Tuesday.Anne Van Praagh, a managing director at Moody's, said that higher tariffs will "hurt the economy by distorting prices," creating inefficiencies and having a chilling effect on investment decisions.'Black Swan' gauge on the rise Wall Street seemed to take the news in stride: the Dow climbed within 400 points of an all-time high, the first since January.The VIX (VIX) volatility index, a measure of market turbulence, declined 7% to a very quiet level of 13.Recall that the so-called "fear gauge" shot up to 50 in February.However, a lesser known barometer of investor worry is sending more ominous signals.The CBOE SKEW Index rises when option trades signal that concern about a "black swan" incident -- an unexpected event that has a huge impact.The index is trading near the highest level since records began in 1990.US markets have been bolstered by a strong domestic economy that can hopefully shrug off the trade tensions.The US unemployment rate is sitting at just 3.9%.America's gross domestic product climbed at an annualized pace of 4.2% in the second quarter.Despite the trade standoff, growth is on track to accelerate to 4.4% in the third quarter, according to a volatile forecasting model from the Atlanta Federal Reserve.'It's going to be a mess' The impact from proposed tariffs on GDP growth in the United States is likely to be "very modest," Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote to clients on Tuesday.Hatzius said that while there is a chance that Washington and Beijing reach a resolution, "further escalation seems likely" and the situation is "highly uncertain."Still, some prominent business leaders are starting to sound the alarm.The Business Roundtable, a powerful lobby led by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) boss Jamie Dimon, issued a statement saying that "unilaterally imposing tariffs is the wrong way to achieve real reforms" and threatens "further harm to US businesses and workers."FedEx (FDX) CEO Fred Smith told analysts on Monday that the US-China trade fight is "worrisome to everyone" and may already be causing China's economy to moderate.Alibaba (BABA) founder Jack Ma warned the US-China trade war could last for 20 years."It's going to last long, it's going to be a mess," Ma said on Tuesday.
Executives on the front line worry about where the trade war goes next:::::Companies in the front line of the trade war between the United States and China are anxious about what comes next.Executives at a World Economic Forum event in the northern Chinese city of Tianjin have been digesting the dramatic escalation in the conflict this week.Some appear relaxed, some worried, while others are hoping for the best.The Trump administration launched its biggest barrage of tariffs against China early Tuesday.Within hours, Beijing said it would retaliate with more tariffs of its own."This round of tariffs is going to cause even more damage for US companies," said William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.The head of Coca-Cola (KO) in China, Curtis Ferguson, isn't fretting yet about the impact on his business.His supply chain is local, and he doesn't expect Chinese consumers to stop buying Coke in the way they boycotted South Korean goods during a political spat between Beijing and Seoul last year."If that was a card for China, I think they would have played that one," he said.The vast majority of Coca-Cola's 50,000 strong workforce in the country are Chinese, and targeting the company could put jobs at risk, he added.But Ferguson is also concerned about what may be around the corner."Business doesn't like uncertainty.We're for free trade," Ferguson told CNN on the sidelines of the meeting in Tianjin."I don't know how bad things will get."While it's running out of US imports to target with new tariffs, China could find other ways to make life difficult for global brands.US companies operating in China have already reported increased hurdles, including delays at customs and more inspections by regulators, according to a recent survey by two American chambers of commerce based in the country.'Aggressive US sanctions' Some businesses, such as Japanese drinks group Suntory, (STBFY) are already feeling the financial pinch.CEO Takeshi Niinami said the trade war was an "immediate threat" to the company's bottom line."We have huge investments in the United States where we produce bourbon that's exported to other countries," he said during a panel discussion on Wednesday.The company now faces tariffs on its exports from the United States into China and the European Union."The whole global supply chain is getting hurt by aggressive US sanctions," Niinami added.Others are looking anxiously at what the dispute may mean for plans to enter the Chinese market, even if there's little they can do to avoid being caught in the crossfire.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) wants to take advantage of Beijing's efforts to open up its financial industry and recently applied to launch a brokerage in the country.Beyond 'our control' Asked if he was worried Beijing could withhold approval for the venture because of the trade war, JPMorgan China CEO Mark Leung said that it's "not within our control."The bank is "working constructively" with regulators, and still hoped to get a license soon, he added.Trade experts expect China to dig in for a war of attrition with the United States.A resolution could be a long way off."Eventually there will be a negotiated solution," said Wendy Cutler, vice president of think tank the Asia Society Policy Institute.That could involve China toning down parts of its industrial policy, which the US administration says facilitates the theft of intellectual property."It's going to require both sides to show flexibility," Cutler added.Coca-Cola's Ferguson suggested a more novel way to fix the relationship."Trump seems to have figured out Twitter (TWTR), but I think he needs to get WeChat and get talking with President Xi," he said, referring to Tencent's (TCEHY) popular Chinese social networking app.
Corporate America is spending more on buybacks than anything else:::::For the first time in a decade, Corporate America is steering more money into stock buybacks than investing in the future.S&P 500 companies rewarded shareholders with $384 billion worth of buybacks during the first half of 2018, according to a Goldman Sachs report published Friday.That big bonanza for Wall Street is up 48% from last year and reflects spiking profitability thanks to corporate tax cuts and the strong US economy.But that doesn't mean companies aren't spending on job-creating investments, like new equipment, research projects and factories.Business spending is up 19% it's just that buybacks are growing much faster.In fact, Goldman Sachs said that buybacks are garnering the largest share of cash spending by S&P 500 firms.It's a milestone because capital spending had represented the single largest use of cash by corporations in 19 of the past 20 years.And the trend may not be done yet.Goldman Sachs predicted that share buyback authorizations among all US companies in all of 2018 will surpass $1 trillion for the first time ever.Apple (AAPL) alone spent a whopping $45 billion on buybacks during the first half of 2018, triple what it did during the same time period last year, the firm said.That included a record-shattering sum during the first quarter.Amgen (AMGN), Cisco (CSCO), AbbVie (ABBV) and Oracle (ORCL) have also showered investors with big boosts to their buyback programs.'Blackout' poses risk Buybacks are typically cheered by shareholders, at least in the short term.One reason is that buybacks artificially inflate earnings per share by eliminating the number of shares outstanding.Moreover, companies stepping into the market with giant purchase orders provide persistent demand, lifting share prices.The impact of buybacks is so profound that some worry about how stocks will hold up without them.Companies generally aren't allowed to buy back stock during so-called "blackout" periods that begin the month before reporting earnings.David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, warned that the upcoming blackout period poses a "near-term risk" to the market.He noted that market volatility tends to be higher during buyback blackouts.Business spending on the rise The good news is that large companies are investing a sizable chunk of their winnings from the corporate tax overhaul.The Republican tax law, enacted in late 2017, slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.It also gave companies a tax break on foreign profits that are returned to the United States.Capital spending is on track for the fastest growth in at least 25 years, Goldman Sachs estimates."Rumors of the demise of capital spending have been greatly exaggerated," Kostin wrote.The growth of business spending, much like buybacks, has been dominated by some of the biggest companies in the United States.Goldman Sachs estimates that 79% of the growth in S&P 500 capital spending came from 10 companies alone.For example, Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) alarmed investors in April by disclosing more than $7 billion of capital expenditures in the first quarter.Facebook (FB), under fire for its handling of the 2016 election, is spending heavily on people and technology.Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC) and Micron (MU) are also accelerating their capital spending.Even though CEOs continue to green light vast buybacks, they have been quietly taking a different approach with their own money.Corporate insiders sold $10.3 billion of shares in August, the most since November 2017, according to research firm TrimTabs.
Lehman Brothers: When the financial crisis spun out of control:::::New York (CNN Business) Legendary investment bank Lehman Brothers was on fire and no one was coming to put it out.Bank of America refused to rescue the 158-year-old Wall Street firm without support from Uncle Sam.The British government wouldn't let Barclays ( BCS ) buy Lehman Brothers and its toxic balance sheet.And Washington decided against another politically unpopular bailout.So Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail.At 1:45 a.m. on Monday, September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.What ensued was the largest and most complex bankruptcy in American history.But that doesn't do justice to the damage Lehman's demise caused the financial system.The implosion of Lehman Brothers and the mayhem it unleashed was the most terrifying moment for business and the US economy since the Great Depression."It was the moment when the financial crisis fully burst upon us, when panic seized the markets," Phil Angelides, who led the official bipartisan inquiry into the 2008 meltdown, told CNN.Lehman's failure shook Wall Street to its core.The Dow plummeted 504 points , the equivalent of 1,300 points today.Some $700 billion vanished from retirement plans and other investment funds.The panic that followed plunged the American economy into a severe downturn , now known as the Great Recession.Today, Lehman Brothers and its CEO Dick Fuld are the poster children for the reckless risk-taking that wrecked the economy.Frantic talks Lehman's final days were marked by frantic last-minute negotiations over its fate.Right up until the end, everyone thought someone would rescue Lehman Brothers: Surely the firm wouldn't be allowed to fail.Bear Stearns, a smaller investment bank, had been saved just six months earlier by Washington and JPMorgan Chase.On Wednesday, September 10, South Korea's Korean Development Bank dropped out of the running to be Lehman Brothers' white knight.The news combined with Lehman's announcement of a record $3.9 billion quarterly loss sent the bank's shares cratering 45%.With South Korea out, Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson called Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis to ask him to find a creative way to buy Lehman Brothers.Put on your "imagination hat," Paulson urged Lewis.But by Friday, September 12, Bank of America said it was bowing out unless the government was willing to help.Lehman was simply stuck with too many "illiquid" mortgage assets, and it couldn't sell them quickly enough to meet other obligations.Bank of America decided instead to buy the next investment bank in line to fail: Merrill Lynch."You just didn't know what was going to happen when you got into work on Monday," said Brady Kim, who worked as an analyst on Lehman's trading desk."Were you going to be working for Barclays?Some Korean conglomerate?"The one option few saw coming was bankruptcy."They're not just going to let the bank go under," Kim said.'Not a penny' That Friday evening, Paulson ordered the heads of the big Wall Street firms to meet at the New York Fed's headquarters.They were told to come up with a private-sector solution to save Lehman.American officials had little appetite for another bailout.They had just seized control of teetering mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac the weekend before.Fed officials said Paulson made it clear there would be no government help this time, "not a penny."I never thought the company would go out of business."James Chico, former Lehman Brothers analyst Saturday brought an apparent breakthrough for Lehman: Barclays agreed to buy Lehman as long as Wall Street would take some assets off its hands.But the Barclays deal went up in smoke on Sunday when UK regulators balked at blessing the risky deal."Imagine if I said yes to a British bank buying a very large American bank which ... collapsed the following week," Alistair Darling, the UK's chancellor of the exchequer, later told the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.'It was pandemonium up there' With no buyers left, regulators pressured Lehman Brothers to file for bankruptcy on Sunday night, before trading opened in the morning.Lehman's lawyers and executives left the New York Fed to inform the board that no rescue was coming."We went back to the headquarters, and it was pandemonium up there," Harvey Miller, the bankruptcy counselor for Lehman Brothers, later told investigators.The Fed rejected a last-minute Lehman plea for additional assistance from the central bank, leading to the early-morning bankruptcy.The collapse shocked employees."I never thought the company would go out of business.It was terrible," said James Chico, who worked as an analyst in the back office at Lehman for more than two decades.Tom Rogers was on his honeymoon in St. Lucia when the bank, his employer for seven years, went bust."I came back, and it was just mass chaos," said Rogers, who started as an intern at Lehman and moved up to senior analyst in the firm's reinsurance business.'Cataclysmic proportions' The turmoil showed just how fragile and interconnected the entire system was.The situation was exacerbated by the near-collapse of AIG, the insurance behemoth.Regulators feared AIG's demise would bring down the whole system so AIG was given a $182 billion bailout.Fear and panic quickly spread through the financial system, causing credit markets to freeze.Even large and iconic industrial companies such as General Motors were unable to receive short-term funding."The financial crisis reached cataclysmic proportions with the collapse of Lehman Brothers," the crisis inquiry commission concluded.Fuld, who had infamously told shareholders in April 2008 that "the worst is behind us," emerged as one of the villains of the crisis.He steered Lehman right into the face of an epic storm.Between 2000 and 2007, Lehman's assets had more than tripled to $691 billion.And its borrowing ratio, known as leverage, jumped to 40 times its shareholders' equity in the company.The firm had relatively little capital to protect against trouble.Madelyn Antoncic, Lehman's chief risk officer from 2004 to 2007, tried and failed to warn Fuld against taking on more mortgage risk."At the senior level, they were trying to push so hard that the wheels started to come off," Antoncic told the commission.For his part, Fuld told lawmakers in 2008 that the pain of Lehman's failure "will stay with me for the rest of my life."The former Lehman Brothers boss, who made and lost a $1 billion fortune on Wall Street, has made few public appearances since the crisis.He did speak at a 2015 event where he admitted he would do some things differently."I missed the violence of the market and how it spread from one asset class to the next," Fuld said.Richard Fuld, former chairman and chief executive officer of Lehman Brothers, speaks during a hearing in 2010.Where were the regulators?Fuld doesn't deserve all the blame.The firm's demise underscored the wild risk-taking that regulators and CEOs had allowed to become rampant across Wall Street.Consider, for example, the 2000 deregulation of exotic financial instruments known as derivatives.Regulators had little window into how these trades linked banks to one another.When one bank failed, other financial institutions fell in a kind of domino effect.Even a month before Lehman's bankruptcy, officials at the Fed were still seeking information on the bank's 900,000 derivative contracts.And they were clueless about the risk posed by AIG's enormous book of derivatives."The people charged with overseeing our financial system were flying blind as the crisis developed," Angelides said.Only in 2010, with the passage of the sweeping Dodd-Frank financial reform law, were derivatives required to be bought and sold on exchanges.Regulators also failed to get Lehman Brothers to slow its headfirst dive into mortgages.The firm kept buying real estate assets well into the first quarter of 2008.The Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision didn't issue a report warning of Lehman's "outsized bet" on commercial real estate until two months before its collapse.The OTS was abolished by Dodd-Frank."Our regulatory system is made of humans and humans make mistakes."James Angel, Georgetown University business professor Likewise, the SEC declined to call Lehman Brothers out for exceeding risk limits even though the agency was aware."The SEC...knew of the firm's disregard of risk management," the commission said.Lehman Brothers also got away with using accounting gimmicks to mask how much money it borrowed.Bart McDade, Lehman's president and chief operating officer, wrote in an email at the time that the accounting maneuvers are "another drug we R on."Should Lehman have been saved?Economists will debate for decades whether Washington should have rescued Lehman to prevent the chaos that followed.Former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke maintains that regulators had no authority to lend to a failing Lehman."We essentially had no choice and had to let it fail," Bernanke told the commission.But others say Bernanke and Paulson should have realized that allowing Lehman to fail would deepen the crisis."Our regulatory system is made of humans and humans make mistakes," said James Angel, a business professor at Georgetown University."The Fed clearly could have done a better job of containing the damage."The inconsistent response by Washington deciding not to rescue Lehman after saving Bear and before helping AIG "added to uncertainty and panic," the financial crisis inquiry concluded.Could it happen again?Today's financial system is safer thanks to the reforms put in place after 2008.Banks have bulked up on vast amounts of capital.Regulators are more vigilant.But some worry about the risk of another downturn , even if it doesn't start with banks."I'm concerned about now," said famed Yale professor Robert Schiller, pointing to "highly priced" stocks and rising home values."We're already in for what could be a repeat of 2008," Shiller said."It will look different this time, but there could be a decline in home prices and recession coming in."A Decade Later: It's been 10 years since the financial crisis rocked America's economy.In a special yearlong series, CNN will examine the causes of the crisis, how the country is still feeling its effects, and the lessons we have and have not learned.
These countries are most vulnerable to the emerging market storm:::::1.Trouble in paradise: For the past decade, a river of easy money rushed into emerging markets.Now that powerful force is reversing.Rising interest rates, along with trade wars, have started a stampede out of some emerging markets.The Turkish lira and Argentine peso have crashed, while China's stock market is stuck in a bear market.Problems long masked by extremely low interest rates are now coming into sharp focus."The tide ... is receding and some countries have been, or will be, caught naked," Jason Daw, head of emerging markets strategy at Societe Generale, wrote to clients last week.Developing economies may not get relief anytime soon.The Federal Reserve is expected to keep steadily lifting interest rates off the floor.The rate hikes represent a vote of confidence in the strong American economy, which continues to prop up US stocks.However, the end of easy money along with a surge of trade tensions is causing serious headaches in other parts of the world.Higher rates strengthen the US dollar, making it more difficult for countries like Turkey that took out a ton of dollar-denominated debt.Moreover, the rate hikes have lured money that had flocked to far-flung places back to the United States.But not all emerging markets are feeling the pain equally.Some, like South Korea and Thailand, seem to be weathering the storm relatively well.That's a huge flip from two decades ago, when an Asian financial crisis began with the implosion of the Thai baht.Others, like Turkey, have gotten crushed.The Turkish central bank had to resort to a surprisingly strong interest rate hike last week to stem the bleeding in the lira.Argentina's central bank hiked interest rates to 60%.The central bank of Russia, which has been hammered by sanctions from Washington, surprised investors on Friday with the first interest rate hike since 2014.South Africa's central bank, which meets on Thursday, could be forced to do the same.Daw said that countries most susceptible to the emerging market stress have several things in common.First, they've piled on lots of dollar-denominated debt -- much of which is due soon.Second, they have relatively high overall levels of debt and low rainy-day funds.And these emerging markets are running trade and budget deficits.So which countries fit these categories?Daw called out Turkey, South Africa, Malaysia, India and Indonesia as the most vulnerable."The misallocation of capital following a decade of cheap money is starting to be exposed," Daw said.2.More earnings: It's a slower week for earnings, but some notable companies will post results, including Oracle, FedEx, General Mills, AutoZone and Olive Garden owner Darden Restaurants.The booming economy and lower tax rates have boosted corporate profits.3.New Apple products: Apple's new iPhone models hit store shelves on Friday.The company is also releasing iOS 12, Apple Watch and software updates to its HomePod and tvOS devices.Apple's (AAPL) stock is up 32% this year.4.S&P reclassification: The S&P 500 is undergoing some changes on Friday.A number of major tech and telecommunications stocks will move to the communication services unit, including Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL).5.Coming this week: Monday Oracle (ORCL) and FedEx (FDX) earnings; iOS 12 launches Tuesday General Mills (GIS) and AutoZone (AZO) earnings; US Treasury foreign bond ownership stats Thursday Darden (DRI) Restaurants and Micron Technology (MU) earnings Friday S&P reclassification; new iPhones and Apple Watch hit stores

Barnes & Noble stock soars 20% as it explores a sale:::::This story originally published on October 3, 2018.New York (CNN Business) Barnes & Noble stock jumped more than 20% after the board said it would consider a sale of the troubled company.The board said Wednesday it had appointed a special committee to review offers.One came from longtime Barnes & Noble chairman Len Riggio.He is the company's largest shareholder, controlling close to 20%.Barnes & Noble ( BKS ) also disclosed that a shareholder it could not identify had rapidly built up a stake in the company.To block a hostile takeover, Barnes & Noble's board of directors approved what's known as a poison pill.The poison pill will kick in if the unidentified party accumulates 20% of the stock or more.At that point, shareholders will be allowed to buy Barnes & Noble's stock at a 50% discount, diluting the value of the shares.The announcement comes shortly after another investor disclosed a stake of close to 7%, and said he had held talks with Riggio about buying the company.Read More

Honda teams up with GM on self-driving cars:::::New York (CNN Business) Honda and General Motors are teaming up to create a new generation of fully autonomous vehicles.Honda will invest $2 billion over 12 years into GM's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, Cruise.GM and Cruise have been building and developing self-driving versions of GM's Chevrolet Bolt EV electric car with plans to deploy a fleet of them for public use next year.With Honda's engineering and financial assistance, Cruise will begin developing a new vehicle that is not based on any existing car, the companies said.It will represent the next step in autonomous driving, one in which controls for human operation are entirely absent."This is a purpose-built vehicle that will be the first vehicle produced at scale that is freed from the constraints of vehicle design and having a driver at the wheel," said GM president Donald Amman.Amman gave no precise timing on when Cruise Automation's self-driving vehicles will be shuttling members of the general public, either in the Bolt EV or the new car.The cars will be deployed only when it has been decided they are safe enough, Amman enough.The Japanese tech-focused investment bank Softbank recently invested $2.25 billion in Cruise , and Honda took a $750 million equity stake.Together, the Honda and Softbank investments give Cruise a total value of $14.6 billion.Read More
Aston Martin falls 5% in London IPO:::::Aston Martin is joining the ranks of listed automakers with an IPO that values the British company at more than $5 billion.But its first day of trading in London got off to a rocky start.The favorite carmaker of fictional British secret service agent James Bond priced its shares at 19.00 ($24.70), giving it a valuation of 4.3 billion ($5.6 billion).The final listing price is 16% below the top of the range that Aston Martin had targeted, reflecting investor doubts about whether the carmaker should be valued in the same league as Italian rival Ferrari.Shares dipped nearly 5% in London trading.In going public, the British company is asking investors to overcome fears about US threats to tax foreign autos and the potential for Britain's planned exit from the European Union to disrupt supply chains and markets.Aston Martin, which has a history of bankruptcy filings, is now producing healthy profits.It sold more than 5,000 cars in 2017, its best performance in nine years.That generated record revenue of 876 million ($1.1 billion), an increase of nearly 50% over the previous year.Earnings for the first half of this year show that momentum has continued.Revenue was up 8% over the same period a year earlier, while profit increased 14%, according to the numbers that were published last month.Aston Martin has in recent years sought to capitalize on its high-end brand.But analysts at Bernstein see several potential problems.They argue the Aston Martin brand is not as strong as that of Ferrari (RACE), which is bolstered by decades of racing history and a slew of Formula 1 championships.The British automaker also has much tighter margins than its Italian rival and a worrying history of uneven sales.With money raised from the IPO earmarked for existing shareholders rather than investment in the company, Aston Martin executives could be pinning too much hope on the success of a planned SUV."Given its current financials and apparently rather less robust demand, it's a big stretch for us to see how it can possibly match Ferrari's profitability," analysts at Bernstein wrote recently."We can't see it getting anywhere close."Aston Martin's owners include Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler (DDAIF), private equity firm Investindustrial and investors based in Kuwait.
Tesla calms fears with strong sales numbers:::::New York (CNN Business) A tumultuous quarter at Tesla ended with some very good sales numbers.The company delivered 83,500 vehicles during the third quarter, a strong performance that should calm investor fears about logistical problems and a looming cash crunch.That included almost 56,000 of the lower-priced Model 3.Production was a bit below that number: Tesla said it built about 53,000 Model 3s.But that was within the company's projections.Only three months ago, the company struggled to build 5,000 Model 3s in a week, a long-delayed target.Tesla did not maintain that pace, but production was still high enough to keep the company on track to turn a sustained profit for the first time.Tesla was sorely in need of good news.
S&P downgrades debt-riddled GE and GE Capital:::::New York (CNN Business) New General Electric boss Larry Culp just got a fresh reminder of the debt-riddled balance sheet he's inheriting.Barely 24 hours after Culp became CEO , S&P Global Ratings downgraded the credit ratings of GE ( GE ) and GE Capital.Moody's and Fitch warned they could do the same.All three ratings firms cited GE's elevated leverage and shrinking cash flows -- an alarming trend exacerbated by serious problems at GE's power division.GE said on Monday that plunging profit at GE Power will cause the parent company to miss targets in 2018.S&P pointed to "deep near-term challenges" at GE Power, which has been hurt by the shift towards renewable energy.More recently, GE disclosed mechanical problems with its gas turbines.Culp surely has a long to-do list as he starts work as the first outsider CEO in GE's history .But at the top of the list must be repairing GE's once-sturdy balance sheet.GE had a perfect AAA credit rating as recently as 2009.S&P lowered it on Tuesday from "A" to "BBB+".Underscoring the scale of the problem, Moody's said that GE's "very elevated leverage" could lead it to downgrade the company's rating by multiple notches.Ratings downgrades can make it more expensive for companies to borrow money.The good news is that S&P updated its outlook on GE to "stable" because the firm expects leverage and cash flow will improve in the coming years.But GE's finances have deteriorated further.S&P listed the dividend as one of several levers Culp could pull to reduce debt.In a statement, GE said it has a "sound liquidity position" that includes cash and operating credit lines.Repeating comments made by Culp on Monday, GE said it remains "committed to strengthening the balance sheet including deleveraging."Now that he's in charge, Culp will need to decide if he wants to go forward with former CEO John Flannery's plans to break-up GE.Flannery's turnaround plan included exiting various businesses, including oil and gas, health care and the century-old railroad division.Proceeds from the sales would then be used towards paying down debt.
Amazon announces $15 minimum wage for all US employees:::::New York (CNN Business) Amazon is raising its minimum wage to $15 an hour for all US employees.The change takes effect November 1 and applies to full-time, part-time and temporary workers.Amazon ( AMZN ) says the $15 minimum wage will benefit more than 250,000 Amazon employees, plus 100,000 seasonal workers."We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead," said Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO."We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us."The change applies to Whole Foods and all other subsidiary employees.Amazon also said its public policy team will begin lobbying for an increase in the federal minimum wage, which has been $7.25 an hour since 2009."We'll leave it to Congress and professionals to decide what the right number is," Dave Clark, the company's senior vice president of worldwide operations, told CNN's Christine Romans."But for us, that number is $15."The size and explosive growth of Amazon give the decision importance far beyond the hundreds of thousands of people who will benefit directly.Amazon is among the largest employers in the United States, and it has added more American jobs in the past decade than any other company.The decision also raises the stakes for potential workers at Amazon's next headquarters.The company is planning to create a second headquarters, known as HQ2, with as many as 50,000 jobs.Amazon has named 20 cities as finalists , including Atlanta, Chicago and Washington, D.C. "I want to give credit where credit is due," Sanders said on Tuesday."I want to congratulate Mr. Bezos for doing exactly the right thing."He said he looked forward to working with Bezos to push for a $15 federal minimum.Bezos responded by thanking the senator."We're excited about this, and also hope others will join in," he wrote in a tweet.Thank you @SenSanders.We're excited about this, and also hope others will join in.https://t.co/kasWkkOhWo Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) October 2, 2018 Workers across the country have pushed for a $15 minimum wage, most notably as part of the movement known as Fight for $15.Supporters say it's a remedy for widening wage inequality and will boost consumer spending, while opponents counter that it could reduce opportunities for employment, particularly for teenagers and others looking for entry level or low-skilled jobs.Some companies have responded to the public pressure.Target raised its minimum wage for new hires to $12 an hour in September and plans to raise its minimum to $15 by the end of 2020.Disney reached a deal with its unions to pay a minimum of $15 an hour at Disneyland in California in 2019 and at Disney World in Florida by 2021.And Walmart, the country's largest private-sector employer, which has more than 1 million US workers, raised its minimum wage to $11 in February.Clark said that Amazon wanted to make its change sooner."We decided, why wait?We should really do this now," he told Romans.Paul Sonn, state policy program director for the National Employment Law Project, said Amazon's announcement would put pressure on other companies to raise pay, and on Congress to lift the national minimum.Twenty-nine states have their own minimum wages higher than the federal $7.25.Neil Saunders, managing director of the consultancy GlobalData Retail, said that higher minimum pay could also help Amazon recruit workers."Without a rise in wages, Amazon would be placing itself at a disadvantage in the labor market," Saunders said.The company's rapid growth requires "a lot of recruitment which is becoming increasingly difficult in a tight labor market," he said."This is especially so over the holiday season."Saunders added that the decision was "politically savvy."Last month, Amazon said that the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in its fulfillment centers was already more than $15 per hour.Amazon median pay last year was $28,446, according to a company filing.That comes to $13.68 an hour.The company noted that the figure includes international and part-time employees.The company also announced that it is increasing the minimum wage for UK employees starting November 1.The new minimum wage is 10.50 ($13.60) for the London area and 9.50 ($12.30) for the rest of the country.More than 37,000 employees, including seasonal workers, will be affected by the change.The current UK minimum wage for adults over 25 is 7.83 ($10.15).
Volkswagen dumps jailed Audi CEO amid emissions probe:::::London (CNN) Volkswagen has severed ties with suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler, who has been jailed since June in connection with an emissions investigation.Stadler has left the board of management of Audi parent company Volkswagen ( VLKAF ) and stepped down as chairman of the premium brand's management board, the autos group said in a statement Tuesday."Due to his ongoing pretrial detention, he is unable to fulfill his duties as a member of the board of management and wishes to concentrate on his defense," the statement said of Stadler.Munich prosecutors said in June that Stadler, who has worked for Volkswagen since 1990, had been detained because of concerns he could influence witnesses in an ongoing investigation He is the highest ranking Volkswagen executive to be arrested in connection to a costly diesel emissions scandal that burst into public view in 2015.Volkswagen previously said that Stadler would be considered innocent until proven guilty.Audi tapped its top sales executive to lead the company after Stadler was detained.The German carmaker has admitted that it rigged millions of diesel engines to cheat on emissions tests.Diesel cars from Volkswagen and its Audi subsidiary cheated on clean air rules with software that made emissions look less toxic than they actually were.The scandal sent its share price plunging, and trashed confidence among consumer and regulators in diesel technology.The episode has already cost Volkswagen more than $30 billion in recalls, legal penalties and settlements.In a separate announcement on Tuesday, Volkswagen said it would offer incentives to customers in Germany who wanted to swap older diesel cars for cleaner models.Martin Winterkorn, the former chief executive officer of Volkswagen, was indicted by US prosecutors in May .He was charged with wire fraud, and conspiracy to defraud American customers and violate the Clean Air Act.Matthias Mueller, who was brought in to replace Winterkorn, stepped down earlier this year and was replaced by BMW ( BMWYY ) veteran Herbert Diess.Diess acknowledged at a press conference in April that Volkswagen had "lost a great deal of trust," and that it would take years to restore public confidence in the automaker.
Goldman Sachs slants research to help Democrats, top White House adviser says:::::New York (CNN Business) Kevin Hassett, one of President Donald Trump's top economic advisers, suggested that Goldman Sachs may be slanting its economic research to help Democrats ahead of the midterm elections.The Goldman Sachs economics team "almost at times looks like the Democratic opposition," Hassett told CNN's Poppy Harlow on Tuesday.The comment came after Harlow asked Hassett about a Goldman Sachs research report warning that a 25% US tariff on all imports from China could wipe out corporate profit growth in 2019.Hassett said he hadn't read the research, but went on to criticize Goldman's track record.Hassett claimed its analysis of last year's tax cuts was "really, really wrong and timed in a partisan way."He said Goldman's analysis predicted the tax cuts would be "really harmful" to the economy or have little impact before jacking up its forecast after they passed."So maybe they're just trying to make a partisan point before the elections," said Hassett, chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers.
Tencent Music plans to public on US exchange:::::This story originally published on October 2, 2018.New York (CNN Business) Tencent Music has filed plans to go public in the United States in what could be one of the biggest recent US IPOs by a Chinese company.That amount would mark the third largest Chinese IPO to list in the United States since the beginning of 2018, according to data provider Dealogic.The Netflix-like video platform iQIYI raised $2.3 billion and social shopping app Pinduoduo raised $1.6 billion.Tencent Music dominates the music streaming market in China through its Spotify-like apps.The company revealed in its SEC filing that its music apps have more than 800 million monthly active users.Spotify owns a 9% stake in Tencent Music The entertainment subsidiary of Tencent reported a profit of $263 million for the first six months of 2018, with revenue of $1.3 billion.Read More
Meet GE's new boss: Can Larry Culp right the ship?:::::New York (CNN Business) General Electric is turning to an outsider to clean up a mess that took decades to create.Larry Culp, 55, is a proven leader known for his hands-on approach.He received a hero's welcome from Wall Street on Monday after suddenly being installed as GE's new boss.GE's ( GE ) beaten-down share price spiked 10%.Culp, who became CEO of industrial manufacturer Danaher at just 37, faces a monumental task in restoring GE to greatness .The iconic maker of light bulbs, MRI machines and jet engines is bleeding badly from poorly timed deals , needless complexity in its corporate structure and mounting debt.Nearly half a trillion dollars has evaporated from GE's market value over the past 18 years.That's roughly the size of Facebook ( FB ).GE, a company that prides itself on management excellence, is so desperate that for the first time in its 126-year history it is being led by an outsider."GE has been like watching a slow (but fatal) train wreck," Scott Davis, lead analyst at Melius Research, wrote to clients on Monday."Unwinding 15 years of bad decisions will require courage," but Davis added: "I wouldn't want to bet against Larry."Culp brings credibility By bringing in fresh blood, GE is betting that it will be able to accelerate a turnaround plan started under John Flannery, a 30-year veteran of the company who was unceremoniously ousted as CEO to make room for Culp."GE should be commended for selecting a credible, seasoned GE outsider," Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote to clients.Culp is likely to "more candidly and quickly identify how bad things may be."Culp built an impressive track record while leading Danaher between 2001 and 2015.The company's revenue and market cap quintupled over that time.It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited."Jeff Sonnenfeld, Yale School of Management professor The Harvard Business School graduate is credited with remaking Danaher from a tired manufacturer into a modern company with strong health sciences and technology businesses.He pushed Danaher into health care, a business that today sells tools, lights and software used by dentists."He's got the chops to take over a company of this size," said Jim Corridore, an analyst who covers GE at CFRA Research.'Disturbing' writedown Khanna cheered Culp's history of "prudent" capital allocation at Danaher, noting that roughly $25 billion was deployed during his tenure.After years of bad decisions that caused a buildup of debt, GE sorely needs a strong steward of its depleted resources.Analysts say that under former CEO Jeff Immelt GE far too often bought high and sold low.Consider the disastrous 2015 purchase of Alstom, a $9.5 billion acquisition that pushed GE Power further into fossil fuels at precisely the wrong time.GE Power is in such disarray today that the company announced it will need to take an accounting write down of up to $23 billion to reflect the deterioration of businesses acquired."The size of the writedown is disturbing," said Corridore.Flannery took over a company in disarray when he became CEO last year.While he deserves credited for disclosing "dirty laundry" he uncovered, Flannery failed to move fast enough to restore confidence among shareholders."It was really hard for John Flannery to escape the bad hand he inherited," said Jeff Sonnenfeld, an authority on corporate governance at the Yale School of Management.In a statement, Immelt predicted that GE Power will recover under the new leadership team because of its superior technology and talent."Larry Culp will be a strong leader for GE and its board of directors.His expertise and experience are aligned perfectly with GE's needs," Immelt said.Will GE continue its makeover?Now, Culp must decide whether to press forward with Flannery's turnaround plan.Culp joined GE's board in April, meaning he signed off on Flannery's push to remake the company around power, its booming aviation business and renewable energy.The makeover would require GE to get rid of its health care, railroad, light bulb and oil-and-gas businesses -- and use the proceeds to pay down debt.Given Culp's history in health care at Danaher, Sonnenfeld predicted that GE could decide to keep its own health care division.GE's vast corporate structure, built up over decades by Immelt and Welch, could get slimmed-down under Culp.Culp ran Danaher with less than 100 employees in the corporate office, and Davis said the new CEO will likely likely "strip corporate back to necessary functions and tear down all the fiefdoms."Tall challenge ahead But cost-cutting alone won't fix GE.Culp needs to quickly get to the bottom of the trouble at GE Power.Not only is the business facing a serious challenge from renewable energy, but blade failures that have emerged recently point to potential quality problems.GE also faces a large pension shortfall caused by years of inattention and low interest rates.And then there's the ghost of GE Capital, the financial arm that nearly killed GE a decade ago during the financial crisis.Culp will be charged with safely shrinking GE Capital while navigating landmines, such as WMC Mortgage, the defunct subprime mortgage business that is being investigated by the Justice Department.Elsewhere at GE Capital, Culp needs to stabilize the long-term care insurance portfolio that suffered a $6 billion loss in January.The news prompted an SEC investigation -- the second GE is currently facing.By hiring Culp, GE may have quickly improved its serious credibility problem on Wall Street.But don't be fooled: righting the ship will take much longer.

Stocks pop after new US-Canada-Mexico deal:::::New York (CNN Business) The stock market appears to like the new trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico.Stocks popped after all three countries agreed to an 11th hour deal to replace NAFTA.The Dow rose 193 points, a gain of 0.7%.The S&P 500 gained 0.4%, and the Nasdaq lost 0.1%.The United States also agreed to make concessions on some automobile tariffs for cars and trucks built in Canada and Mexico as part of the agreement, which replaces NAFTA and will be called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).Shares in major automakers rose on the news.GM gained 1.6%, and Ford climbed 0.8%.Fiat Chrysler rose 2.7%.Still, some market experts said investors may be overreacting to the USMCA deal.That's because the United States still faces another major trade battle."While the U.S. has reached a new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, growing trade conflict between China and the U.S. threatens economic growth in both countries," said David Kelly, chief global strategist with JPMorgan Funds, in a report Monday.Eric Winograd, senior economist with AB, also thinks that China-US tension will not be resolved this easily."The US relationship with China is much more complicated than its relationship with Canada.And of course the stakes are considerably higher when dealing with Chinathe Chinese have leverage over the US that Canada simply doesn't have," Winograd wrote, referring to China's ownership of US Treasury debt as well as the fact that it's a much bigger market for US exports."I certainly wouldn't rule out an agreement being reached with China, but I don't think that the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement provides a template that can be used in discussions with the Chinese," Winograd added."The US relationship with China is much more complicated than its relationship with Canada.And of course the stakes are considerably higher when dealing with China."Eric Winograd, senior economist with AB Others think that a US-China deal is inevitable, which makes the market's reaction to the USMCA agreement, a logical one."Many investors are betting there's room for a market friendly compromise after the US midterm elections in early November when the Chinese will have an incentive to deal to avoid the 25% tariff rate that kicks in on $200 billion in Chinese exports on January 1, 2019," wrote Alec Young, managing director of global markets research for FTSE Russell, in a report.Other market movers It's not just the trade deal helping move the markets.The surprise ouster of General Electric CEO John Flannery and a deal between Tesla and the SEC are also having a big effect.Shares of GE jumped 7% following the news that Flannery, who had only been CEO since August 2017, is being replaced by Larry Culp, a former head of industrial conglomerate Danaher.Culp, who joined GE's board in April, faces a difficult task in getting GE back on track.GE also announced Monday that it was taking a charge tied to its struggling GE Power unit.The stock had fallen 35% so far this year prior to Monday's surge.Tesla also rallied Monday after the electric car maker reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will require Elon Musk to step down as chairman but allow him to stay on as CEO.Shares of Tesla climbed 17%.The stock plunged 14% Friday on the news that the SEC had filed a lawsuit accusing Musk of making "false and misleading statements" earlier this summer when he tweeted that he had "funding secured" for a deal to take Tesla private.
Goldman Sachs' new CEO has a lot of work to do:::::New York (CNN Business) It's a new era at Goldman Sachs.David Solomon, the part-time electronic dance DJ who previously served as president of the company and co-head of its investment banking division, took the reins from Lloyd Blankfein on Monday as CEO.Blankfein, who had served as CEO since 2006 and will stay on as chairman through the end of the year, is already thinking about his next chapter , which could include more "unrestrained tweeting."He started weighing in on issues including climate change and immigration toward the end of his tenure."I might venture forward on opinions that are my own opinions, without any regard for whether they serve the constituencies and the interests of Goldman Sachs," Blankfein said in a sit-down with Solomon posted Monday to social media.His successor has plenty to do.The bank's stock is down more than 11% this year .It has underperformed peers, weighed down by an inconsistent trading division that doesn't mint money the way it used to.Recruitment and retention of top talent remains vital, as does the development of newer lines of business, such as Marcus, Goldman's nascent retail banking venture.Here's what tops Solomon's to-do list.Trading division troubles Solomon's first order of business is to turn around Goldman's trading desk, which collects client fees to buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodities and currencies."The trading business is really what has hurt them in the past couple of years," said King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco.The unit made up more than half the bank's revenue in 2012, but shrank to just over a third last year, as a calm market and low interest rates pushed investors toward lower-fee index funds and passive funds.Goldman's trading side showed resilience last quarter, but not because of stocks.Revenue from bond, currency and commodities trading surged 45% from a year ago, while revenue from equities stayed stagnant.Solomon is willing to make changes.Last month, he installed Marty Chavez , the outgoing CFO, as co-lead of the struggling division.At a conference hosted by Sanford C. Bernstein in May, Solomon said that Goldman wasn't sitting around "waiting for the environment to change," and that the firm will keep investing in technology for trading.Diversity and talent Solomon is making his presence felt with other leadership changes.Stephen Scherr, who had been in charge of the consumer bank, is stepping into the CFO role.John Waldron, a longtime deputy of Solomon's, will take over as president and chief operating officer."The question is: How does his new team jell together?"said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research.Another challenge for Solomon will be attracting and keeping talent at the firm.Many young professionals have favored Silicon Valley over Wall Street in recent years, as tech companies entice college graduates with competitive pay and relaxed work environments.Goldman has loosened up, with results to show for it.Roughly two-thirds of employees are Millennials, while more than 25% are engineers.Still, the company must ramp up diversity efforts that started under Blankfein, Lip said.Solomon has signaled this is a priority.This summer, more women were added to the 33-person management committee.Goldman also said it had formed a committee to promote the careers of diverse business leaders at the company.Changing course As trading becomes a less reliable source of income, and many competitors scale up, Solomon's Goldman is expected to explore new ways to grow its business."The supermarket finance business model is what's working well today, and Goldman is a lot [narrower]," Biggar said.Some of this work is underway.Last year, Goldman released a plan to boost revenue by $5 billion by 2020, in part by bulking up other parts of the company.And the firm has doubled down on its consumer arm, Marcus.Goldman, which launched Marcus in the United States in 2016, started to offer savings accounts in the UK last week.The bank may expand into life insurance, mortgages, auto loans and wealth management services down the road."We have the ambition to build a large, differentiated, highly profitable digital consumer finance platform," Solomon said in May.Solomon has been at the bank since 1999.He's expected to be a leader in Blankfein's mold, though his extracurricular interests certainly set him apart."This is not somebody they're bringing in from the outside that will radically alter the makeup of the company," Biggar said."I don't think anyone's expecting that.But there are things on the edges he could do."
California has a new law: No more all-male boards:::::New York (CNN Business) Companies headquartered in California can no longer have all-male boards.That's according to a new law, enacted Sunday, which requires publicly traded firms in the state to place at least one woman on their board of directors by the end of 2019 or face a penalty.It also requires companies with five directors to add two women by the end of 2021, and companies with six or more directors to add at least three more women by the end of the same year.It's the first such law on the books in the United States, though similar measures are common in European countries.The measure was passed by California's state legislature last month .And it was signed into law by Gov.Jerry Brown on Sunday, along with a trove of other bills that look to "protect and support women, children and working families," the governor's office said in a release
Instagram gets a new chief: Facebook vet Adam Mosseri:::::New York (CNN Business) Instagram has a new leader.On Monday, the company announced that Adam Mosseri will head Instagram effective immediately.Last week, Instagram founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger announced they would leave the company."We are thrilled to hand over the reins to a product leader with a strong design background and a focus on craft and simplicity as well as a deep understanding of the importance of community," Systrom and Krieger said in a statement.Mosseri -- who joined Facebook, which owns Instagram, in 2008 -- has held various roles at the company, including head of News Feed and design director for Facebook's mobile apps.Most recently, he was Instagram's VP of product.In his new role, Mosseri will oversee "all functions of the business" and will hire a new executive team, including a head of engineering, product and operations.Mike Krieger, Adam Mosseri and Kevin Systrom.Before their departures, Systrom was CEO and Krieger was the chief technology officer.Read More
Ryanair's strikes are hitting its profits and stock price:::::London (CNN Business) Ryanair could be headed for a rough landing this year.Europe's leading low cost airline slashed its profit forecast for the current fiscal year to between 1.1 billion ($1.27 billion) and 1.2 billion ($1.39 billion).That's about 150 million ($174 million) less than the company had expected.Ryanair ( RYAAY ) said that strikes and flight cancellations in September had resulted in lower traffic and higher costs.It warned that customer fears of further cancellations had led to reduced bookings, forcing the airline to cut fares in the third quarter.Shares in Ryanair dropped over 10% in London, leaving the stock down more than 22% so far this year.The company said it could slash its profit guidance further if the strikes continue.A sharp rise in fuel costs has also heaped pressure on the airline and its outspoken CEO Michael O'Leary , who is confronting labor unions after staff strikes forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights in recent months.Read More
Ahold says Stop&Shop strike will hurt 2019 margins:::::FILE PHOTO: Striking workers gather outside a Stop & Shop store following a speech by former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, a potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., April 18, 2019.REUTERS/Brian Snyder AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Ahold, the Dutch owner of supermarket chains in the United States and Europe, said on Monday a labor conflict at Stop&Shop in the U.S., now resolved, would hurt its underlying 2019 profit margins.In a statement Ahold said the 11-day strike earlier this month would cause a one-time reduction in underlying operating profit of around $100 million as a result of lost sales and inventory.As a consequence, Ahold Delhaize now anticipates underlying operating margin for the group for 2019 to be slightly lower than 2018, it said in a statement.Additionally, the percentage growth of underlying earnings per share in 2019 is revised from high single digits to low single digits.It kept free cash flow estimates unchanged at 1.8 billion euros, due to growth at its other chains in the U.S. and Europe.
Samsung retrieving all Galaxy Fold samples after defect reports: source:::::SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is retrieving all Galaxy Fold samples distributed to reviewers to investigate reports of broken screens, a day after it postponed the phones launch, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday.FILE PHOTO: The Samsung Galaxy Fold phone is shown on a screen at Samsung Electronics Co Ltds Unpacked event in San Francisco, California, U.S., Feb. 20, 2019 REUTERS/Stephen Nellis The retrieval comes as the worlds biggest smartphone maker met with embarrassment ahead of the foldable devices U.S. release on April 26, with a handful of technology journalists reporting breaks, bulges and blinking screens after a days use.The South Korean tech giant postponed the handsets launch for an unspecified period of time while it investigated the matter.It said initial findings showed the issues could be associated with impact on exposed areas of the hinges.A representative declined to comment further on Tuesday.Samsungs share price was 0.4 percent lower as of 0425 GMT, in a flat Seoul market.However, parts suppliers fell, with hinge maker KH Vatec Co Ltd shedding 3.1 percent.A person with direct knowledge of the supply chain said KH Vatec conducted an internal review of hinges used in the Galaxy Fold and found no defects.The supplier declined to comment.In March, Samsung released a video showing robots folding Galaxy Fold handsets 200,000 times for its durability test.Samsungs head of IT and mobile communications, DJ Koh, has repeatedly said foldables are the future of smartphones.Though the issue does not hurt Samsungs balance sheet, the postponement damages the firms effort to showcase itself as an innovative first mover, not a fast follower, analysts said.In some cases, reviewers had peeled off a layer of film which they mistook for a disposable screen protector.Its disastrous that Samsung sent samples to reviewers without clear instructions on how to handle the device, and that the firm needs to fix screen flickering, said analyst Kim Young-woo at SK Securities.One Samsung employee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, On the bright side, we have an opportunity to nail down this issue and fix it before selling the phones to a massive audience, so they wont have same complaints.Samsung emailed pre-order customers upon delaying the launch, online outlets said on Twitter.Your pre-order guarantees your place in the queue for this innovative technology, Samsung said in the email.Well update you with more specific shipping information in two weeks.
U.S. to end all waivers on imports of Iranian oil, crude price jumps:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday demanded that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, a move to choke off Tehrans oil revenues which sent crude prices to six-month highs on fears of a potential supply crunch.The Trump administration on Monday said it will not renew exemptions granted last year to buyers of Iranian oil, a more stringent than expected decision that caught several key importers who have been pleading with Washington to continue buying Iranian oil sanctions-free.The United States reimposed sanctions in November on exports of Iranian oil after U.S. President Donald Trump last spring unilaterally pulled out of a 2015 accord between Iran and six world powers to curb Tehrans nuclear program.Eight economies, including China and India, were granted waivers for six months, and several had expected those exemptions to be renewed.Tehran remained defiant, saying it was prepared for the end of waivers, while the Revolutionary Guards repeated a threat to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major oil shipment channel in the Gulf, Iranian media reported.The White House said it was working with top oil exporters Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to ensure the market was adequately supplied.Traders, already fretting about tight supplies, raised skepticism about whether this more stringent approach, along with ongoing sanctions on Venezuelas oil industry, could backfire in the form of a major spike in prices.It is a surprise that the requirement to cease importing Iranian oil should come at this next May deadline, said Elizabeth Rosenberg, director of the energy, economics and security program at Washington-based Center for a New American Security.Having only several weeks notice before the deadline means there are lots of cargoes booked for May delivery.This means that it will now be harder to get it out by the deadline.Irans oil exports have dropped to about 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from more than 2.5 million bpd prior to the re-imposition of sanctions.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a briefing Monday, said were going to zero across the board, saying the United States had no plans for a grace period for compliance beyond May 1.The White House intends to deprive Iran of its lifeline of $50 billion in annual oil revenues, Pompeo said, as it pressures Tehran to curtail its nuclear program, ballistic missile tests and support for conflicts in Syria and Yemen.A senior administration official said President Donald Trump was confident Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will fulfill their pledges to compensate for the shortfall in the oil market.U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources Frank Fannon said Riyadh was taking active steps to ensure global oil markets were well supplied.Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, in a statement on Monday, did not commit to raising production, saying it was monitoring the oil market developments after the U.S. statement, and that it would coordinate with other oil producers to ensure a balanced market.OPEC is next scheduled to meet in June.While Saudi Arabia is expected to boost output again, analysts fear the U.S. move - along with sanctions on Venezuela - will leave the world with inadequate spare capacity.The international Brent crude oil benchmark rose to more than $74 a barrel on Monday, the highest since November, due to the uncertainty surrounding increased supply from Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations, while U.S. prices hit a peak of $65.92 a barrel, the highest since October 2018.Despite high and fast-rising oil prices and high geopolitical disruption risk, (Trump) is betting the farm that Saudi Arabia and the UAE will contain upward price pressure by more than offsetting Iranian oil, said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, an energy consultancy.In addition to China and India, the economies of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Italy and Greece had also been granted waivers.FILE PHOTO: A gas flare on an oil production platform in the Soroush oil fields is seen alongside an Iranian flag in the Persian Gulf, Iran, July 25, 2005.REUTERS/Raheb Homavandi/File Photo/File Photo QUESTIONS ABOUT WORLD SUPPLY Trump has been clear to his national security team in recent weeks he wants the waivers to end and national security adviser John Bolton has been working on that within the administration.One thing that has clearly been going on inside the administration is a debate about when they should get to zero, said Rosenberg.In recent months, Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have cut supply dramatically.OPEC, along with ally Russia and others, agreed to reduce output by 1.2 million bpd, but they have exceeded those benchmarks, with Saudi Arabia alone reducing supply by 800,000 bpd.While Italy, Greece and Taiwan already have halted purchases, doing so could prove much more challenging for China and India.Turkey, another buyer, already has slammed the U.S. decision.We had indicated privately that zero was coming and now were here, a senior administration official said on Monday, referencing Turkeys concerns.Geng Shuang, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, said at a daily news briefing in Beijing on Monday that it opposed unilateral U.S. sanctions against Iran and that Chinas bilateral cooperation with Iran was in accordance with the law.South Koreas Yonhap news agency quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying the South Korean government had been negotiating with the United States at all levels to extend the waivers and that it would continue to make every effort to reflect Seouls position until the May deadline.In India, refiners have started a search for alternative supplies but the government declined to comment officially.Slideshow (2 Images) A spokesman for the Japanese embassy in Washington said Tokyo was not planning to comment on the decision but Japanese officials say the Iran issue was discussed at a meeting between the Japanese foreign minister and Pompeo last Friday.It is also expected to come up during a visit to Washington this Friday by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, which is expected to focus on North Korea and the challenge posed by Chinas rise.(GRAPHIC: Asia's Iranian crude oil imports link: here
India to get extra oil from major producers to make up for Iran oil loss: minister:::::FILE PHOTO: India's Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan speaks at a road show organised by the Directorate General of Hydrocarbon (DGH) in Mumbai, India, October 26, 2017.REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will get additional supplies from other major oil producing countries to compensate for the loss of Iranian oil, Indias Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Tuesday.The United States on Monday demanded that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, ending six months of waivers which had allowed Irans eight biggest buyers, most of them in Asia, to continue to import limited volumes.Pradhan said on Twitter that India has put in place a robust plan for adequate supply of crude oil to refineries.Indian refineries are fully prepared to meet the national demand for petrol, diesel and other petroleum products, he said.Reuters last week reported that Indian refiners are increasing their planned purchases from the nations of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mexico and the United States to hedge against loss of Iranian oil.Refiners in India, the worlds third-biggest oil importer and Irans top oil client after China, had almost halved their Iranian oil purchases since November when petroleum sanctions went into effect.At the time, the United States granted waivers from sanctions, known as significant reduction exceptions (SRE), for six months to countries that purchased some amounts of Iranian crude, including India.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations could more than make up for any drop in Iranian oil supplies to global markets now that the waivers are ended.Saudi Arabia, the worlds biggest oil exporter, said on Monday it would coordinate with other oil producers to ensure an adequate crude supply and a balanced market.
Goldman says removal of Iran oil sanctions waivers to have limited impact:::::The ticker symbol and logo for Goldman Sachs is displayed on a screen on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 18, 2018.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs expects the United States decision to end waivers from sanctions on imports of Iranian oil to have a limited impact on prices, even though the timing of the halt is much more sudden than expected.While we acknowledge the near-term upside price risks, we reiterate our fundamentally derived Brent price trading range of $70-75 per barrel for the second quarter of 2019, the bank wrote in a note on Monday.The United States on Monday demanded that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, a move to choke off Tehrans oil revenues.In response, crude prices rose to six-month highs on fears of a potential supply crunch.[O/R] The bank still expects declining prices into 2020 due to better supplied markets next year and high uncertainties around whether the Organziation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and fellow producers will continue to abide by their agreement to curb output to support prices after June.The U.S. investment bank sees Iranian production declining by 900,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared to the immediately available global spare capacity of 2 million bpd, which is set to grow further later this year.The U.S. policy announcement should support Middle East Dubai crude prices relative to Brent prices given the quality mismatch between the lost Iran volumes and the lighter compensating crudes from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, it added.
Starbucks' China challenger Luckin to raise up to $800 million in U.S. IPO: sources:::::HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Luckin Coffee Inc, the Chinese challenger to Starbucks Corp, filed on Monday for a U.S. initial public offering (IPO) through which, sources said, it is looking to raise up to $800 million.FILE PHOTO: The logo is seen next to a customer at a Luckin Coffee store in Beijing, China, February 28, 2019.REUTERS/Jason Lee The Beijing-based coffee chain set a placeholder amount of $100 million to indicate the size of the IPO and did not disclose the number of shares it would offer, a filing bit.ly/2UtnC0g with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed.Two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters the startup is potentially looking to raise $500 million to $800 million from the listing which is scheduled to take place in May.An amount raised in that range would make Luckin the biggest U.S. IPO by a Chinese firm so far in 2019, according to Refinitiv data.Another source said the loss-making company is aiming for a valuation of between $4 billion to $5 billion, a significant jump from $2.9 billion following its latest fundraising of $150 million that was announced last week.Luckin Coffee, which has been expanding at breakneck speed, currently operates 2,370 stores in 28 Chinese cities and plans to open 2,500 new stores this year with the goal of displacing Starbucks as Chinas largest coffee chain in the process.The brand is banking on an increase in coffee consumption in China which, according to a report cited by Luckin in the prospectus, has almost doubled to 8.7 billion cups last year from 4.4 billion in 2013 and is expected to further rise to 15.5 billion cups by 2023.However, the company is still loss making and has warned that it could continue to incur losses in the foreseeable future.Since inception on June 16, 2017, the company has been in the red, with net loss to shareholders at $475.4 million last year, and total revenue of $125.27 million, according to the filing.For the first three months of this year, it posted a net loss of $85.3 million.REWRITING RULES Luckin has waged its cash-burning caffeine war with generous subsidies, speedy delivery and viral promotions on social media, which in turn has also pushed Starbucks to form a tie-up with local tech giant Alibaba to deliver coffee to customers.According to the prospectus, its acquisition cost per new customer decreased to 16.9 yuan ($2.52) in the first quarter of 2019 from 103.5 yuan in the year-ago quarter, helped by the growth of its network and improved brand recognition.It has also expanded outside coffee, allowing customers to purchase food and other beverages such as grapefruit cheese jasmine tea and Sichuan cold noodles with pulled chicken via its app.The big question for the brand long term is if, when it rolls back discounts, enough customers stick around, said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.But the company has completely rewritten the rules for the coffee business in China and has impacted Starbucks as well as a host of smaller players.The coffee chain was co-founded by Chief Executive Qian Zhiya, the former chief operating officer of car rental firm Car Inc, and two other senior executives, and it is backed by Singapores sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd. Other investors in the company include U.S. money manager BlackRock Inc, and Chinese investment firms Centurium Capital and Joy Capital.The company, which intends to list under the symbol LK on Nasdaq, chose New York for the listing as Hong Kong generally requires IPO applicants to have a track record of three financial years, sources told Reuters earlier.Another reason is that Luckin looks to benchmark itself against Seattle-based Starbucks in terms of valuation, sources have told Reuters.The size of the IPO stated in preliminary filings is used to calculate registration fees.The final IPO size could be different.CICC, Credit Suisse, Haitong International and Morgan Stanley are the underwriters to the IPO.
Electric vehicle study sees opportunity for utilities:::::FILE PHOTO: A Tesla electric car supercharger station is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. August 2, 2018.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson (Reuters) - Increasing demand for electric vehicles in the United States over the next decade will create revenue opportunities for electric utilities that invest in greater grid capacity and offer EV charging and related services, according to a study released on Tuesday.The study, by the Boston Consulting Group, assumes a significant leap in consumer demand for electric vehicles, which continue to account for only a fraction of U.S. vehicle sales.BCG estimates that 20 to 30 percent of all U.S. new car sales by 2030 will be electric or hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles.Last year, plug-in hybrids and pure EVs accounted for just 2 percent of total U.S. car sales, according to the website InsideEVs.com.BCG predicted that up to 12 percent of all vehicles on U.S. roads will be plug-in hybrid or pure electric by 2030, stretching the capacity of the current grid when charging in certain locations or at certain times of day.The studys authors suggested that utilities consider expanding their range of services and explore such options as subscription services that impose a flat EV charging fee while providing customers with a free home charger that automatically charges a vehicle overnight and during periods of off-peak demand.Utilities also were urged to consider offering consulting services, as well as software solutions to both consumer and commercial customers for energy and fleet management.
Weak first quarter seen for U.S. refiners, but brighter summer expected:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. independent refiners are expected to roll out lower than expected first-quarter profits after a spate of outages, weak gasoline margins and a surge in the price of Canadian oil, according to analysts.FILE PHOTO: An aerial view of the Valero Houston Refinery is seen in Houston, Texas, U.S. August 31, 2017.REUTERS/Adrees Latif Major independent refiners cut production dramatically during the quarter, with some electing to undergo maintenance rather than produce barrels at a time when gasoline margins slumped.Several major U.S. refiners, including Valero Energy Corp, HollyFrontier Corp, and Marathon Petroleum Corp, are all expected to fall short of consensus estimates when they report results, according to Refinitiv Eikons SmartEstimate model, which values more recent revisions from higher-ranked analysts.However, reduced refining output in the early part of the year sets up the industry for a potential rebound as the critical summer months approach.With gasoline stockpiles at a four-year low on a seasonal basis, margins have rebounded in anticipation of driving season.U.S. refinery utilization dropped to 87.5 percent in early April, the lowest seasonally since 2014.Refiners had been running full-tilt for much of 2018, encouraged by strong demand for distillates.But in the process, they overproduced gasoline, tanking margins for the fuel along the way.Those margins fell to $3.64 a gallon in January, the lowest since 2009.They have since recovered, and were at about $23.00 a gallon on Monday, as inventories have fallen to about 228 million barrels from almost 260 million barrels in mid-January.Refiner earnings kick off this week with Valero on Friday.Since the beginning of April, analysts, on average, have revised projections for refiners lower by more than 5 percent, according to Refinitiv data.Analysts have sharply lowered estimates for Valero, Marathon and HollyFrontier, along with PBF Energy and Phillips 66, in the past month, putting them in the bottom quartile among U.S. companies in terms of revisions, according to Refinitiv data.On top of heavy maintenance, fires broke out at facilities over the last few months, including at Valeros Port Arthur, Texas, refinery, Exxon Mobil Corps Baytown, Texas, refinery and HollyFrontiers El Dorado, Kansas, refinery.HollyFrontier lowered the amount of crude it expected to process in the first quarter by 5,000 bpd.Analysts at Goldman Sachs downgraded the companys outlook last week on concerns that profits would take a hit after Canadian crude differentials collapsed.Sandy Fielden, director of commodities and energy research at Morningstar, said PBF also lost out because of the Canadian crude discount just disappearing.Canadian crude oil had been heavily discounted due to oversupply and lack of pipelines, but that discount eroded after the province of Alberta instituted production cuts.Western Canada Select (WCS) recently has traded around $9.25 a barrel under U.S. crude, compared with $15.65 at the beginning of the quarter.[CRU/CA] BUMPER BUNKER PROFITS?Some refiners decided to undergo heavier planned maintenance during the quarter to ready facilities for new low-sulfur marine fuel requirements.The new regulations required by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) are due to come into effect on Jan. 1, 2020 and could produce bumper profits.The rules outlaw high-sulfur fuels traditionally used for shipping - a boon for complex refineries that can break down products used by marine vessels into lower-sulfur products with higher margins.Refiners could now run their plants at higher rates to take advantage of the higher margins, and analysts expect gasoline inventories to climb through the remainder of the year as a result.
Asian stocks inch up but China falters; oil at 2019 highs:::::HONG KONG/TOKYO (Reuters) - Stocks in Asia rose marginally on Tuesday as many markets reopened after the long Easter break, while oil jumped to its highest this year as the United States tightened sanctions on Iran.FILE PHOTO: Visitors are seen as market prices are reflected in a glass window at the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) in Tokyo, Japan, October 1, 2018.REUTERS/Toru Hanai MSCIs broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.1 percent, while Japans Nikkei was little changed.Chinese stocks extended losses on concerns that Beijing will slow the pace of further policy easing after unexpectedly strong first-quarter economic data last week.Shares in Shanghai slid 0.4 percent after policymakers vowed to fine-tune monetary policy, ensuring it is neither too tight, nor too loose.Analysts believe Beijings message signaled a more tempered approach in easing policy amid worries about debt growth, and sent local stocks to their heaviest fall in almost four weeks on Monday.But Stefan Hofer, chief investment strategist at LGT Bank Asia in Hong Kong, said a market adjustment was expected.Chinas blue-chip stocks have surged over 30 percent so far this year on expectations of more stimulus and hopes that Beijing and Washington will soon reach a deal to end their bruising trade war.Weve had a fantastic run in Chinese equities year-to-date, some profit taking is completely normal.I dont think China is changing its policy that quickly, he said.On Wall Street, stocks hovered near break-even on Monday as the benchmark S&P 500 index was about 1 percent away from its record high hit in September, while the S&P energy index jumped on higher oil prices.Oil prices jumped more than 2 percent the previous day to a near six-month high, on growing concern about tight global supplies after the United States announced a further clampdown on Iranian oil exports.[O/R] Washington said it would eliminate in May all waivers allowing eight economies to buy Iranian oil without facing U.S. sanctions.International benchmark Brent crude soared 2.9 percent to settle at $74.04 a barrel on Monday and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude jumped 2.7 percent to settle at $65.70.Both indexes climbed to nearly six-month highs during the session.U.S. crude futures last traded at $65.87 per barrel, up 0.5 percent on the day.But sharp gains in oil prices have so far had a limited impact on the broader financial markets.Unless the WTI rises well above $70-75 per barrel, there will be limited impact on U.S. Treasuries and the dollar/yen, said Makoto Noji, chief currency and foreign bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities.Despite recent gains in oil prices, many investors still expect inflation to be well-contained in major economies including the United States, allowing the Federal Reserve to keep dovish stance.The worlds largest economy reported worse-than-expected fall in home sales on Monday, as rising demand continued to be frustrated by a lack of properties.The data is pointing to the Fed being as accommodative as possible, which, for Asian investors, is good news, said Jim McCafferty, Hong Kong-based head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan, at Nomura.In the currency market, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, eased 0.2 percent overnight and last traded steady at 97.303.The index hit a two-week high of 97.485 on Thursday, before the start of Good Friday and the Easter weekend.Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was 0.1 percent softer at 111.82 yen, while the euro was pretty much steady to the greenback at 1.1252.With the jump in the price of oil, one of Canadas major exports, the Canadian dollar rose 0.4 percent against its U.S. counterpart overnight and last traded at C$1.3359.On Monday, the Russian ruble hit its highest level against the euro in more than a year, and a one month-peak versus the dollar, also driven by the jump in oil.
Japan expects little impact from U.S. scrapping Iran oil waivers:::::TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan expects a limited impact from the U.S. decision not to renew waivers previously granted on Iran oil import sanctions, the countrys trade and industry minister said on Tuesday.Japan's Minister of Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko arrives at Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's official residence in Tokyo, Japan, August 3, 2017.REUTERS/Toru Hanai The United States on Monday demanded all buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, a move to choke off Tehrans oil revenues that sent benchmark crude prices to six-month highs.Japan is among a group of countries that were previously granted sanctions waivers.[O/R] Speaking at a regular press conference, Japans Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) Hiroshige Seko told reporters the government did not see any need to tap national oil reserves following the U.S. decision.Japan, the worlds fourth-biggest oil consumer, has been reducing its reliance on Iranian crude supplies.Iran now accounts for about 3 percent of purchases, Seko said.We will closely watch international oil markets and exchange views with Japanese companies involved in crude imports and may consider taking necessary measures, he said, declining to give details.The United States reimposed sanctions on exports of Iranian oil last November following U.S. President Donald Trumps move to unilaterally pull out of a 2015 accord between Iran and six world powers to curb Tehrans nuclear program.Eight economies, including China and India as well as Japan, were granted waivers for six months, and several had expected those exemptions to be renewed.Japanese refineries earlier put a halt on imports of Iranian oil after buying 15.3 million barrels between January and March ahead of the expiry of their sanctions waiver, according to industry sources and data on Refinitiv Eikon.The White House said it was working with top oil exporters Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to ensure the market was adequately supplied.Sultan Ahmed al-Jaber, the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) of the UAE is in Tokyo for talks with Seko, METI said.The visit was planned before the U.S. announcement, an official in the Japanese ministry said.Khaled al-Fadhel, the Kuwaiti oil minister, is also in Tokyo, the METI official said.Al-Jaber and al-Fadhel will hold talks with Seko separately later on Tuesday but there are no plans to discuss alternative supplies to Iranian crude at the meetings, the official said.
End to Iran sanction waivers only bullish for oil prices in short term: Barclays:::::FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the trading floor of Barclays Bank at Canary Wharf in London, Britain December 7, 2018.REUTERS/Simon Dawson (Reuters) - The U.S. push to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero will tighten crude markets significantly in the short term, but is unlikely to have a big effect on prices over a longer period, Barclays said in a note on Monday.Washington this week demanded that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, a move to choke off Tehrans oil revenues that sent crude prices to six-month highs on fears of a potential supply crunch.[O/R] The announcement implies material upside risk to our current $70 per barrel average price forecast for Brent this year, compared with the year-to-date average of $65 per barrel, the British bank said.But (it) does not affect our view on longer-term prices materially.While Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will likely fill the gap in supply created in the wake of tighter U.S. sanctions, the bank expects Riyadh to be slower to adjust than it was when crimping production late last year.Barclays also said that the U.S. move increased the risk of conflict in the Middle East, including the potential closure of the strategic Strait of Hormuz.The response of Irans biggest oil customers, China and India, will also be key as both could find it hard to completely wean themselves off supplies from the Middle Eastern nation, Barclays said.
Fast track: Indonesia, Malaysia rail projects may give China more deals:::::WALLINI, Indonesia (Reuters) - In a rural part of Indonesias Java island, two orange-clad workers confer in Mandarin over plans to lay tracks on a stretch of a $6 billion high-speed rail project between the capital Jakarta and the textile hub of Bandung.A worker stands in front of Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Railway exhibition hall at Walini tunnel construction site in West Bandung regency, West Java province, Indonesia, February 21, 2019.REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan Both are employees of the state-owned China Railway Engineering Corp (CREC), and have previously worked on a rail project in Uganda, another part of Beijings sweeping multi-billion dollar Belt and Road initiative (BRI) to connect China with Asia, Europe and beyond.Delayed for nearly three years over land ownership issues, construction on the 142 km (88-mile) Indonesian line finally kicked into high gear in 2018.When China hosts its second summit of nations that are part of BRI this week, Beijing is likely to showcase the Indonesian project along with its recent success in getting Malaysias East Coast Railway Link (ECRL) back on track after months of negotiations.Analysts say the two projects will be held up as Chinas answers to criticism about high debt and the lack of transparency in the BRI and its attempt to refocus the program on sustainable financing, green growth, and high quality.Chinas foreign ministry said last week Beijing would work together with all parties to benefit people across the world by jointly promoting the high-quality development of BRI in line with the national conditions of each country.The BRI is a key policy of Chinese President Xi Jinping but has been controversial in many Western capitals, particularly Washington, which views it as a means to spread Chinese influence abroad and saddle countries with unsustainable debt through nontransparent projects.According to a draft communique seen by Reuters, participants at this weeks summit will agree to project financing that respects global debt goals and promotes green growth.This bucks the trend of recent negative headlines around the BRI and challenges facing projects in several countries, said Peter Mumford at the Eurasia Group consultancy.But in Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed agreed to put the 668-km ECRL back on track only after cutting the cost of the project from $16 billion to $10.7 billion.The risk for China is that other countries, having seen Mahathirs success, now try to adopt similar tough re-negotiating tactics on BRI projects, which could slow progress elsewhere, said Mumford.To be sure, there is no sign of any of the BRI countries attempting to re-negotiate deals signed with Beijing.Analysts say China is likely to use its willingness to work with partner nations and make projects feasible to seek more business.GOLD-PLATED Bankers familiar with the deal say the Indonesian project is being constructed under gold-plated terms.Of the total $6 billion cost, Chinas Development Bank will provide a $4.5 billion loan at 2 percent interest, according a project prospectus seen by Reuters.The remaining 25 percent of the project cost will be funded by equity provided by the consortium.The loan will have no sovereign guarantees, which are among the most controversial parts of Belt and Road projects, as they shift risk onto the governments of partner countries.Beijing lobbied hard against Tokyo in 2015 to win the Indonesian project as a way to showcase its high-speed rail expertise to international customers.China wanted to deliberately show that its fast train was better than Japan ... we asked for the lowest rate possible and they gave 2 percent, Rini Soemarno, Indonesias minister for state-owned enterprises, told reporters earlier this year.The railways financial terms came under debate during Aprils presidential election between Indonesian President Joko Widodo and challenger Prabowo Subianto, who pledged to review the project if he pulled off a victory.While the results are still to be officially confirmed, sample vote counts by independent pollsters show Widodo to be headed for a second term.At the project site, there seem to be no doubts that it will be completed.Deep in Indonesias tea country, workers are directing drilling machines into a hillside, displacing red earth to carve out two tunnels that will lead to the station of Wallini, a tea plantation near Bandung.Chinese workers there told Reuters they had been at the site for a year and expected to stay until the projects completion in 2021.Four new satellite towns will be built by the train consortium along the route.Widodos government is currently offering up to $91 billion in infrastructure projects to Chinese companies, according to Luhut Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister for maritime affairs, who said Chinese officials have toured regional governments in search of projects to fund.Two top officials told Reuters Widodo intends to lead a delegation to the Belt and Road forum, where some of those projects are expected to be signed.One of the officials, Indonesias investment board chief, Thomas Lembong, told Reuters he expected this weeks summit to be a turning point, a Belt and Road 2.0 with China more willing to negotiate.The Chinese leadership will do whatever it takes to make Belt and Road a success, even if that means making it more professionalised, transparent, and more cooperative, he said.THE SINGAPORE LINK The revival of the Malaysian project is likely to give China hope of securing another train project: the high speed rail (HSR) between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore, which was postponed by Mahathir after he initially threatened to cancel it.China will likely take heart from the ECRL outcome and focus their efforts on ensuring that the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore HSR remains on track, Harrison Cheng, an analyst at Control Risks, told Reuters.Beijing had been intent on being awarded the project to prove that its rail expertise could win over rivals in a first-world country like Singapore, with its diplomats describing it as a must win at all costs project.Slideshow (5 Images) Apart from CREC, consortiums from Japan, South Korea, Europe, Singapore and Malaysia are also in the race, if the project is revived.A source in the Singaporean government said Malaysia would have to pay significant penalties to cancel the project altogether.Mahathir as well as Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong will take part in this weeks Belt and Road summit, which could see China make a renewed push for the project.
ExxonMobil agrees 20-year LNG deal with China's Zhejiang Energy:::::SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said it has signed a 20-year agreement to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Chinas Zhejiang Energy, as the U.S. oil and gas giant steps up marketing of the fuel in China, the worlds second-largest buyer.The logo of Exxon Mobil Corporation is shown on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, December 30, 2015.REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Under the sales and purchase agreement, Exxon Mobil will supply 1 million tonnes a year of the super-chilled fuel to the provincial government-backed Zhejiang Energy, Exxon said in a statement late on Monday.The agreement, which follows a framework deal announced last October, did not give details on price or timing, or say where the supplies will be sourced.Exxon Mobil said last year it would deliver the LNG starting in the early 2020s, while LNG supplies to China would come from its global portfolio.The U.S. firm has been expanding its portfolio of LNG, including from upcoming projects in Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, Qatar and Golden Pass in the United States.Zhejiang Energy is building a 9 billion yuan ($1.34 billion) receiving terminal for the fuel in Wenzhou, in the eastern province of Zhejiang, with annual handling capacity of 3 million tonnes.Chinese state oil and gas major Sinopec will be a partner in the terminal.Chen Zhu, managing director at Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy, said the Exxon-Zhejiang deal was separate from U.S.- China trade negotiations under which Chinese firms are expected to eventually boost purchases of U.S. gas.The gas supplies to the Zhejiang firm will come from Exxons portfolio production outside the U.S., Chen said, adding that the Wenzhou terminal is likely to be operational in 2022 or 2023.Exxon already has two long-term LNG supply agreements in China, one each with Sinopec and CNPC, Chinas largest state oil group, she said.
Elon Musk on Tesla's self-driving capabilities:::::(Reuters) - Tesla Inc revealed its self-driving plans during an investor day on Monday, with Chief Executive Elon Musk predicting the launch of an autonomous robotaxi service next year in some U.S. markets.Musk has touted the electric car makers self-driving capabilities over the years, highlighting its semi-autonomous Autopilot system.Tesla began offering a feature described as Full Self-Driving Capability in 2016.The company instructs drivers to keep their hands on the wheel when those systems are engaged, sparking some criticism of the term.Following are the comments made by Musk and Tesla related to the topic in the past few years, including during Mondays event: 2019 April 22 - Musk predicts that Tesla will have autonomous robotaxis without drivers in some U.S. markets in 2020.April 22 - Musk predicts that probably two years from now well make a car with no steering wheels or pedals.April 22 - Musk says that in 2020, Tesla will have over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything.April 22 - Musk says it is financially insane to buy something other than a Tesla today because Tesla is the only company to have a full self-driving suite of hardware.April 15 Musk says that buying a car that cannot upgrade to full self-driving is like buying a horse instead of a car in 2019.April 11 - Tesla says that Autopilot, the companys advanced driver assistance system, is now standard on all vehicles.April 3 - Tesla says it is making significant progress in development of its autonomous driving software and hardware, including the FSD (Full Self-Driving) computer, saying the computer is in production and will enable full-self driving through over-the-air software updates in future.Feb. 28 In response to a media question whether it is problematic that Musk uses the term full self-driving, Musk replies: I think were very clear when you buy the car what is meant by full self-driving.It means its feature complete.Feature complete requiring supervision ... Theres really three steps: feature complete of full self-driving but requiring supervision, feature complete but not requiring supervision, feature complete not requiring supervision and regulators agree.2018 Oct. 5 - Tesla introduces software version 9.0 with a number of features including 'Navigate on Autopilot' intended to guide a car from a highway's on-ramp to off-ramp, including suggesting lane changes, navigating highway interchanges and taking exits that would still require driver supervision [bit.ly/2IFfMMN] June 11 - Musk tweets that Teslas Autopilot driver assistance system will get full self-driving features following a software upgrade in August May 23 - Two U.S. consumer advocacy groups urge the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Teslas deceptive and misleading use of the name Autopilot for its assisted-driving technology Feb. 2018 - Musk says Tesla can do a coast-to-coast autonomous drive in three months, six months at most Oct. 19 - Musk says he expects that by the end of 2017 a Tesla would be able to drive in full autonomous mode from Los Angeles to New York "without the need for a single touch" on the wheel.(reut.rs/2Pk7RYI)] Oct. 2016 - Tesla begins to sell a Full Self-Driving Capability option in its vehicles for $3,000, on top of the $5,000 price for Enhanced Autopilot.Musk says full self-driving features will be rolled out in future via over-the-air updates when available.The option was removed in October 2018, then reinstated in February 2019.FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory groundbreaking ceremony in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019.REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo Oct 2016 Musk says all new Teslas built have the hardware required for full self-driving.2015 Oct. 15 Tesla launches an advanced driver assistance system called Autopilot, with Musk cautioning that drivers should keep their hand on the wheel.(reut.rs/2VS8gnB)
T-Mobile, Sprint lobby regulators to win U.S. approval for tie-up:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior executives at T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp made the case to U.S. officials in Washington last week that they should approve a planned tie-up between the two wireless companies, arguing a combined firm would have incentives to aggressively lower prices.FILE PHOTO: A smartphones with Sprint logo are seen in front of a screen projection of T-mobile logo, in this picture illustration taken April 30, 2018.REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration T-Mobile US Chief Executive John Legere, Sprint executive chairman Marcelo Claure, T-Mobile US chief operating officer Michael Sievert, and other senior executives met with Federal Communications Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel on Thursday, according to a federal filing on Monday.In a presentation made public on Monday, the firms said they would focus on taking share from Verizon and AT&T through lower prices.If completed, the $26 billion merger would create a carrier with 127 million customers that would be a formidable competitor to the No.1 and No.2 wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T, respectively.A group of eight Democratic senators and independent Senator Bernie Sanders in February urged the Justice Department and FCC to reject the deal, saying monthly bills for consumers could rise as much as 10 percent.Consumer advocates warn the deal will reduce the number of national wireless carriers to three from four.Sources told Reuters last week that the Justice Department had concerns about the merger in its current structure.A person briefed on the matter confirmed Legere met on Thursday with the head of the Justice Departments antitrust division, Makan Delrahim, as the governments review nears a conclusion.A decision is likely by early June, people briefed on the matter said.The Justice Department declined comment.T-Mobile has said the combined company would be better and faster at building 5G, the next generation of wireless, to compete with AT&T and Verizon.In its presentation to Rosenworcel, T-Mobile cited Verizons decision to charge $10 extra per month for 5G service.This wont happen when new T-Mobile introduces 5G, the presentation said.The agreement to combine the carriers, struck in April 2018, was approved by both companies shareholders in October and has received national security clearance, but still needs approval from the Justice Department and FCC.A number of state attorneys general are also reviewing the deal.To win support for the deal, T-Mobile had said it would not increase prices for three years and has pledged to use some spectrum for wireless broadband in rural areas.The firms say the combined entity would add 11,000 additional employees by 2024 compared to the standalone firms.
Facebook hires State Department lawyer as general counsel:::::FILE PHOTO: Jennifer Newstead, Legal Advisor, U.S. Department of State, attends a hearing for alleged violations of the 1955 Treaty of Amity between Iran and the U.S., at the International Court in The Hague, Netherlands August 27, 2018.REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw (Reuters) - Facebook Inc on Monday named the legal adviser to the U.S. State Department as its general counsel, as the social media giant faces growing regulatory hurdles and privacy concerns.Jennifer Newstead, who brings government and private sector experience to the role, will succeed Colin Stretch, who decided to quit the company in July 2018, Facebook said in a blog post.Facebook has come under increasing pressure around the world to stop the spread of misinformation on its platform, while its ad practises have been in the spotlight for two years amid growing discontent over its approach to privacy and user data.The social media company also named John Pinette as vice president of global communications, succeeding Caryn Marooney, who decided to leave the company in February.
Tesla says robotaxis coming to U.S. roads next year, slams rivals' use of Lidar:::::SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chief Executive Elon Musk said Tesla Inc robotaxis with no human drivers would be available in some U.S. markets next year, continuing a habit of bold pronouncements that have excited many investors while often missing deadlines.Probably two years from now well make a car with no steering wheels or pedals, Musk predicted, while acknowledging he is often late to meet aggressive targets.Central to this promise is a new microchip for self-driving vehicles unveiled by Musk on Monday during a webcast presentation.Made by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in Texas, the chip now in all vehicles is hoped to give Tesla an edge over rivals and show its massive investment in autonomous driving - described by Musk as basically our entire expense structure - will pay off.The webcast presentation came two days before Tesla is expected to announce a quarterly loss on fewer deliveries of its Model 3 sedan, which represents Teslas attempt to become a volume car maker.After launching the event with detailed technical descriptions of Teslas progress on hardware and software by top executives, Musk began hawking the Model 3 and its potential.The fundamental message consumers should be taking away today is its financially insane to buy something other than a Tesla.Its like buying a horse, saying Tesla was the only company to have a full self-driving suite of hardware.Teslas use of the term full self-driving garners criticism, as it sells such an option today that is not yet Level 4, or fully autonomous by industry standards, in which the car can handle all aspects of driving in most circumstances with no human intervention.Musk has said that with the hardware complete, improvements in software will allow vehicles to fully drive themselves in future.The technology faces many regulatory hurdles both in Washington and from local governments.Global carmakers, large technology companies and startups are developing self-driving - including Alphabet Incs Waymo and Uber Technologies Inc - but experts say it will be years before the systems are ready for prime time.A year from now well have over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything, Musk predicted.FILE PHOTO: A Tesla logo is seen in Los Angeles, California U.S. January 12, 2018.REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Tesla has been working on a self-driving chip since 2016 and Musk had previously forecast that cars would be fully self-driving by 2018, a target Tesla has missed.Investors appeared unmoved by the chip announcement but shares rose slightly in after-hour trading following the announcement of the robotaxis.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives said Teslas robotaxi ambition was impressive, but added that investors will be concerned by the practicality and financial implications of this endeavor especially with Waymo miles ahead of the autonomous competition.More pressing for analysts, he said, were concerns about demand for the Model 3 and whether Tesla may seek new financing.DOOMED RIVALS Musk took a swipe at competitors relying on Lidar, light-based sensors that are a key element in most other self-driving systems.Lidar is a fools errand.And anyone relying on Lidar is doomed, said Musk, who has been vocal about the technologys limitations.Tesla vehicles rely on cameras and radars as their vision system for self-driving.Competitors will eventually dump Lidar, he said: Its expensive and unnecessary and once you solved vision its worthless.More than $1 billion in corporate and private investment has been plowed into some 50 Lidar startups over the past three years, including a record $420 million in 2018, according to a Reuters analysis of publicly available investment data in March.Musk called Teslas new chip the industrys best because it was dedicated for autonomous driving, while others, like Nvidia Corp, developed chips for multiple uses.FILE PHOTO: Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory groundbreaking ceremony in Shanghai, China January 7, 2019.REUTERS/Aly Song Teslas chip was capable of seven times as many frames as Nvidias Xavier system, said Pete Bannon, Teslas head of Autopilot hardware.Nvidia said the comparison was inaccurate.U.S. magazine Consumer Reports cautioned against Teslas bold claims about self-driving capabilities that overpromise and underdeliver.Claims about (Teslas) driving automation systems and safety are not backed up by the data, and it seems todays presentations had more to do with investors than consumers safety, wrote the publication.
Kraft Heinz's new CEO looks beyond cost-cutting, big M&A:::::CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Cos incoming chief executive, Miguel Patricio, is indicating a change in strategy for the packaged food company that could move it away from the aggressive cost-focused culture that has been in place since the company was created in 2015.FILE PHOTO: Commemorative items for sale are on display at the Kraft Heinz booth during the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha, Nebraska, U.S. April 30, 2016.REUTERS/Ryan Henriksen Patricio, a 52-year-old Portuguese native who will take over the helm of the worlds fifth biggest food company from July 1, said he plans to focus more on efficiency, investing in brands and growing sales organically at a company that has been reeling from a $15.4 billion writedown on some of its brands.Kraft Heinzs focus on cost-cutting and interest in scoring a big acquisition have been key to the companys strategy under management installed by Brazilian private equity firm 3G Capital.3G, along with Warren Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway, forged the $49 billion merger of Kraft Foods with H.J.Heinz in 2015.I think the obsession for efficiency has to be much bigger than the obsession for cutting costs, Patricio, 52, told Reuters on Monday.Cost cutting should be a priority for any company.However, you cannot cut costs every year, said Patricio, who most recently was the global head of marketing for brewer Anheuser-Busch InBevs.He previously worked at Philip Morris, Coca-Cola Co and Johnson & Johnson.3G Capital, which is Kraft Heinzs second largest shareholder, behind Berkshire Hathaway, with a 22.15 percent stake, is known for scoring large M&A deals and using a controversial cost-cutting tool called zero-based budgeting to keep profit margins high.Zero-based budgeting requires managers to justify their expenses annually from scratch, rather than use the prior year as a guide or pursue cost savings on an ongoing basis.Kraft Heinzs outgoing CEO, Bernardo Hees, a 3G partner, told Reuters in September that he was considering M&A to fuel growth.Asked on Monday if Kraft Heinz was still considering big acquisitions, Patricio said he was sure the company would do so one day, but that his focus, for now, was on growing existing brands.At this moment, Im really focused on the organic part of it.I think we can - and we need to get organic growth and Im going to put a lot of my time figuring that out.INVESTORS WANT PROOF The announcement comes two months after Kraft Heinz took the massive writedown on some of its brands, cut its dividend and disclosed a Securities and Exchange Commission probe into accounting practices at its procurement unit.Intense competition from private-label brands, changing consumer habits and pressure from retailers to lower prices has sent the food industry reeling in recent years.Given whats happened at Kraft Heinz in the past several months, that 3G model has come into question, Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said.I think they realize they cut a little too far.And to Patricios point, it may now be about investing where you need to while maintaining cost discipline.Investors want to see proof that can grow sales.Weissman said.Its good to hear theyre not thinking about an imminent acquisition.From a balance sheet perspective, theyre not there yet.3G did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Under Hees, Kraft Heinz lost half its market value, as it ceded market share to competitors and failed to snap up Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever Plc in a proposed $143-billion merger.At the time, Unilever cited concerns about Kraft Heinzs culture.Kraft Heinzs cost-focused strategy also gave way to a high-pressure, anxious environment, according to four former Kraft Heinz employees who worked at the companys Chicago headquarters and two former employees from Europe.The deep cuts and layoffs also ate away at advertising budgets and decades of industry experience, said two sources who worked at Kraft Heinzs marketing department.3G are known for being ruthless and brutal when it comes to cost and what does that do to culture?Edward Jones Weissman said.Its too early to see how much flexibility Patricio will have to change the culture or improve processes at the company.Can he get those brands back to growth?Thats probably going to take a lot of investment.Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a pillar of the Kraft Heinz culture, spokesman Michael Mullen said, noting that cost savings help the company increase support for its brands, drive innovation, and invest in top-tier talent.In 2018, and again this year, savings from ZBB allow us to invest in new capabilities, emerging channels, and new product platforms for top-line growth, Mullen said.Industry analysts have raised concerns that Kraft Heinz was pricing its brands too high at a time when private-label brands from Walmart, Aldi and Kroger were gaining popularity.Kraft Heinzs ketchups, sliced cheeses and hot dogs were some of the first products these retailers sought to replicate at a lower price.Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc owns 26.7 percent of Kraft Heinz, highlighted the pressure from retailers in February, saying Costco Wholesale Corps Kirkland brand outsells all Kraft Heinz products.These next two months, Im going to dedicate fully to knowing the people (at Kraft Heinz), to build on culture, to agree or tweak the long-term strategy of the company, and to know the financials behind the business in detail.These are the four big things I want to do, Patricio told Reuters.I bring diversity of thought to the team.My background is very different from the background of the other team members.And I think that this is critical in any company.
Barclays to cut investment bankers' bonuses: FT:::::FILE PHOTO: Traders work on the trading floor of Barclays Bank at Canary Wharf in London, Britain December 7, 2018.REUTERS/Simon Dawson (Reuters) - Barclays Plc is planning to cut bonuses for investment bankers as it steps up its defense against activist investor Edward Bramson ahead of next weeks annual meeting, the Financial Times reported on Monday.The British bank is cutting bonuses as part of a cost-cutting measure to enhance returns at the banks underperforming investment division, the FT said, citing several people briefed on the plans.Monday was a public holiday in Britain, and Barclays declined to comment on the matter.Last month, the chief executive of Barclays, Jes Staley, took direct control of its investment bank and ousted head Tim Throsby in a surprise shake-up.Barclays has been urging shareholders to oppose Bramsons bid to be appointed to the banks board at its annual general meeting on May 2.Last week, Bramson made a renewed plea to investors about a seat on the banks board.
Samsung delays Galaxy Fold phone launch over screen problems:::::(Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Monday it would delay the retail launch of its Galaxy Fold smartphone for an unspecified period of time after reviewers discovered problems with the display, a hit to the reputation of the worlds largest handset maker.Last week, reviewers started posting problems with the device on Twitter, but as of Friday the company did not know the root cause of the screen defects, according to Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, who said he was in direct contact with the company.About 50 units of the $1,980 foldable device had been sent for review to journalists, analysts and bloggers in the United States ahead of a planned April 26 launch, Moorhead said.It was not immediately clear how many of the devices were defective.Four units sent to journalists and a YouTube personality contained problems, according to their posts on Twitter.Samsung declined comment beyond a prepared statement.To fully evaluate this feedback and run further internal tests, we have decided to delay the release of the Galaxy Fold.We plan to announce the release date in the coming weeks, a Samsung spokesperson said on Monday.Samsung also postponed media events for the device planned for this week in Hong Kong and Shanghai.While Samsung has not said how long the delay could be or whether production of the unit has halted completely, some analysts said the delay was minor compared to the massive recall and production halt that the company endured with its Galaxy Note 7 in 2016.Its certainly an embarrassment to Samsungs reputation but this wont have much financial impact on them since they created a whole new category of foldables with this product.There is no market share to lose, said Moorhead, who added that his test version of the phone was working without any issues.Instead of plaudits ahead of the phones planned launch, the South Korean conglomerate has been blighted by a handful of technology journalists reporting breaks, bulges and blinking screens.Samsung said initial findings showed that the issues could be associated with impact on exposed areas of the hinges.It also said there were instances where substances found inside the device affected the display performance.Wayne Lam, an analyst with IHS Markit, predicted the issue would likely be resolved within a month.We all know that Samsung has a technology that works.Its likely that this glitch is a problem with mass production and the failure is just in the single digit percentage, he said.FILE PHOTO: The Samsung Galaxy Fold phone is shown on a screen at Samsung Electronics Co Ltds Unpacked event in San Francisco, California, U.S., Feb. 20, 2019.REUTERS/Stephen Nellis/File Photo Samsung has hailed the folding design as the future in a field that has seen few surprises since Apple Incs iPhone in 2007.Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has also announced a folding handset, the Mate X. Samsung was initially planning to begin South Korean and European sales of the unit in May and Chinese sales from an undisclosed date.AT&T, one of Samsungs U.S. launch partners for the Galaxy Fold, said the carrier was working to communicate with customers who pre-ordered the device as soon as possible.AT&T did not disclose the number of pre-orders.
Mexico ready to retaliate by hurting American corn farmers:::::Mexico is ready to hit the U.S. where it hurts: Corn.Mexico is one of the top buyers of American corn in the world today.And Mexican senator Armando Rios Piter, who leads a congressional committee on foreign relations, says he will introduce a bill this week where Mexico will buy corn from Brazil and Argentina instead of the United States.It's one of the first signs of potential concrete action from Mexico in response to President Trump's threats against the country."I'm going to send a bill for the corn that we are buying in the Midwest and...change to Brazil or Argentina," Rios Piter, 43, told told CNN's Leyla Santiago on Sunday at an anti-Trump protest in Mexico City.He added: It's a "good way to tell them that this hostile relationship has consequences, hope that it changes."American corn goes into a lot of the country's food.In Mexico City, from fine dining restaurants to taco stands on the street, corn-based favorites like tacos can be found everywhere.Related: Mexican farmer's daughter: NAFTA destroyed us America is also the world's largest producer and exporter of corn.American corn shipments to Mexico have catapulted since NAFTA, a free trade deal signed between Mexico, America and Canada.American farmers sent $2.4 billion of corn to Mexico in 2015, the most recent year of available data.In 1995, the year after NAFTA became law, corn exports to Mexico were a mere $391 million.Experts say such a bill would be very costly to U.S. farmers."If we do indeed see a trade war where Mexico starts buying from Brazil...we're going to see it affect the corn market and ripple out to the rest of the ag economy," says Darin Newsom, senior analyst at DTN, an agricultural management firm.Rios Piter's bill is another sign of Mexico's willingness to respond to Trump's threats.Trump wants to make Mexico pay for a wall on the border, and he's threatened taxes on Mexican imports ranging from 20% to 35%.Trump also wants to renegotiate NAFTA.He blames it for a flood of manufacturing jobs to Mexico.A nonpartisan congressional research report found that not to be true.Related: Mexico doubles down on Trump 'contingency plan' Still, Trump says he wants a better trade deal for the American worker -- though he hasn't said what a better deal looks like.All sides signaled two weeks ago that negotiations would begin in May after a 90-day consultation period.But Trump says if negotiations don't bear the deal he wants, he threatens to withdraw from NAFTA.Such tough talk isn't received well by Mexican leaders like Rios Piter.He's not alone.Mexico's economy minister, Ildefonso Guajardo, said in January Mexico would respond "immediately" to any tariffs from Trump."It's very clear that we have to be prepared to immediately be able to neutralize the impact of a measure of that nature," Guajardo said Jan. 13 on a Mexican news show.--Shasta Darlington contributed reporting to this story
Will the next iPhone charge wirelessly?:::::You may never have to plug in your iPhone again.Apple has joined an industry group devoted to wireless charging, strengthening existing rumors that the next iPhone will charge without a cord.The Wireless Power Consortium, which is made up of some 200 organizations that promote a single wireless charging standard, confirmed to CNNTech that Apple joined the group last week.IPhone rumors swirl months before each new version is announced, and hype around the so-called 'iPhone 8" is particularly high: Apple (AAPL) is expected to unveil a major redesign of the this fall to mark the 10-year anniversary of the smartphone.The company has already shown interest in doing away with cumbersome cords.The Apple Watch charges wirelessly, provided consumers spend $79 on a magnetic charging dock.And the latest MacBook now comes with only one USB port.Related: Apple stock nears a record high Apple would also create another iPhone revenue stream by selling a wireless charging station separately.The feature would simplify charging for smartphone owners.Rather than plugging in one's phone, a user would only need to place it on the charging dock.Apple said in a statement Monday it was joining the Wireless Power Consortium to contribute its ideas as wireless charging standards are developed.As for the speculated possible features of the next iPhone, other rumors include an edge-to-edge display, a glass body and the removal of the home button.
How 'America First' could turn into 'India First':::::America is great because of its willingness to accept talented immigrants.That's what Nandan Nilekani, the billionaire co-founder of Infosys Technologies, would tell President Trump if he had the opportunity."If you really want to keep the U.S. ... globally competitive, you should be open to overseas talent," Nilekani said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.Infosys (INFY) is India's second-largest outsourcing firm, and a major recipient of U.S. H-1B visas.The documents allow the tech firm to employ a huge number of Indians in U.S. jobs.The Trump administration is now considering significant changes to the visa program.Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in January that Trump will continue to talk about reforming the H-1B program, among others, as part of a larger push for immigration reform.Curbs on the visas could hit Indian workers hardest.India is the top source of high-skilled labor for the U.S. tech industry.According to U.S. government data, 70% of the hugely popular H-1B visas go to Indians.Shares in several Indian tech companies -- including Infosys -- plunged spectacularly two weeks ago amid reports of an impending work visa crackdown.Related: Tech industry braces for Trump's visa reform Nilekani said it would be a mistake for the administration to follow through."Indian companies have done a great deal to help U.S. companies become more competitive, and I think that should continue," Nilekani said."If you look at the Silicon Valley ... most of the companies have an immigrant founder."India's contribution to the industry -- especially at top levels -- has been outsized.The current CEOs of Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), for example, were both born in India.Related: India freaks out over U.S. plans to change high-skilled visas But Nilekani, who is also the architect of India's ambitious biometric ID program, suggested that India would ultimately benefit from any new restrictions put in place under Trump's "America First" plan.If talented engineers can't go to the U.S., they will stay in India."This issue of visas has always come up in the U.S. every few years, especially during election season," he said."It's actually accelerated the development work [in India], because ... people are investing more to do the work here."Nilekani cited his own projects for the Indian government as an example.The Bangalore-born entrepreneur left Infosys in 2009 to run India's massive social security program, which is known as Aadhaar.As a result of the initiative, the vast majority of India's 1.3 billion citizens now have a biometric ID number that allows them to receive government services, execute bank transactions and even make biometric payments."It was built by extremely talented and committed Indians," Nilekani said."Many of them had global experience, but they brought that talent and experience to solve India's problems."Nilekani said the country's massive youth population is increasingly choosing to stay home and pitch in."It's India first," he said.
Swiss voters reject corporate tax overhaul:::::Voters in Switzerland have shocked the political establishment by rejecting a reform plan that would have brought the country's corporate tax system in line with international norms.The tax reforms, which were widely supported by the business community, would have removed a set of special low-tax privileges that had encouraged many multinational companies to set up shop in Switzerland.Experts say the future of Switzerland's tax system is now unclear.The vote result could create headaches for firms that had been banking on their implementation, and deter companies who had been considering a move to the country."They do not know what [tax] measures will be available... That is not a very solid basis for making investment decisions," Peter Uebelhart, head of tax at KPMG in Switzerland, said in a video statement.Switzerland has come under intense pressure from G20 and OECD nations in recent years to clean up its tax system.The country runs the risk of being "blacklisted" by other nations if it doesn't change its tax system by 2019.Many voters rejected the tax reform package over fears it might reduce the amount of revenue collected by the government, according to Stefan Kuhn, head of corporate tax at KPMG in Switzerland.That might have lead to tax hikes on the middle class.The current tax system gives preferential treatment to some companies with large foreign operations.International tax authorities say the rules amount to unfair corporate subsidies.Martin Naville, head of the Swiss-American Chamber of Commerce, said it's possible that voters didn't understand the complexities of the reforms.The measures were rejected by 59% of voters."I think it's a very bad day for Switzerland," Naville said."Clearly, the uncertainty and the credibility in the Swiss [system] has taken a massive hit."Related: How Europe's elections could be hacked Swiss authorities say they will move quickly to create a modified tax reform proposal.Naville said he hopes new rules are devised within the next few months."All stakeholders now have to take responsibility to develop an acceptable competitive tax system, and to regain credibility regarding the famed political stability which gave Switzerland such an advantageous position," he said in a statement.Naville hinted that potential tax reforms in the U.S. and U.K. could tempt Swiss-based companies to relocate, putting more pressure on Switzerland's tax base.

But is Trump the reason?:::::The Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 each hit new all-time highs Monday.Investors are giddy with excitement and they clearly believe that both big blue chip multinationals and smaller companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will continue to thrive.So is this the Donald Trump rally?Or the Janet Yellen rally?Some strategists believe Trump's stimulus plans and talk of killing many burdensome regulations are the reasons stocks are soaring.Or perhaps this is better characterized as a continuation of the Barack Obama rally instead?You could argue that POTUS 44 has dealt POTUS 45 a pretty good hand.The solid job market and overall economy that Trump inherited may be the reason consumers and businesses are so confident.But investors (and financial journalists) are often quick to give the president more credit -- and blame -- than they probably deserve for the performance of the stock market.RBC strategist Jonathan Golub pointed this out in a report on Monday, one that was aptly titled "Message to Market: It's Not All About Donald."Related: Trump isn't killing the bull market Golub noted that the S&P 500 rose nearly 7% from late June through Election Day -- a time when most polls were predicting that Hillary Clinton would be the next president.But stocks have continued to rally since then, rising another 8% since Trump pulled off the upset (at least to the mainstream media and Wall Street) victory.You can't have it both ways.It makes no logical sense to suggest that stocks rallied because investors believed Trump would lose and that they continued to rally because Trump didn't lose.Bond yields have also been rising since Trump won, a phenomenon that many investors have attributed to the likelihood of stimulus from the president and Republican Congress.Yet Golub points out that the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury was going up during the late summer as well.Of course, many investors were expecting stimulus from Clinton too.Yet once again, many investors are claiming that Trump is the catalyst for something that not only was going on before he was elected, but was happening because many thought he would lose.Related: Stocks have avoided a 1% dive for an unusually long period of time So it's odd that Trump is being cited as the main reason for a market rally that began months before anyone felt he could win.What's really going on?The one constant during the past few months is the Federal Reserve.Yes.the markets are reacting to Washington.But they are paying closer attention to Janet Yellen, not the White House.The Fed made it crystal clear before the election that it would probably raise interest rates in December and do so a few more times in 2017 regardless of who won the race for president.The good news for investors is that the U.S. economy seems to be growing steadily, but does not appear to be at risk of overheating.Related: Here's why the world's largest money manager is worried The most recent jobs report showed that wages grew at a decent rate of 2.5% annually.But that's not nearly high enough to spark fears of runaway inflation and lead the Fed to aggressively raise rates.Even if Yellen and the Fed hike rates three times this year, they are likely to do so by just a quarter point every time.That would push the Fed's key short-term rate to a range of 1.25% to 1.5%.That's still extremely low.At those levels, stocks would still be more attractive than bonds.Corporate earnings should be able to keep rising at a healthy clip.And consumers would probably keep spending.So investors would be wise to keep a close eye on Yellen and not just have a myopic focus on the president, With that in mind, Yellen is set to testify in front of Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday.And what she says about the timing and magnitude of future rate hikes could wind up keeping the rally going full steam ahead -- or stopping it dead in its tracks.
Apple stock nears record high:::::Apple has found its groove again.The iPhone maker's stock hit $133.82 in early trading Monday, putting Apple less than $1 away from its intraday trading high of $134.54, reached in April 2015.Apple's stock ended the day at $133.29, beating its previous record closing price of $133, set in February 2015.The stock surge, pushing Apple (AAPL) to a $700 billion market cap, comes amid renewed optimism for the iPhone.Goldman Sachs raised its price target for the stock on Monday, citing the likelihood of "major new features" like "3D sensing" being added to the next iPhone model, according to an investor note provided to CNNMoney.Apple's previous high was set six months after it released the redesigned iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, kicking off what CEO Tim Cook described as the "mother of all upgrades."Since then, however, Apple has bucked its tradition of overhauling the iPhone every other year.The newest models on the market today look nearly identical to the iPhones available in late 2014.The long wait, combined with this year marking the iPhone's tenth anniversary, has only raised expectations that Apple is about to significantly overhaul its smartphone and reignite demand.Related: Tim Cook: 'Apple would not exist without immigration' Apple's annual sales fell in the 2016 fiscal year for the first time since 2001 as iPhone sales, still the majority of its business, declined in three consecutive quarters.Apple even cut its CEO's pay by 15% due to the company's failure to meet its performance goals for both sales and profits.But that losing streak just ended.Apple sales started growing again in the December quarter, driven by stronger demand for the iPhone -- particularly for the larger and more expensive iPhone 7 Plus.The company sold 78.3 million iPhones for the quarter, setting a new record.At least some of that may be due to the Samsung's smartphone recall woes.Mark Moskowitz, an analyst with William Blair, wrote in an investor note this month, "Samsung's Note 7 struggles likely helped."The iPhone isn't the only reason Wall Street is excited about Apple.There's also President Trump.Despite Trump clashing with Apple during the campaign, investors are now optimistic Apple will benefit from at least one Trump proposal: cutting taxes on cash that U.S. businesses bring back from their overseas accounts.Apple currently has $230 billion in cash held in foreign accounts.If Trump and Congress make it cheaper for Apple to bring that money back, it could be used for acquisitions and buybacks.
America's NAFTA nemesis: Canada, not Mexico:::::America and Canada have one of the world's biggest trade relationships.President Donald Trump met for the first time Monday with Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau."We have a very outstanding trade relationship with Canada," Trump said at the news conference.But the U.S.-Canada trade relationship over the years has not been as smooth as you might think.There have been trade wars, acts of retaliation, allegations of dumping and jobs lost."Our trading relationship obviously is strong...but the relationship has been rocky, despite the agreements we have in place," says Stuart Trew, an editor at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, a research group in Ottawa, Canada's capital.Trump has often slammed Mexico and NAFTA, the trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.But Canada is rarely mentioned.Yet, there have been more NAFTA dispute claims against Canada -- almost all by U.S. companies -- than against Mexico.Even today, Canada has stiff tariffs against the United States and the two sides only recently resolved a bitter dispute over meat.Most leaders and experts stress that trade ties between the two nations are strong and mostly positive.But Canada and America have had plenty of battles along the way.Now Trump wants to renegotiate NAFTA, which will be on the top of the agenda for his meeting with Trudeau.1.Canada gets in more NAFTA trouble than Mexico Listening to Trump, you might think Mexico is the bad actor of NAFTA.But since NAFTA's inception in 1994, there have been 39 complaints brought against Canada, almost all by U.S. companies.Known in the industry as the investor state dispute settlements, it allows companies to resolve cases under a special panel of NAFTA judges instead of local courts in Mexico, Canada, or the U.S.There's only been 23 complaints against Mexico.(By comparison, companies from both Mexico and Canada have filed a total of 21 complaints against the U.S.) And increasingly, Canada is the target of American complaints.Since 2005, Canada has been hit with 70% of the NAFTA dispute claims, according to CCPA, a Canadian research firm.2.The U.S. - Canada lumber battle NAFTA isn't the only sore area.In 2002, the U.S. slapped a roughly 30% tariff on Canadian lumber, alleging that Canada was "dumping" its wood on the U.S. market.Canada rejected the claim and argued the tariff cost its lumber companies 30,000 jobs."It was a very sour point in Canadian - American relations for quite a while," says Tom Velk, an economics professor at McGill University in Montreal.The dispute had its origins in the 1980s, when American lumber companies said their Canadian counterparts weren't playing fair.Whether Canada actually broke the rules is a matter of dispute.Canadian officials deny that the government is subsidizing softwood lumber companies in Canada.American lumber companies still allege that it does, and a U.S. Commerce Department report found that Canada was providing subsidies to lumber companies in 2004.It didn't say whether the subsidies were ongoing.According to the allegations, Canada subsidized lumber companies because the government owns many of the lands where the wood comes from.That subsidy -- on top of Canada's huge lumber supply -- allowed Canada to price its lumber below what U.S. companies can charge.The World Trade Organization ultimately sided with Canada, denying America's claim and the two sides came to an agreement in 2006 to end the tariff.However, that agreement and its ensuing grace period expired in October, and the two sides are back at it again.The Obama and Trudeau administrations couldn't reach a compromise before Obama left office and it remains a contentious trade issue with U.S. lumber companies calling once again for tariffs.Related: 'Without NAFTA' we'd be out of business 3.Smoot-Hawley triggers U.S. - Canada trade war Things got even worse during the Great Depression.In 1930, Congress wanted to protect U.S. jobs from global trade.So the U.S. slapped tariffs on all countries that shipped goods to America in an effort to shield workers.It was called the Smoot-Hawley Act.Today, it is widely accepted that this law made the Great Depression worse than it was.Canada was furious, and retaliated more than any other country against the U.S., sparking a trade war."Canada was so incensed that...they raised their own tariff on certain products to match the new U.S. tariff," according to Doug Irwin, a Dartmouth Professor and author of "Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression."For example, the U.S. increased a tariff on eggs from 8 cents to 10 cents (these are 1930s prices, after all).Canada retaliated by also increasing its tariff from 3 cents to 10 cents -- a threefold increase.Exports dwindled sharply: in 1929, the U.S. exported nearly 920,000 eggs to Canada.Three years later, it only shipped about 14,000 eggs, according to Irwin.Related: Remember Smoot-Hawley: America's last major trade war 4.Canada's sky high tariffs on U.S. eggs, poultry, milk Fast forward to today.Smoot-Hawley is long gone, but Canada continues to charge steep tariffs on U.S. imports of eggs, chicken and milk.For instance, some tariffs on eggs are as high as 238% per dozen, according to Canada's Agriculture Department.Some milk imports, depending on the fat content, are as high as 292%."They're so onerous that you can't bring it across.There's no American eggs in Quebec," says Velk.According to Canada's Embassy in the U.S., reality is much different.Its officials say that despite some stiff tariffs, Canada is one of the top export markets for American milk, poultry and eggs.The U.S. does have tariffs on some goods coming from all countries, but they are not nearly as high as Canada's.Experts say these tariffs continue to irk some U.S. dairy and poultry farmers, some of whom are challenged to sell into the Canadian market.But they doubt much will change since the tariffs have been in place for decades now.Related: Those Reagan tariffs Trump loves to talk about 5.COOLer heads and the future of NAFTA Despite all these disputes, experts stress this trade relationship is still one of the best in the world.In fact, the two countries are so interconnected now, when trade disputes erupt sometimes American companies will side with Canadian companies and against U.S. lawmakers.For example, Canadian meat producers disputed a U.S. law that required them to label where the cattle was born, raised and slaughtered.Canadians said the law discriminated against its meat from being sold in the U.S. and took the case to the WTO.The WTO sided with Canada, and last December, Congress repealed the country-of-origin-labeling law.American meat producers -- whose business is intertwined with Canada -- actually supported their counterparts in Canada, arguing the regulation was too burdensome.As for Trump's proposal of tearing up NAFTA, many American and Canadian experts say that it's not worth it to renegotiate or end the agreement.The three countries that are part of the agreement are so enmeshed with each other that untangling all that integration would be detrimental to trade and economic growth.--Editor's note: This story was originally published on August 11, 2016.We have since updated it.
Verizon's new plan: Consumers win, investors lose:::::Verizon has brought back its unlimited data plan.That's great if you're a Verizon customer.But it is terrible news for its investors.Verizon (VZ) stock fell nearly 1.5% in early trading Monday.It's now down about 10% so far this year, making it the Dow's worst performer of 2017.Verizon's move is a clear sign the company has to pull out all the stops to remain competitive with wireless rivals AT&T (T), Sprint (S) and T-Mobile (TMUS)."In recent months, both T-Mobile and Sprint had some success taking additional share from Verizon by virtue of their unlimited offerings," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report Monday morning.That may explain why shares of T-Mobile and Sprint, which is now controlled by Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, are both up this year while Verizon is down.T-Mobile and Sprint have also been perennially linked as possible merger partners.But the new telecom price war isn't the only problem for Verizon.AT&T recently acquired satellite broadcast provider DirecTV, a move that makes Ma Bell more competitive against Verizon in the battle to control people's living rooms.Verizon offers its own FiOS broadband TV service.Related: Verizon brings back unlimited data plans And AT&T is also making a much bigger bet on content, with plans to purchase CNN's parent company Time Warner (TWX).Verizon already owns AOL and is looking to buy the core assets of Yahoo to bolster its own digital content offerings.But the Yahoo (YHOO) deal could fall apart in the wake of revelations of massive data breaches at Yahoo over the past few years.Yahoo recently said it hopes that the deal with Verizon will close in the second quarter of this year.It was originally supposed to be finalized by the first quarter.However, in its latest earnings release, Verizon simply said that it "continues to work with Yahoo to assess the impact of data breaches" -- not that it expected the deal to close anytime soon.Verizon has a lot on its plate, which could be making investors nervous.In addition to the Yahoo deal, the company is also in the process of buying the fiber optic network of XO Communications.And it's selling its data center business to Equinix (EQIX).There also have been rumors in the past few weeks that Verizon might even consider buying cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR).That may be more than Verizon can realistically handle right now.But nothing may be off the table for Verizon given how competitive the wireless world is these days.Anything that could give Verizon a leg up on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile might be possible.Related: Charter shares popped on report of possible Verizon takeover Still, it's worth noting that shares of AT&T are lower this year too, down about 5%.And Verizon and A&T have something in common that Sprint and T-Mobile lack -- Verizon and AT&T pay gigantic dividends.Companies that have big dividend yields haven't fared as well since Donald Trump was elected.Investors are betting on a sizable stimulus package from him and the Republican Congress, which may be fueled in part by debt.That's caused bond yields to rise -- and that makes shares of big dividend payers like Verizon a lot less attractive.The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates a few times this year too.That could push bond yields even higher.So Verizon faces many big challenges that could hurt its stock this year.That's why Verizon, nicknamed Big Red because of its logo's crimson hue, may see its stock in the red for the foreseeable future.
Oil prices have doubled in a year. Here's why:::::It's a good day for OPEC.Data published Monday by the oil cartel show its members have largely complied with an agreement to slash production.The confirmation caps a remarkable year for OPEC, which was forced to devise a plan to boost prices after they fell to $26 per barrel in February 2016.The price collapse -- to levels not seen since 2003 -- was caused by months of growing oversupply, slowing demand from China and a decision by Western powers to lift Iran's nuclear sanctions.Since then, the market has mounted a stunning turnaround, with crude prices doubling to trade at $53.50 per barrel.Here's how major oil producers worked together to push prices higher: OPEC deal OPEC agreed major production cuts in November, hoping to tame the global oil oversupply and support prices.The news of the deal immediately boosted prices by 9%.Investors cheered even more after several non-OPEC producers, including Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, joined the effort to restrain supply.Crucially, the deal has stuck.The OPEC report published Monday showed that its members have -- for the most part -- fulfilled their pledges to slash production.The International Energy Agency agrees: It estimated OPEC compliance for January at 90%.UAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei told CNNMoney on Monday that the results were even better than he had expected.The production cuts total 1.8 million barrels per day and are scheduled to run for six months.Related: OPEC has pulled off one of its 'deepest' production cuts Investors upbeat The OPEC deal took months to negotiate, and investors really, really like it.The number of hedge funds and other institutional investors that are betting on higher prices hit a record in January, according to OPEC.The widespread optimism is helping to fuel price increases.Higher demand The latest data from OPEC and the IEA show that global demand for oil was higher than expected in 2016, thanks to stronger economic growth, higher vehicle sales and colder than expected weather in the final quarter of the year.Demand is set to grow further in 2017 to an average of 95.8 million barrels a day, compared 94.6 million barrels per day in 2016.The IEA said that if OPEC sticks to its agreement, the global oil glut that has plagued markets for three years will finally disappear in 2017.Saudi oil minister: I don't lose sleep over shale What's next?Despite the stunning growth, analysts caution that prices may not go much higher.That's because higher oil prices are likely to lure American shale producers back into the market.The total number of active oil rigs in the U.S. stood at 591 last week, according to data from Baker Hughes.That's 152 more than a year ago.U.S. crude stockpiles swelled in January to nearly 200 million barrels above their five-year average, according to the OPEC report."This vast increase in inventories is a result of a strong supply response from the U.S. shale producers, who were not involved in the OPEC agreement and who have instead been using the resultant price rally to increase output," said Fiona Cincotta, an analyst at City Index.More supply could once again put OPEC under pressure.
Tesla is going to sell electric cars in the Middle East:::::Tesla is bringing its electric cars to the heart of the oil producing world.The automaker announced Monday that its first official venture in the Middle East will be in the United Arab Emirates.The first cars -- the Model S and Model X -- will hit the road this summer."Timing seems to be good to really make a significant debut in this region starting in Dubai," Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk said at the World Government Summit in Dubai.Tesla owners will have access to two existing supercharging stations in the UAE, and Telsa plans to open five more by the end of the year.Despite sitting on huge oil and gas reserves, the UAE has ambitious plans to go green.Last month it said it will invest $163 billion to boost alternative energy use over the next three decades.Related: Tesla reveals what it will charge for a charge It's the latest in a series of expansion announcements for Tesla.Last week, Musk hinted that Tesla may soon come to India.Musk has also teased plans to build "heavy-duty trucks and high passenger-density urban transport" as well developing a ride-hailing network, which could be similar to Uber.Speaking in Dubai, the entrepreneur expounded on the future of robotics."We will see autonomy and artificial intelligence advance tremendously," Musk said."In probably 10 years, it will be very unusual for cars to be built that are not fully autonomous."Related: Elon Musk's surprising secret weapon: Trump?But he also warned of the "disruptive" nature of autonomous vehicles."That disruption I'm talking about will take place over about 20 years.Still, 20 years is a short period of time to have something like 12% to 15% of the workforce be unemployed."Musk said governments must pay close attention to artificial intelligence, create sustainable transport and be wary of mass unemployment."This will be a massive social challenge.Ultimately, we need to think about universal basic income.I don't think we have a choice," he said."There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better."-- Seth Fiegerman contributed reporting.
Indian rival slams Uber's business model:::::Uber's top rival in India has some unsolicited advice for the U.S. startup: Go local."They have a very cookie-cutter approach in terms of what the model is and how [to] force feed it into any geography," Pranay Jivrajka, a top executive at Ola Cabs, said on the sidelines of CNN's Asia Business Forum in Bangalore.Jivrajka, who until recently served as Ola's COO, said that Uber should ditch its one-size-fits-all approach and instead try to understand "local nuances" that would help it to identify services that "users and drivers actually want."Uber declined to comment on Jivrajka's remarks.Uber and Ola have for years waged a bitter battle for supremacy in India, a market with 1.3 billion potential customers.The country has taken on increased significance for Uber after a series of recent setbacks elsewhere in Asia.The San Francisco-based company suspended its operations in Taiwan last week, six months after it sold its operations in China to local rival Didi Chuxing.Didi, which is taking the fight to Uber in key foreign markets, is one of Ola's investors.In India, Uber has often found itself playing catch-up with its Bangalore-based rival.Its most recent local product offering -- allowing Indian users to book a car for an entire day -- is already offered by Ola in 85 cities.Ola also lets users book one of India's ubiquitous three-wheeled auto rickshaws, a service Uber started but then discontinued in 2015."What has helped us is having an ear to the ground in terms of understanding what the users want," said Jivrajka.Related: Uber's rivals are teaming up in Asia Uber CEO Travis Kalanick insists that his company is not prepared to leave India."We are losing, but we see a path towards profitability," Kalanick said during a December visit to Delhi."We see ourselves being here in the long run."Related: Uber suspends its service in Taiwan as fines mount India isn't always a straightforward market for either company -- tens of thousands of drivers representing both Uber and Ola went on strike in Delhi this week, demanding better pay and benefits.The Delhi government has offered to mediate the dispute.Jivrajka did not comment on the protests, but said that Ola's main focus remains bringing more drivers onto its platform."We need more drivers because the pace at which demand is increasing is way higher than the way supply is getting aggregated," he said.Related: Uber CEO drops out of Trump's business advisory council Jivrajka also had some advice for another Silicon Valley giant hoping to enter India: electric automaker Tesla."There are no rules on the Indian roads," Jivrajka said."One thing a lot of people say is that if you can drive in India, you can drive anywhere."-- Manveena Suri contributed reporting
Apple CEO Tim Cook calls for "massive campaign" against fake news:::::Apple CEO Tim Cook wants the tech industry to take action against "fake news" stories that are polluting the web."There has to be a massive campaign.We have to think through every demographic," Cook said in a rare interview.Speaking with The Daily Telegraph newspaper, Cook also said "all of us technology companies need to create some tools that help diminish the volume of fake news."Other leading tech company CEOs, like Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, have spoken about the problem in recent months.But Cook's comments were much more frank.According to the Telegraph, he said made-up stories and hoaxes are "killing people's minds."And he called the "fake news" plague "a big problem in a lot of the world."The term "fake news" was originally coined to describe online stories that are designed to deceive readers.Often times these stories are shared on Facebook and other social networking sites to generate profits for the creators.Other times the stories are essentially propaganda made up for political purposes.These kinds of stories received widespread attention before and after the American election.Fictional stories with titles like "Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for president" won millions of clicks.It can be very difficult for web surfers to tell the difference between legitimate news sources and fakes.That's where companies like Apple come in.In the Telegraph interview -- part of a multi-day European trip -- Cook said "too many of us are just in the complain category right now and haven't figured out what to do."He urged both technological and intellectual solutions."We need the modern version of a public-service announcement campaign.It can be done quickly if there is a will," Cook told the newspaper.What he described is music to the ears of media literacy advocates."It's almost as if a new course is required for the modern kid, for the digital kid," Cook said.There are scattered efforts in some schools to teach media literacy, with a focus on digital skills, but it is by no means universal.When asked if Apple would commit to funding a PSA campaign, an Apple spokesman said the company had no further comment on Cook's interview.The Apple CEO also suggested that tech companies can help weed out fake stories, though he added, "We must try to squeeze this without stepping on freedom of speech and of the press."Apple's own Apple News app has been credited with being a relatively reliable place to find information.The company "reviews publishers who join Apple News," BuzzFeed noted last December.And the app has a "report-a-concern function where users can flag fake news or hate speech."Facebook recently started working with fact-checkers to test "warning labels" that show up when users share made-up stories.Cook, in the newspaper interview, expressed optimism that the "fake news" plague is a "short-term thing -- I don't believe that people want that at the end of the day."
Trump brand takes another hit:::::Nordstrom.Neiman Marcus.TJ Maxx.And now, Sears and Kmart.Sears Holdings, the company that owns retail stores Sears and Kmart, reportedly said this weekend that it would remove 31 Trump-branded items from its website.The company pulled the products as part of a plan to focus on its "most profitable items," Sears spokesman Brian Hanover told Reuters.Hanover told the news organization that items in the Trump Home line of furnishings were removed from the company's website, although they could still be purchased through third-party vendors online.Neither store carried the items in their physical stores, he said.Searches of the Sears and KMart websites did not turn up Trump Home products, except for those sold by third-party vendors.In a statement Monday, spokesman Chris Brathwaite distanced Sears from any political controversy and reiterated that many Trump-branded products are still available through third-party sellers."In this case, certain products were removed from our websites that included a very small number of Trump products," he said."The headlines do not do justice to our business or this specific brand of products that we offer through our marketplace sellers."Brathwaite added that the company prefers to focus on its business and "leave the politics to others."Related: Is Ivanka Trump's brand losing its bling?The move makes Sears the latest to ditch products bearing the Trump name.Earlier this month, Nordstrom (JWN) cited brand "performance," not politics, as the reason why it decided to stop carrying Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories label.President Trump knocked the department store on Twitter in retaliation.Nordstrom stock jumped 7% in the first two days following the tweet.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom.She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing!Terrible!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Other stores have also sought to distance themselves from Ivanka Trump's brand.Neiman Marcus removed the brand landing page from its website, and declined to tell CNNMoney whether it intended to keep Ivanka Trump products in stores or resume online sales in the future.TJX Companies (TJX), the company that owns TJ Maxx and Marshalls, also said that it had recently told workers not to highlight the first daughter's brand in stores.And retailer Belk said last week that it planned to pull Ivanka Trump's products from its website, but would continue to offer the line in its flagship stores.Ivanka Trump's clothing and accessories line has taken a hit in recent months.Online sales of her brand dipped 26% in January compared to a year earlier, according to Slice Intelligence, a retail analysis firm.Slice studied the brand's sales on five online stores: Nordstrom, Amazon, Zappos, Macy's and Bloomingdale's.Online sales of Ivanka's brand had surged in late 2015, and last month's numbers appear to be more of a "return to reality," according to Taylor Stanton, Slice's marketing and communications manager.The brand's dip in performance was abnormal in light of an uptick in 2016 online sales in the apparel and accessories category, said Jack Beckwythe, a Slice analyst.Related: Kellyanne Conway unrepentant for Ivanka Trump plug The Ivanka Trump brand has defended its performance.Rosemary Young, senior director of marketing at Ivanka Trump, told CNNMoney last week that the brand was growing and experienced "significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016.""We believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains," Young said.Retailers like Bloomingdale's, Amazon (AMZN), Lord & Taylor, Macy's (M) and Zappos all still carry Ivanka Trump products.Ivanka Trump has taken a leave of absence from her namesake company since her father won the presidency.She has no formal role in the administration but is expected to have a voice on issues such as women's empowerment and child care.--CNNMoney's Jackie Wattles contributed to this story.
This company makes food packaging out of bamboo to cut down on trash:::::To tackle Thailand's mounting trash problem, one company is turning to the country's plant life.Universal Biopack makes packaging that it sells to restaurants and manufacturers.But rather than plastic, it uses a mixture of bamboo and cassava, crops that are widely found across the country.After growing rapidly in recent decades, Thailand has become one of Asia's biggest economies.But like many other countries in the region, it's been slow to try to combat the millions of tons of trash produced each year."Waste management is a big problem everywhere," said Universal Biopack's managing director, Vara-Anong Vichakyothin.Related: The company turning 4 billion plastic bottles into clothes The company is using a technology devised at a Bangkok university to make its zero-waste packaging.It hopes it will eventually replace many of the Styrofoam boxes and plastic bags that end up in huge garbage dumps across Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries.Its eco-friendly formula took five years to develop and is so adaptable it could end up being used to package things like furniture and even phones.The bamboo it uses comes from leftover scraps from the chopstick manufacturing process.In the cities of Bangkok and Chiang Mai, where takeout drink containers and noodle packets line the sidewalks, the company supplies restaurants, organic farmers and other businesses in the food and drink industry.But finding new clients can be tricky.Takeout food vendors in Thailand want to keep costs down in a competitive business with thin margins.Asking them to spend more on packaging for environmental reasons is a tough sell."The local economy still does not support [this technology]" said Universal Biopack's founder, Suthep Vichakyothin.But that hasn't stopping other companies from entering the sustainable packaging market in Thailand.Like Universal Biopack, they're betting on growing environmental awareness eventually leading to an increase in demand.To become more competitive, Suthep's company is investing.It's aiming to ramp up production by building a partially automated assembly line at its factory near Bangkok and doubling its staffing from 50 people to 100.The goal is to increase monthly capacity from 300,000 units to one million.Related: A startup that makes pencils that grow into vegetables A lot of the demand comes from overseas.One of its customers uses the natural packaging for coconut water it exports.Universal Biopack says it's also getting interest in its products from other countries, particularly in Scandinavia.
LeBron, Serena and other Nike stars champion 'Equality':::::Nike says it's time to stand up for equality in a new ad campaign.The company on Sunday launched a star-studded short film titled "Equality" to mark Black History Month.The ad features Nike-sponsored athletes LeBron James, Serena Williams, Kevin Durant, Gabby Douglas, among others, "amplifying their voices in an effort to uplift, open eyes and bring the positive values that sport can represent into wider focus," the company said.Actor Michael B. Jordan voices the film, and singer Alicia Keys performs a rendition of Sam Cooke's "A Change is Gonna Come."If we can be equals in sport, we can be equals everywhere.#EQUALITY pic.twitter.com/ki5NaJN12d Nike (@Nike) February 12, 2017 "Is this the land history promised?"Jordan says."Here, within these lines, on this concrete court, this patch of turf, here, you're defined by your actions -- not your looks or beliefs."Nike will feature ads from the campaign on social media, billboards and posters throughout cities in the United States and Canada.It will also sell "Equality" branded T-shirts and shoes as part of its annual Black History Month collection.Apparel from the campaign will be worn by Nike athletes during NBA All-Star weekend.Nike said it is donating $5 million this year to organizations like MENTOR and PeacePlayers, which it says "advance equality in communities" across the country.Related: Pro-Trump boycott calls follow Super Bowl ads Nike's new campaign comes one week after numerous companies launched ads about inclusion and acceptance during the Super Bowl.Budweiser, 84 Lumber, Coca-Cola (COKE), Airbnb, Kia and Tiffany (TIF) were among the brands that features messages about immigration, equality and environmentalism.-- CNNMoney's Ahiza Garcia contributed to this story.
'Lego Batman' producer today. Treasury secretary tomorrow?:::::Steven Mnuchin had a pretty good weekend.First the treasury secretary pick advanced a step closer toward confirmation on Friday.Then his latest movie claimed the top spot at the box office.Mnuchin is an executive producer on Warner Bros.' "The Lego Batman Movie," which pulled in an estimated $55.6 million from U.S. audiences during its opening weekend.CNN, like Warner Bros., is owned by Time Warner.The kid-friendly spinoff of 2014's "The Lego Movie" handily beat its raunchy competitor, Universal's "Fifty Shades Darker."The sequel to 2015's "Fifty Shades of Grey," based on a best-selling series of romance novels, debuted at $46.8 million in the United States.Related: Possible pick for Treasury secretary makes his film debut Mnuchin is listed as a producer or executive producer on 34 films in recent years, including last summer's "Suicide Squad," which brought in $786 million worldwide.He also produced "The Lego Ninjago Movie," another Lego franchise spinoff that will hit screens this fall.Mnuchin is widely expected to be serving as Treasury secretary by then.Following a 53-46 vote last Friday to break a Democratic filibuster, Mnuchin is scheduled for a final vote before the full Senate at 7 p.m. Monday.--CNNMoney's Frank Pallotta and CNN's Ashley Killough contributed to this story.
The last thing Europe needs: another Greek crisis:::::How's this for dj vu?Another debt crisis is brewing in Europe.Greece needs European creditors to release cash from a bailout agreed in 2015 so it can make debt repayments, but officials are at loggerheads.Investors are starting to worry, demanding higher returns on Greek debt.Adding to the confusion is a warning from the International Monetary Fund that Greece's debt is unsustainable and on an "explosive" path, an assessment that prevents the fund from participating in a rescue.The timing could hardly be worse.European leaders have a lot on their plate.Elections are looming in the Netherlands, France and Germany.Brexit negotiations will begin within weeks.Yet the threat of Greece tumbling out of the euro demands attention.Here's why the next few weeks will be key: Hammer to fall Greece is running out of cash, but it needs to make repayments to creditors including the European Central Bank.Major bills are coming due in July.If Greece cannot make the payments, it will default on its debt and spiral out of the eurozone.Meanwhile, its latest bailout -- the third since 2010 -- is effectively frozen.The negotiating positions of major players are further apart than at any point since the bailout was agreed in June, 2015.There is even disagreement over the size of the problem facing Greece."The IMF's latest review of Greece's debt position was surprisingly pessimistic," said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs meetings of top eurozone finance officials."It's surprising because Greece is already doing better than that report describes."I want it all The IMF, Greece and creditors led by Germany all have very different priorities.Here's what each wants: The IMF has called on Greece to make more ambitious changes to its economy, including labor market reforms.The IMF didn't join the third bailout when first agreed in 2015 because it did not view Greece's debt as being sustainable.It still maintains that Greece cannot be self sustaining without major debt relief.Greece's main creditors agree that Athens should implement the reforms proposed by the IMF.However, they have categorically ruled out any debt relief, a position reiterated by eurozone finance officials on Tuesday.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, meanwhile, shows no sign of yielding to demands for additional reforms.He insists that debt relief is needed before any new concessions are made.It's a classic standoff and investors are watching to see which party blinks first.Put out the fire The next major milestone is a meeting of eurozone finance ministers on Feb. 20 -- the last before elections start muddying Europe's political waters.Agreeing yet more financial aid for Greece will become even harder once voters start casting their ballots.After that, bills will start coming due.Greece faces a payment to the ECB of roughly 1.4 billion in late April and another 4.1 billion in July.The stake are high.The unemployment rate in Greece is expected to run above 21% in 2017.Investment is down by more than 60% and output has contracted by more than 25% since the financial crisis.The country's social fabric is fraying.If European creditors refuse further help, Greece's debt will spiral out of control no matter how quickly its economy grows, according to the IMF.That will leave only one option -- abandoning the euro.Ted Malloch, President Trump's expected choice for U.S. ambassador to the EU, told Greek television on Tuesday that the eurozone's future would be decided in the next 18 months."Certainly there will be a Europe, whether the eurozone survives, I think it's very much a question that is on the agenda," he said."I think this time I would have to say that the odds are higher that Greece itself will break out of the euro."
Verizon is bringing back unlimited data:::::Verizon VZ Starting Monday, Verizon customers can get unlimited data, talk and text for $80.The company says the new introductory plan also includes up to 10 GB of mobile hotspot usage, as well as calling and texting to Mexico and Canada.It will also allow customers to stream unlimited HD video, thumbing its nose at T-Mobile's controversial practice of lowering video quality for some of its unlimited data customers.Although the new Verizon plan promises "fast LTE speeds," those using a lot of data may suffer.The company said that after a customer uses 22 gb of data on a line during any billing cycle, it "may prioritize usage behind other customers in the event of network congestion."That has become standard practice on all networks that offer unlimited data plans.Related: T-Mobile and Sprint offer new 'unlimited' data plans -- sort of Verizon first eliminated its version of an unlimited usage plan in 2011, following similar decisions by other major wireless carriers.But companies have been steadily reviving such plans.Verizon first overhauled its data-usage plans last summer when it introduced a new "Safety Mode" plan.That technically gave customers access to unlimited data, but they were subjected to slow-as-molasses speeds after they went over their allotted data.AT&T similarly eliminated overage fees for customers in September.Like Verizon, AT&T throttles customers speeds once they reach the data limit on their plans.The company brought back unlimited plans earlier last year, but it is only available for homes with both AT&T's wireless phone service and either DirecTV or U-Verse TV.Meanwhile, competitors T-Mobile (TMUS) and Sprint (S) made their own bids to attract customers looking for "unlimited data" plans.Nearly all NYC subways get cell service Last August, Sprint began offering a plan to give customers unlimited talk, text and high-speed data for $60 for the first line, $40 for the next, and $30 for each additional up to 10.The T-Mobile plan, announced the same day as Sprint's, charged $70 a month for the first line, the second at $50 and additional lines are only $20, up to eight lines.
Visa crackdown puts these rural doctors at risk:::::At his pediatrics practice in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Dr. Alaa Al Nofal sees up to 10 patients a day.He's known some of them since they were born.Others, he still treats after they've graduated from high school."I treat these children for Type 1 diabetes, thyroid problems, thyroid cancer, puberty disorders and adrenal gland diseases," he said.Al Nofal's expertise is critical.He is one of just five full-time pediatric endocrinologists in a 150,000 square-mile area that covers both South and North Dakota.Like most of rural America, it's a region plagued by a shortage of doctors."We're very lucky to have Dr. Al Nofal here.We can't afford to lose someone with his specialization," said Cindy Morrison, chief marketing officer for Sanford Health, a non-profit health care system based in Sioux Falls that runs 300 hospitals and clinics in predominantly rural communities.Related: Visa ban could make doctor shortage in rural America even worse Yet, Sanford Health may lose Al Nofal and several other doctors who are crucial to its health care network.A Syrian citizen, Al Nofal is in Sioux Falls through a special workforce development program called the Conrad 30 visa waiver -- which basically waives the requirement that doctors who complete their residency on a J-1 exchange visitor visa must return to their country of origin for two years before applying for another American visa.The Conrad 30 waiver allows him to stay in the U.S. for a maximum of three years as long as he commits to practicing in an area where there is a doctor shortage.After President Donald Trump issued a temporary immigration ban restricting people from seven Muslim-majority countries -- including Syria -- from entering the U.S., Al Nofal is unsure about his future in America."We agree that something more has to be done to protect the country, but this executive order will have a negative effect on physicians from these countries who are badly needed across America," said Al Nofal."They may no longer want to practice in the United States."The action is currently in legal limbo after a federal appeals court temporarily halted the ban.Related: Trump furious after court upholds block on travel ban Over the last 15 years, the Conrad 30 visa waiver has funneled 15,000 foreign physicians into underserved communities.Sanford Health has 75 physicians in total on these visa waivers and seven are from the countries listed in the executive order."If we lost Dr. Al Nofal and our other J-1 physicians, we would be unable to fill critical gaps in access to health care for rural families," said Sanford Health's Morrison.And the ban could hurt the pipeline of new doctors, too.The Conrad 30 visa waiver program is fed by medical school graduates holding J-1 non-immigrant visas who have completed their residencies in the U.S. More than 6,000 medical trainees from foreign countries enroll every year in U.S. residency programs through J-1 visas.About 1,000 of these trainees are from countries caught up in the ban, according to the American Association of Medical Colleges.J-1 visa holders who were out of the country when the ban went into effect were prohibited from entering the U.S. and unable to start or finish school as long as the ban is in place.The State Department told CNNMoney that the government may issue J-1 visas to people who are from one of the blocked countries if it is of "national interest," but would not confirm whether a doctor shortage would qualify for such consideration."The stress and concern generated by the short-term executive order could have long-term implications, with fewer physicians choosing training programs in the states and subsequently magnifying the deficit in providers willing to practice in underserved and rural areas," said Dr. Larry Dial, vice dean for clinical affairs at Marshall University's school of medicine in Huntington, West Virginia.Related: Obamacare's impact on this Alaska town with only one doctor's office Al Nofal went to medical school in Damascus, Syria's capital, and completed his residency at the University of Texas on a J-1 visa.He proceeded to a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic and then applied for a J-1 waiver, which placed him in Sioux Falls.Nineteen months into his three-year commitment, Al Nofal is either directly treating or serving as a consulting physician to more than 400 pediatric patients a month on average.He sees most of his patients at the Sanford Children's Specialty Clinic in Sioux Falls, where families often drive hours for an appointment.Once a month, he flies in a small plane to see patients in a clinic in Aberdeen, about 200 miles away."It's not easy being a doctor in this setting," said Al Nofal, citing the long hours and South Dakota's famously frigid winters."But as a physician, I'm trained to help people whatever the circumstances and I'm proud of it."It's one of the reasons why Al Nofal and his American wife Alyssa have struggled to come to terms with the visa ban."I have a 10-month old baby and I can't travel to Syria now.My family in Syria can't come here," he said."Now my family can't meet their first grandson.""I know if we leave I probably can never come back," he said.Neither does he want to travel anywhere in the country right now."I'm afraid of how I will be treated," he said.He's also afraid he will be stopped at the airport -- even if he's traveling to another state.Related: Trump travel ban and what you need to know Almatmed Abdelsalam, who's from Benghazi, Libya, had planned to start practicing as a family physician in Macon, Georgia, through the visa waiver program after he completed his residency at the University of Central Florida's College of Medicine in July.Everything was going smoothly.Abdelsalam, who treats hospital patients and veterans, applied for the visa waiver and was accepted.He signed an employment contract with Magna Care, which provides physicians to three hospitals in the Macon area and he had started looking at houses to relocate himself, his wife and their two young kids over the summer.But there was one last step.For his J-1 waiver application to be fully completed, it needs to get final approval from the State Department and the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services."The executive order came in the middle of that process, stalling my application at the State Department," he said.Because he's a Libyan citizen (Libya is also subject to the visa ban), Abdelsalam is fearful of the outcome."The hospital in Macon urgently needs doctors.Even though they've hired me, I'm not sure how long they can wait for me," he said."No one can argue it's necessary to keep the country safe, but we should also keep the country healthy," he said."Doctors like me, trained in the U.S. at some of the best schools, are an asset not a liability."
Trump isn't killing the bull market. Here's why:::::More and more business leaders and Wall Street strategists are expressing their worries about what President Donald Trump's protectionist policies and unpredictable nature might do to the markets and economy.But we all know that action speaks louder than words.What investors are actually doing is in stark contrast to what people are saying.The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs again on Friday.And the Russell 2000, an index of small company stocks that tend to do most of their business in the U.S., is now just a few points away from the all-time high it hit last December in the wake of Trump market euphoria.What's more, the VIX (VIX), a measure of volatility known as Wall Street's fear gauge, is down nearly 25% this year as well.If investors were really scared of Trump, the VIX should be much higher.And CNNMoney's own Fear & Greed Index, which looks at the VIX and six other measures of investor sentiment, is showing signs of Greed and is not far from Extreme Greed levels.Of course, Trump still can't seem to help himself from tweeting about things that, let's be honest, won't do anything to help the economy -- although Nordstrom investors are richer despite Trump attacking them for dumping his daughter Ivanka's brand.But to give credit where it's due, it looks like the main reason that stocks have taken off again lately is because Trump has promised to unveil a "phenomenal" tax plan soon.Related: Rare streak for U.S. stocks: Long stretch without a 1% dive Trump also pledged again to invest more on infrastructure when he met with airline CEOs on Thursday.That's what the market wants to hear."We still expect fiscal stimulus, lower taxes and less regulation," said Matt Lockridge, manager of the Westwood Small Cap Value Fund."The timing is the big question, but it's coming."Lockridge thinks that many companies that generate a majority of their revenues from America should benefit if Trump stimulus winds up kicking the economy into a higher gear.He likes stocks in a variety of industries, such as movie theater owner Masco (MAS), snack food firm J & J (JJSF) and aerospace equipment company Kaman (KAMN).Another money manager said he's also still bullish on small U.S. stocks that could get a lift from Trump policies.Related: Wall Street has powerful seat at Trump's table Barry James, president and CEO of James Investment Research, said he bought the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) the day after the election because he's confident Trump's stimulus plan will boost growth for U.S small businesses."When Trump said America first, I really think that's what he means," James said, adding that he thinks Internet phone service Vonage (VG), rent-to-own retailer Aaron's (AAN) and discount chain Big Lots (BIG) could all thrive if Trump's proposals go through.But there's another reason why the U.S. markets are near all-time highs.Despite all of the uncertainty in Washington, the U.S. is still viewed as a paragon of relative stability compared to other parts of the world.Europe's economy is still a big wild card thanks to Brexit, the rise of populism in France leading to worries about a so-called Frexit and more worries about the problem that never seems to go away -- Greece's debt woes.Japan's economy remains stagnant as well.We're talking about more than just a lost decade now.It's plural.And China's economy is slowing down too.Bond fund manager Bill Gross has often joked that America is like what Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson sang about in "Sunday Morning Coming Down" -- the "cleanest dirty shirt."To that end, analysts at bond rating firm Fitch wrote in a report Friday that "elements of President Trump's economic agenda would be positive for growth," but added that "the present balance of risks points toward a less benign global outcome."Of course, there are two sides to that coin.Trump's bombast could come back to haunt him.Related: Oreo make is worried about rise of populism His continued penchant for reprimanding companies that he disagrees with on Twitter could dent investor confidence.And while his proposed travel ban on immigrants from seven mostly Muslim countries has been overturned by the U.S. court system for now, the president has vowed to fight for its reinstatement.Even if he loses that battle, it's still clear that Trump is serious on turning more inward, with plans for tariffs and border-adjusted taxes that could ignite trade wars with Mexico, China and Japan.That could hurt big U.S. multinational firms and lead to job cuts.But investors still seem to believe/hope that the merits of Trump's pro-growth stimulus plans and tax cuts will outweigh the impact of isolationism.Let's hope they're right.Investors may be holding their noses, closing their eyes and stuffing cotton in their ears to drown out the president.But they are still buying stocks.
'I feel refreshed': Brits embrace multiple careers:::::Image copyright Sam Gray Image caption Sam Grey working in security - one of her many jobs More than 320,500 self-employed people in Britain are working two or more jobs, new analysis suggests.A study by the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) - seen by 5 Live's Wake Up To Money - shows that 7% have launched an additional business.Some call it a portfolio career or a multi-hyphenate career.One term that seems to be sticking is "slashie", as in: "I am a chef/blogger/dog walker."'A positive choice' Sam Grey is a so-called "slashie", although she dislikes that term and would rather be known as a "Jack of all trades".She's a former teacher living in Torquay, and currently works five different jobs.In addition to her own dog-grooming business, Toodles, Sam works as a private tutor, teaches crochet and sells patterns, works security for nightclubs and bars and works two 12-hour night shifts at a local arcade.While she initially took on multiple roles by necessity, she says she now enjoys this way of working."As a full-time teacher your job never ends.There is this constant feeling that you could and should be doing more.But with lots of different jobs I have to switch off, I have to stop thinking about what I was doing, because I am getting paid to do something else.Image copyright Sam Grey Image caption Sam Grey runs a dog-grooming business, alongside other roles "It is a positive choice.If I just worked in a dog grooming salon all day I think I'd probably go a little bit mad, dogs aren't great for conversation.And I love teaching, so tutoring really fills that gap for me."'Multifaceted by nature' Working more than one job because money is tight is not new, but many "slashies" appear to be doing so for more personal, creative reasons.It's also a bit different to a side-hustle, which is where someone turns their hobby outside their main job into a money-making venture.Many are successful enough to be able to leave their full-time employment to become a "slashie".Research carried out by Henley Business School found that one in four workers are running at least one business alongside their main careers.Chlo Jepps, deputy head of research at IPSE, says that for most people it is a choice, not a necessity."It's to pursue a passion, try something new and get some extra income while doing something they love," she explains.But it's also a way to trial a new business: "You can test a new idea without leaping straight into it and try things without taking the full risk."Emma Gannon believes this way of working simply suits many people better, by giving them outlets for different interests.She's a journalist, podcaster and author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, which provides advice on how to manage multiple careers.She says: "In America, it was always cool to have another role on the side, but in the UK there's a stigma around being a 'Jack of all trades'.Image copyright Patrick Balls Image caption Author Emma Gannon helps 'slashies' navigate their working lives "From school and university, we're told to pick one thing and become an expert, but the job-for-life isn't possible anymore, even if you want that."Humans are multifaceted by nature, we have many interests and now we're feeling braver about embracing that."Emma is confident that rather than "working in a way that suits the Victorian era, working at a machine for fixed hours", many more will choose to have a concurrent careers.But she says these "slashie" pioneers are at risk of burnout."The flip side of enjoying your job can be that you end up working 24 hours a day.There's an increasing trend of merging your job and your life, and if you've got a few different gigs then even more so."There isn't enough support for people working this way.The admin side of things can be quite intense, more so if you're running more than one business."For "slashie" Sam Gray, a change is simply as good as a rest."I feel refreshed by how I work now," she says."I don't do anything long enough to get bored with it, everything just feels new."
Which? survey reveals customers' least favourite mobile network:::::Image copyright Getty Images Vodafone has been rated as the UK's worst mobile network provider for the eighth year in a row, in consumer lobby group Which?'s eighth annual survey.EE and O2 also finished in the bottom three.Virtual network provider Giffgaff came top of the poll, ahead of Utility Warehouse and Plusnet Mobile.Which?said the study proved that good "customer service" and "value for money" were important to people.Vodafone said it was "sorry" that Which?members were unhappy with them.In a statement, the company added: "We are working hard to understand the issue and what more we can do."In all, 13 networks were included in the survey of 6,135 Which?members in February.The survey said Vodafone had collected one-star ratings for customer service, value for money and technical support.One in five of its customers told Which?that "customer service, including complaints handling and the way their queries were dealt with, was poor".Only 27% of EE customers said they had received good or excellent service for technical support, while one in 10 O2 customers rated the value for money they received as "poor".An EE spokeswoman said: "We're ranked top by OpenSignal for mobile experience in the UK, which is supported by other independent reports from Ofcom and RootMetrics."Ofcom's latest figures also show that EE receives among the fewest complaints in the mobile industry, as we've continued to invest in the UK's best customer service."'Shop around' Nearly all Giffgaff customers said it was "good or excellent" for value for money, adding they would recommend it to friends and family.Sim-only deals proved on average 31% (3.56 a month) more expensive with the Big Four providers (EE, O2, Vodafone and Three).The same was true for the average monthly contract price for an iPhone XS, which was 18% more (10.11) with the Big Four, while a Samsung Galaxy S10 was 6% more expensive (3.22).Natalie Hitchins, Which?head of home products and services, said: "The continuing reign of smaller networks over the big players goes to show exactly how important customer support and value for money are to mobile users."If you think you're paying too much or are not getting the level of service you expect from your provider, you should shop around for a better deal - you might find you save yourself some money and probably a lot of grief, too."
More than half of British firms 'report cyber-attacks in 2019':::::Image copyright Getty Images The proportion of UK firms reporting a cyber-attack has jumped, despite most businesses admitting they are under-prepared for breaches, according to research from Hiscox.The insurer found 55% had faced an attack in 2019, up from 40% last year.But almost three quarters of firms were ranked as "novices" in terms of cyber readiness.Hiscox said a lot of businesses "incorrectly felt that they weren't at risk".The firm surveyed more than 5,400 small, medium and large businesses across seven countries, including the UK, Germany, the US, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Spain.It said there had been a "sharp increase" in the number of cyber-attacks this year, with more than 60% of firms having reported one or more attacks - up from 45% in 2018.Average losses from breaches also soared from $229,000 (176,000) to $369,000, an increase of 61%.Despite this, the insurer said the percentage of firms scoring top marks on cyber security had fallen, with UK organisations doing particularly badly.British firms had the lowest cyber security budgets, it said, spending less than $900,000 on average compared with $1.46m across the group.They were also joint-least likely with US firms to have a "defined role for cyber security" on their staff.In France the proportion was closer to one in ten.Gareth Wharton, head of Cyber at Hiscox, said the low UK spending could be driven by the large number of small businesses in Britain."They may feel like they won't be targeted, as we tend to only read about large breaches in the press.If they incorrectly feel that they won't be targeted, they may be less likely to spend on cyber security."However, Hiscox also found the average cost of an attack in the UK was lower than average at $243,000, compared with $906,000 in Germany and $486,000 in Belgium.New regulation has also prompted action, with eight in ten UK firms saying they had made changes since the introduction of tough new EU data protection rules last year.
Britain breaks coal-free power record over Easter weekend:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The government has set a target to phase out coal power by 2025 Britain has broken its record for the longest continuous period without generating electricity from coal.National Grid said that the coal-free period lasted more than 90 hours before coming to an end on Monday afternoon.It is the longest period since the industrial revolution and breaks the previous record set in April 2018 of 76 hours and 10 minutes.The government plans to phase out Britain's last coal power plants by 2025 to cut greenhouse gases.Duncan Burt, director of operations at National Grid, told BBC Radio 5 Live it was "a really big deal"."It's all about the sunny weather we've been seeing, so energy demand is low.There has been lots of lovely solar power off the panels too."Image copyright PA Image caption The sunny weather has led to low energy demand and a boost in solar power He said the UK generated a quarter of its energy from solar over the Easter weekend, with similar portions from nuclear and gas.The rest was imported from Europe.In April, 2017 Britain went its first full day without coal since the 19th century.Coal made up less than 10% of the country's energy mix last year and will be less than that again in 2019, according to National Grid.However, experts warned that power generated by coal was largely being replaced by gas, another fossil fuel, rather than renewable sources.They also said a reliance on gas made the UK vulnerable to the whims of international markets, and was not clean enough to meet the UK's legal targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions.The 2008 Climate Change Act requires greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050.Muna Suleiman, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: "89 hours of coal-free electricity is great but let's make this all day every day."Electricity generated by renewable sources is a key part of the fight against climate chaos so it's time to remove all the blockers to renewable energy."The government must prioritise the development of sources such as solar and onshore wind."

Herman Cain withdraws bid for Federal Reserve seat:::::Image copyright Getty/Mark Wilson Image caption Herman Cain made a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 Former Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain withdrew his name for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, US President Donald Trump has tweeted.The president said he would respect the former pizza chain executive's wishes and not pursue Mr Cain's nomination to join America's central bank."My friend Herman Cain, a truly wonderful man, has asked me not to nominate him", Mr Trump wrote.Mr Trump first announced he intended to nominate Mr Cain earlier this month.Though the president did not formally nominate Mr Cain to the seven-member board, the announcement prompted backlash among Democrats and some Republicans in Congress.Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump My friend Herman Cain, a truly wonderful man, has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board.I will respect his wishes.Herman is a great American who truly loves our Country!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2019 Report In an online column, Mr Cain says he withdrew his name from consideration because the job would mean "a pay cut" as he would have to give up most of his business interests.The president has been accused of putting forward political loyalists to the Fed.Arguably the world's most influential bank, it is traditionally an independent body.The president is a fierce critic of the central bank, and has also often called for lower interest rates - his predecessors have largely refrained from trying to sway monetary policy.Mr Cain would have required almost total Republican support in the Senate to be confirmed.As of last week, four of 53 Republican senators announced they plan to vote against him.Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Cory Gardner of Colorado and North Dakota's Kevin Cramer all indicated they would vote no on the nomination.Mr Cain, a former executive of Godfather's Pizza, made a bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012, but dropped out amid allegations of sexual misconduct, which he denied.He is often remembered for his 9-9-9 tax reform plan during his campaign, and this viral campaign video by an adviser.He served as the chairman of the Kansas City Federal Bank from 1989 to 1991.
Iran oil: US to end sanctions exemptions for major importers:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption The sanctions on Iran's oil industry have led to a sharp downturn in the country's economy US President Donald Trump has decided to end exemptions from sanctions for countries still buying oil from Iran.The White House said waivers for China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey would expire in May, after which they could face US sanctions themselves.This decision is intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the government its main source of revenue.Iran insisted the sanctions were illegal and that it had attached "no value or credibility" to the waivers.Mr Trump reinstated the sanctions last year after abandoning a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers.Under the accord, Iran agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for sanctions relief.The Trump administration hopes to compel Iran to negotiate a "new deal" that would cover not only its nuclear activities, but also its ballistic missile programme and what officials call its "malign behaviour" across the Middle East.The sanctions have led to a sharp downturn in Iran's economy, pushing the value of its currency to record lows, quadrupling its annual inflation rate, driving away foreign investors, and triggering protests.Why aren't the waivers being renewed?In November, the US reimposed sanctions on Iran's energy, ship building, shipping, and banking sectors, which officials called "the core areas" of its economy.However, six-month waivers from economic penalties were granted to the eight main buyers of Iranian crude - China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Turkey, Italy and Greece - to give them time to find alternative sources and avoid causing a shock to global oil markets.Image copyright EPA Image caption Mike Pompeo said the US was "dramatically accelerating" its pressure campaign Three of the eight buyers - Greece, Italy and Taiwan - have stopped importing Iranian oil.But the others had reportedly asked for their waivers to be extended.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Mr Trump's decision not to renew the waivers showed his administration was "dramatically accelerating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our national security objectives while maintaining well supplied global oil markets"."We stand by our allies and partners as they transition away from Iranian crude to other alternatives," he added.Skip Twitter post by @realDonaldTrump Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil.Iran is being given VERY BAD advice by @JohnKerry and people who helped him lead the U.S. into the very bad Iran Nuclear Deal.Big violation of Logan Act?Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2019 Report "We have had extensive and productive discussions with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and other major producers to ease this transition and ensure sufficient supply.This, in addition to increasing US production, underscores our confidence that energy markets will remain well supplied."Oil pressure adds to US friction By Barbara Plett Usher, BBC state department correspondent In recent weeks, Japan and South Korea have either halted or sharply decreased Iranian oil imports.Both are heavily dependent on foreign oil and Mr Pompeo said the administration had been trying to find alternatives.But Monday's move could strain relations - already tested over issues of trade and US policy towards North Korea - with these close allies.It's an even bigger problem for India, which is also under American pressure to cut oil purchases from Venezuela.Iran is one of Delhi's main oil suppliers.But India also has deep cultural and political ties with Tehran, which make it difficult to join US efforts to isolate the Islamic Republic.China is Iran's other big customer: it has slammed the US decision, saying its trade is perfectly legal, and the US has no jurisdiction to interfere.The question is whether Beijing will try to skirt sanctions through companies not tied to the US financial system.Turkey was most outspoken in lobbying for a waiver extension.Ankara argues that it badly needs the oil, that as a neighbour it can't cut ties with Iran, and that the pressure campaign won't work anyway.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country would co-ordinate with fellow oil producers to ensure "the global oil market does not go out of balance".Iranian exports are currently estimated to be below 1 million barrels per day (bpd), compared to more than 2.5 million bpd before Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear deal last May.What has been the impact on oil prices?The price of global benchmark Brent crude rose by 3.33% to $74.37 a barrel in trading on Monday - the highest since 1 November.US oil - known as West Texas Intermediate - was meanwhile up 2.90% at $65.93.In recent months, the price of oil has risen due to an agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) cartel and its allies, including Russia, to cut their output by 1.2 million bpd.How have the countries affected reacted?A spokesman for Iran's foreign ministry dismissed Mr Trump's decision, saying the country "did not and does not attach any value or credibility to the waivers".But Abbas Mousavi added that because of the sanctions' negative effects, Iran was in "constant contact" with its international partners and would act accordingly.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu tweeted that the US move would "not serve regional peace and stability, yet will harm Iranian people"."Turkey rejects unilateral sanctions and impositions on how to conduct relations with neighbours," he added.China said earlier that it opposed unilateral US sanctions."China-Iran co-operation is open, transparent and in accordance with law.It should be respected," foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters.Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, was quoted by the Financial Times as saying there should be no "negative effect on the operations of Japanese companies".Its refineries reportedly halted Iranian imports in March.India's government was studying the implications of the US announcement, the PTI news agency cited sources as saying.The country had reportedly hoped to be allowed to continue to reduce its Iranian oil imports gradually.South Korea stopped buying Iranian oil for four months in response, but resumed in January.In March, it imported 284,600 bpd.
Carlos Ghosn: Former Nissan boss hit with fresh charge:::::Image copyright Getty Images Former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn has been indicted by prosecutors in Japan on a fresh charge of aggravated breach of trust.It is the fourth charge brought against Mr Ghosn and relates to the alleged misuse of company funds.The 65-year-old is in detention in Tokyo and his lawyers have applied for bail.Mr Ghosn, who denies any wrongdoing, has said the allegations are a result of a plot against him.He was first arrested in November and spent 108 days in custody.While out on bail pending a trial, the former auto boss was re-arrested in Tokyo on 4 April.Prosecutors allege that Mr Ghosn made a multi-million-dollar payment to a Nissan distributor in Oman, and that as much as $5m (3.8m) was funnelled to an account controlled by Mr Ghosn.The company he once ran, Nissan, has filed its own criminal complaint against Mr Ghosn, accusing him of directing money from the company for his own personal enrichment.Mr Ghosn was first charged with under-reporting his pay package for the five years to 2015.In January, a new charge claimed he understated his compensation for another three years.He was also indicted on a fresh, more serious charge of breach of trust.The fall from grace for the industry titan has attracted global attention.The case has also put a spotlight on fighting within the carmaker alliance and on Japan's legal system.Mr Ghosn was the architect of the alliance formed between Japan's Nissan and French carmaker Renault, and brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016.He is credited with turning around the fortunes of Nissan and Renault over several years.Earlier this month Mr Ghosn said the allegations were a plot and conspiracy against him, accusing Nissan executives of "backstabbing".
Samsung Galaxy Fold: Broken screens delay launch:::::Image caption The Samsung Galaxy Fold was supposed to be released on 26 April Samsung has postponed the release of its folding smartphone, days after several early reviewers said the screens on their devices had broken.The company said it had delayed the launch of the Galaxy Fold to "fully evaluate the feedback and run further internal tests".In April, several early reviewers found the display on the Galaxy Fold broke after just a few days.Samsung has not said when the 1,800 device will go on sale.A new launch date will be announced in the "coming weeks".In a statement, Samsung said it suspected the damage experienced by some of the reviewers was caused by "impact on the top and bottom exposed areas of the hinge".It also said it found "substances" inside one of the review devices that may have affected its performance.Launch events due to take place in Hong Kong and Shanghai this week have also been postponed.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption WATCH: Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Fold The Galaxy Fold was due to be released in the United States on 26 April, and in the UK on 3 May.The South Korean tech giant has said it is investigating what went wrong with the broken review units.In some cases, reviewers had peeled off a layer of the screen's coating, mistaking it for a disposable screen protector."We will also enhance the guidance on care and use of the display including the protective layer," Samsung said in a statement.Chinese rivals Huawei and Xiaomi are also developing foldable smartphones, but neither company has announced a release date yet.Analysis by Chris Fox, technology reporter A phone priced at 1,800 - or $1,980 in the US - was never supposed to be bought by the masses.But the launch of the Galaxy Fold was meant to showcase Samsung as an innovative and forward-thinking gadget maker, and draw people into its stores.Now it is turning into a bit of an embarrassment, evoking memories of another botched launch: the "exploding" Galaxy Note 7 smartphone.Samsung has been in a race to launch a folding device ahead of Chinese rival Huawei, which has announced its phone but not let reviewers take one home yet.Both manufacturers say their folding screens can be opened and closed more than 100,000 times without breaking, based on laboratory tests.But in the real world, reviewers have destroyed Samsung's device in less than 48 hours.Perhaps the Galaxy Fold needed a little longer in testing.
Lack of bank account 'costs £500 extra a year' in bills:::::Image copyright Getty Images People who do not have access to a bank account pay an extra 485 a year for everyday bills and services, research from an account provider suggests.More than 1.2 million Britons do not have a bank account, so miss out on discounts reserved for those who pay bills by direct debit, said Pockit.This ramps up the cost of energy bills, broadband and phone contracts, it said."For many of us, having a bank account is a basic fact of life," said Pockit boss Virraj Jatania."Yet the unbanked face a banking poverty premium which can put a real strain on their finances."UK Finance, which represents the UK banking industry, said banks took their financial inclusion responsibilities "extremely seriously"."The banking industry is committed to ensuring banking is accessible to all.There are over seven million basic bank accounts in the UK, helping customers across the country access vital banking services," it said.Traditional banks can reject customers applying for accounts if they do not have enough forms of ID, or if their credit rating is poor.But Pockit, which provides basic account services, said this meant many were being penalised.It analysed prices from leading service providers and found: Energy and broadband providers offer discounts to customers if they pay by direct debit - a saving which is not available to those without a bank account.Mobile phone companies offer better deals to those paying via direct debit rather than pay-as-you go customers.Those without accounts have limited options when looking for credit, and often turn to expensive cash-in-hand "doorstep loans".In one example, it found two of the UK's three largest broadband providers, BT and Virgin Media, offered a "super line rental discount" if you paid by direct debit.But customers without a current account had to pay using methods such as cash transfers, costing them 38 more a year on average.On electricity and gas, it analysed Ofgem data and found that those using pre-payment meters paid on average 141.57 more each year than those who paid by direct debit.
Tesla says investigating car explosion in Shanghai:::::Image copyright Getty Images Tesla said it is investigating a video on Chinese social media that appears to show one of its vehicles bursting into flames in Shanghai.In a statement, the carmaker said it had sent a team to investigate the matter, and that there were no reported casualties.The video, which has not been verified by the BBC, showed a stationary car erupting into flames in a parking lot.Tesla did not confirm the car model but social media identified it as Model S. "After learning about the incident in Shanghai, we immediately sent the team to the scene last night," according to a translation of a Tesla statement posted on Chinese social media platform Weibo."We are actively contacting relevant departments and supporting the verification.According to current information, there are no casualties."The video showed smoke rising from a parked, white vehicle and seconds later it bursts into flames.The time stamp on the video shows the incident happened on Sunday night, local time (Sunday morning GMT).Previous incidents involving Tesla vehicles catching on fire seem to have happened while the cars were moving.In 2018, a Tesla car driven by British TV director Michael Morris burst into flames, following another such incident involving a Model S model in France in 2016.A series of fires involving Tesla Model S cars took place in 2013.
Seventy-six pubs 'shutting per month', but closure rate slowing:::::Image copyright Getty Images Nearly 1,000 UK pubs shut last year, although the rate of closures is slowing, new research claims.About 76 pubs a month "vanished" from the communities they served in 2018, as people spent less on going out and pubs faced cost pressures, said property firm Altus Group.But this was down from 138 a month during the previous seven years.Alex Probyn, of Altus Group, said recent cuts to business rates had helped."The increase in the thresholds at which businesses, such as pubs, pay business rates coupled with the pubs discount during the last two financial years has helped ease the decline."According to the firm's research, the number of pubs slumped from more than 54,000 to 43,000 between 2010 and 2017.'Triple whammy' Industry group the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra) says more people are drinking at home to save money, while younger people are consuming less alcohol in general.And pubs have faced a "triple whammy" of taxes in the form of high Beer Duty, VAT and business rates."Pubs currently pay 2.8% of the business rates bill but only account for 0.5% of total business turnover, which is an overpayment of around 500m by the sector each year," it says on its website.High business rates are also viewed as contributing to the rising number of retail closures on Britain's high streets.But Altus said government changes to rates were starting to benefit the pubs industry, with the number liable to pay rates at all down by more than 1,500.It added that new rates relief, brought in on 1 April by the Chancellor, would help further."The new retail discount, which slashed rates bills by a third for high street firms with a rateable value less than 51,000, will help independent licensees in small premises," said Mr Probyn.
Thomas Cook reportedly receives bids for firm:::::Image copyright Getty Images Travel company Thomas Cook has received approaches for parts of its business and the company as a whole, according to reports.The business put its airline up for sale in February and it said last month it would close 21 stores across the country and cut more than 300 jobs.Chinese investment firm Fosun International could be a bidder for the company's tour operating business, Sky News reported.Thomas Cook declined to comment.Fosun International, which runs a joint venture with Thomas Cook in China, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Insiders told Sky it could be months before any formal offer is lodged, and there is no guarantee one will be made.Heatwave hit Thomas Cook is the world's oldest tour operator and was founded in Market Harborough in 1841 by businessman Thomas Cook.It started off with organised railway outings for members of the local temperance movement.It now has annual sales of 9bn, 19 million customers a year and 22,000 staff operating in 16 countries.In September, Thomas Cook said profits would be hit after the summer heatwave saw many take their holidays in the UK.It issued a second profit warning in November, when it said winter bookings were also down.The shop closures will take the number of Thomas Cook outlets down to 566.It said a consultation with staff and unions had begun.
Millions using 123456 as password, security study finds:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Liverpool FC topped the list of Premier League club names used as passwords Millions of people are using easy-to-guess passwords on sensitive accounts, suggests a study.The analysis by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) found 123456 was the most widely-used password on breached accounts.The study helped to uncover the gaps in cyber-knowledge that could leave people in danger of being exploited.The NCSC said people should string three random but memorable words together to use as a strong password.Sensitive data For its first cyber-survey, the NCSC analysed public databases of breached accounts to see which words, phrases and strings people used.Top of the list was 123456, appearing in more than 23 million passwords.The second-most popular string, 123456789, was not much harder to crack, while others in the top five included "qwerty", "password" and 1111111.The most common name to be used in passwords was Ashley, followed by Michael, Daniel, Jessica and Charlie.When it comes to Premier League football teams in guessable passwords, Liverpool are champions and Chelsea are second.Blink-182 topped the charts of music acts.People who use well-known words or names for a password put themselves people at risk of being hacked, said Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the NCSC."Nobody should protect sensitive data with something that can be guessed, like their first name, local football team or favourite band," he said.Hard to guess The NCSC study also quizzed people about their security habits and fears.It found that 42% expected to lose money to online fraud and only 15% said they felt confident that they knew enough to protect themselves online.It found that fewer than half of those questioned used a separate, hard-to-guess password for their main email account.Security expert Troy Hunt, who maintains a database of hacked account data, said picking a good password was the "single biggest control" people had over their online security."We typically haven't done a very good job of that either as individuals or as the organisations asking us to register with them," he said.Letting people know which passwords were widely used should drive users to make better choices, he said.The survey was published ahead of the NCSC's Cyber UK conference that will be held in Glasgow from 24-25 April.
HMRC: Beware of tax rebate text message scams:::::Image copyright Getty Images Earlier this month John, who believed he was due a tax refund, received a text message from "InfoHM"."I was bleary-eyed from waking up early," he says."The excitement of what my tax refund would be overwhelmed my normally pretty rational brain."He followed online instructions, and unwittingly provided personal and bank account details to online fraudsters.HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is now warning young adults to be wary of such phone scams.In April and May, the government body says, fraudsters target vulnerable people with fake messages to coincide with the time legitimate rebates are being processed.Because younger adults typically manage their finances via their mobile phones, they can be particularly susceptible to an approach via text message, HMRC warns.Last Spring, HMRC received 250,000 reports of such scams.John, who did not want the BBC to use his real name, says he is now "cringing" over falling for it.But he says the page he was directed to was "the spitting image" of a gov.uk site.After entering his national insurance number and date of birth, it informed him he was due a credible sounding rebate of 462.He ended up providing details including his bank details and even his mother's maiden name.Image copyright HMRC Image caption Example of a scam text, provided by HMRC "I didn't even think twice about giving out this information to this website," he says."They just have to catch you off guard.If I'd have got the text yesterday at 11:30am after a good night's sleep, I'd have been like: 'This is clearly a scam'."'I know I'm an idiot' John reported the breach to HMRC and Action Fraud, and has since put in place extra online security on his accounts."You don't need to tell me I'm an idiot," he says."I know I'm an idiot, this is one of the most idiotic things I've ever done."The HMRC says it never requests bank details by text or phone, and that it is shutting down hundreds of sites a week associated with these schemes, which are known as "phishing scams"."We are determined to protect honest people from these fraudsters who will stop at nothing to make their phishing scams appear legitimate," says head of customer services at HMRC, Angela MacDonald."If you receive one of these emails or texts, don't respond and report it to HMRC so that more online criminals are stopped in their tracks."Scammers also use phone calls, voicemails and emails, which may contain computer viruses designed to copy personal or financial information.

Does your dinner come from a “dark kitchen”?:::::Image caption Deliveroo's "dark kitchens" are workspaces allowing restaurants to meet demand for app deliveries Your next meal might come from this windswept industrial estate on the banks of the River Irwell.Outside, a handful of drivers wait in their cars.Mopeds and bicycles are stacked in a small pile.All are poised to collect freshly prepared, restaurant quality meals and take them to hungry consumers at home.But this is not a restaurant.It's a so-called "dark kitchen".Deliveroo Editions are a cluster of small professional workspaces that allow established eateries to service our insatiable appetite for app delivery without over-stretching existing sites."The whole idea is to help restaurants expand into new areas without necessarily having the same cost-base they would have in expanding on the high street," explains Dan Warne, managing director of Deliveroo UK."In 90% of cases, your dinner is going to come from a high street restaurant.And it will be very clear."Image caption "Dark kitchens" are the future of the takeaway sector, says Deliveroo's Dan Warne Customers can spot if their meal comes from these sites via a purple Editions logo online.There are now 16 sites across England housing about a hundred stainless-steel kitchens.Some have pizza ovens, others fast-flip burgers.The different restaurant brands have their own staff and cookers, but they share shelves and facilities.Like a student house, the fridge is littered with Post-Its on ingredients.But most crucially, it's Deliveroo paying the bills; no rent, no rates, no utilities.All restaurants chip in is commission on each order, but it's unclear how much.Deliveroo would not give the BBC a figure, explaining it varies from business to business.But Mr. Warne dismisses claims that the kitchens take business away from High Streets and gives more power to the app."We've helped the industry over the last five years by bringing a dine-in experience to a customer at home.Incrementally that's adding 30% on top of the sales that these restaurants are already achieving."Image caption The UK takeaway industry is now worth almost 5bn Apps now account for 39% of delivery visits - a rise of 14% year-on-year - and the takeaway industry has grown and grown to be worth a tasty 4.9bn - according to consumer research firm NPD.Dark kitchens make huge sense for the burger brand Boo.Set up by Arif Palejwala and his brother-in-law in Leicester, they have reached three other cities without having to find premises nor fork out."We're basically testing the waters.We started off in Nottingham and performed really well," he explains."Then they offered us a Manchester site, we're going to be going to Leeds and probably some of the places down South as well.So hopefully in the next 12 months we'll have six to eight kitchens."Image caption Boo's Arif Palejwala says the dark kitchen allows him to test markets without having to invest in a kitchen Likewise, luxury sushi business Zumu is using the space to reach a city-centre delivery market."We are new," says co-owner Oliver Ibanez."We can cater for people here in the centre of Manchester without buying equipment or renting; we just come here and do our cooking."The company is also trialling a spin-off Filipino chicken brand to their new click-ready clientele; and it's flying.But others are not convinced.In Manchester city centre, vegetarian street-food joint Bundobust is buzzing - and poised to open a third site of its stunning, retro-style Indian restaurants in Liverpool in just a few weeks.The brand is thriving.Without any apps.Image caption Marko Husak doesn't see app deliveries as threat to his restaurants "When the customer eats our food, I want it to be as perfect as it can be," says co-founder Marko Husak."If it goes on a moped for fifteen minutes, it might be cold, it might be soggy, it might have spilled.It's always better to go to a restaurant than have it delivered to your door."Mr Husak does not view the apps as a threat, but does want consumers to value the dining in experience.There is also growing disquiet about planning and regulation of the Editions sites.Of the 16 locations three have been served with enforcement notices by the local council that are currently going through an appeal process.Two more have only been granted temporary permission to operate.A former site in Camberwell was served notice to cease operating.The first wave of kitchens began in 2017 in London from portable buildings.Newer sites outside the capital are in permanent constructions.But none are registered as a restaurant or takeaway, avoiding complex planning permissions.All kitchens are subject to Food Standards Agency checks.Deliveroo Editions locations Image copyright Getty Images London: Battersea (York Road, Queens Road & Culvert Place), Bermondsey, Blackwall, Dulwich, Hornsey, Islington, Swiss Cottage, Whitechapel Cambridge Hove Nottingham Leeds Reading Salford The company is operating in a new grey area.And the Editions model is still a small part of Deliveroo's business - only a hundred kitchens versus about 20,000 partner restaurants - but the tech firm is investing heavily and expanding."It's a way that the industry can help itself evolve and move into the future," says Mr Warne.With over 1,200 restaurant insolvencies hitting big-name chains and independents in 2018, there is no denying there's a shake-up in how we want to get our food.And Deliveroo is determined to a take a big bite of that.
Could a computer ever rival Rembrandt or Beethoven?:::::Image copyright Christie's Image caption This portrait was created by computer, so is it really art and is it any good?Last year a portrait of Edmond Belamy sold for $432,000 (337,000).A bit steep, you might think, for a picture of someone you've never heard of.And you won't have heard of the artist either, as the picture was created by an algorithm drawing on a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th Centuries.And to be honest, it's a bit rubbish.The sale, which astonished auction house Christie's, raised many important questions.Can a computer, devoid of human emotion, ever be truly creative?Is this portrait really art?Does any of that matter if people are prepared to pay for it?And as artificial intelligence evolves and eventually perhaps reaches or surpasses human level intelligence, what will this mean for human artists and the creative industries in general?Algorithms have already created artworks, poems, and pieces of music, but are they merely mimicking rather than creating?Cognitive neuroscientist Romy Lorenz says a lot depends on how we define creativity.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Chinese Go player Ke Jie was eventually defeated by DeepMind's AlphaGo AI program If creativity means finding completely new ways to solve problems, then AI has already achieved that, she argues, citing Google's DeepMind subsidiary.In 2017, one of DeepMind's AI programmes beat the world's number one player of Go, an ancient and highly complex Chinese board game, after apparently mastering creative new moves and innovative strategies within days."Google would say that was creativity - new ways of finding solutions that it was not taught," she says.But is art more than just creative problem-solving?More Technology of Business Games, particularly those which take place within virtual worlds, have been the perfect setting for AI to solve problems creatively.But asking an algorithm to create without any human input at all actually yields quite boring results, argues New York-based professor of computer science, Julian Togelius.He cites Kate Compton's "10,000 bowls of oatmeal" problem, which suggests that while algorithms can now create infinite worlds, these can be tedious for humans to play in.An example, he suggests, was the hotly-anticipated release of space exploration game No Man's Sky, which offered 18 quintillion algorithmically-generated planets to explore.Image copyright Hello Games Image caption No Man's Sky uses "procedural generation" to create new worlds automatically "In No Man's Sky there are more places you could visit in a lifetime, with different flora and fauna.But that game has had mixed reviews - it's a technical masterpiece but it's not super interesting to play," he says."The question is, can your algorithm generate a world that has meaning to it, and that is particular to the player in terms of place or skill?"These algorithms are amazing - they can do more and more.But there will always be things us humans want to put in.It's the power of the sensibility and intentionality of the human brain - that's what is hard [to recreate]."Dr Lorenz points out that true artistic creativity differs from creative problem solving in that it requires a shift in perspective that machines do not appear to have the capacity for.Image copyright Romy Lorenz Image caption Romy Lorenz says AI has no "internal world" from which to create true art "Artistic creativity is about turning an introspective thought into a medium, whether it's a sculpture or a piece of music.It's about taking an abstract form and making it concrete."But AI has no internal world and it has no need to create its desires or fears."So rather than letting AI take complete control, results seem to be far more fruitful when human artists work hand-in-hand with machines.Musician and University of Sussex lecturer Dr Alice Eldridge suggests that we should treat AI as "just another tool that we have designed, like the wheel, or the combustion engine".Image copyright Dr Alice Eldridge Image caption Dr Alice Eldridge (l) and Dr Chris Kiefer (r) play their self-resonating feedback cellos She has helped create a cello that uses a combination of acoustics, electrification and an adaptive algorithm that makes the instrument self-resonate; or essentially, play itself."With a classical cello you have to bring the instrument alive with a bow; a feedback cello is already singing, your job as a performer is to shape the sound - it's more like a dance than 'controlling' an instrument in the traditional way," she says."This creates a different way of thinking about, and designing our relationships with, musical instruments, and technology in general."Mick Grierson, at the UAL Creative Computing Institute in London, believes advances in AI will "lead to better art, new types of artists and new mediums".In 2016, Nordic band Sigur Rs used his software to create a constantly evolving version of one of their singles, which the band played on a 24-hour road trip around Iceland.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The band Massive Attack have been experimenting with AI to create unique pieces of art Individual musical elements of the song were fed through the software to make a song that, like a live performance, is subtly different with every repetition, and could respond to external prompts.Innovative composer and producer Brian Eno, who has worked with Roxy Music, David Bowie and Coldplay amongst others, is also a big fan of using algorithms to create music that constantly changes.Prof Grierson has also worked with Massive Attack on an AI reworking of their Mezzanine album, to mark its 20th anniversary.The album will be fed into a form of AI that teaches itself - a neural network - and visitors to an upcoming Barbican exhibition will be able to affect the resulting sound by their movements.While AI could be seen as yet another threat to artists' livelihoods, he believes machines will never come close to competing."AI could be used to reduce human creativity by people who want to make money - but it's people [not technology] who are responsible for doing that."The technology is never going to be good enough to generate better culture than people who use it to create their own."Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebooko
Why the US-China rivalry will not end with a trade deal:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The two presidents preside over markedly different national economic models A US-China trade deal - if it happens - is unlikely to end the rivalry between the two economic giants.Both sides have fought a trade war over the past year with damaging consequences for the global economy.But many say their dispute goes well beyond trade - it represents a power-struggle between two very different world views.Deal or no deal, that rivalry is only expected to broaden and become more difficult to resolve."We have entered into a new normal in which US-China geopolitical competition has intensified and become more explicit," says Michael Hirson, Asia director at consultancy firm Eurasia Group."The trade deal will moderate one phase of the US-China power struggle, but only temporarily and with limited effect."The US-China rivalry is likely to play out next in the crucial technology sector, analysts say, as both sides try to establish themselves as the world's technology leader.Issues around technology transfer have been key during trade talks between the world's two largest economies in recent months."Every country now correctly recognises that their prosperity, their wealth, their economic security, their military security is going to be linked to keeping a technological edge," says Stephen Olson, research fellow at global trade advisory body Hinrich Foundation.The technology battle Many say the US-China technology battle is already under way - and China's tech giant Huawei is at its very centre.Huawei has been the focus of intense international scrutiny lately, with the US and other countries raising security concerns about its products.The US has restricted federal agencies from using Huawei products and has encouraged allies to shun them.Australia and New Zealand have both blocked the use of Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The US government has accused Huawei of being a spying risk, something it strongly denies But Huawei has said it is independent from the Chinese government.Its founder Ren Zhengfei told the BBC in February that his company would never undertake any spying activities.The dispute reached fever pitch with the arrest of the founder's daughter in December, and more recently Huawei's lawsuit against the US government.Huawei has also gone on a public relations offensive, placing a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal telling Americans not to "believe everything you hear"."The term 'cold war' is overused in the context of overall US-China tensions, but is increasingly accurate in describing their technology competition," says Mr Hirson.The dispute over Huawei is "symptomatic of this intensified geopolitical competition," he adds."This rivalry is far more difficult to resolve than pure trade issues."How did we get here?US concerns about China have grown in recent years, along with China's influence around the world.Its massive Belt and Road Initiative, the Made in China 2025 plans, and the growing importance of companies like Huawei and Alibaba have all contributed to those fears.US Vice President Mike Pence summed up the mood in a speech in October, saying China had chosen "economic aggression", rather than "greater partnership" as it opened its economy.Hopes China would embrace a more Western model has given way to a recognition that China's economy has boomed alongside a state-run system, not in spite of it."China has become much more explicit in its ambitions in the last few years," says Andrew Gilholm, director of analysis for China, at consultancy Control Risks."Therefore nobody is imagining that China is going to follow a Western liberal democratic model, or converge towards a market economy in the way that people hoped a few years ago."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China's exports have boomed over the past two decades Some analysts think a stand-off between the two sides was inevitable.Their different systems have always made them awkward bedfellows in the global economy, while clashes between existing and rising powers are common in history."What we are dealing with here is friction between traditional free market economics, free trade economics, Washington consensus principles versus - for the first time - a huge, technologically sophisticated, centrally-managed economy that is playing the game by a different set of rules," says Mr Olson.What happens now?As the technology race gathers pace, analysts expect the US to continue to use non-tariff measures to push back against China.Restrictions on Chinese investment into the US, limits on the ability of US firms to export technology to China, and further pressure on Chinese companies are all tools that could be used, they say."Non-tariff measures don't get the attention from markets that tariffs do, partly because their impact is harder to quantify, but they can have far-reaching impact," says Mr Hirson.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: A new US law passed last year could facilitate this push-back.It strengthened the government's power to review - and potentially block - business deals involving foreign firms by expanding the type of deals that can be reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS).The committee vets foreign investments to see if they pose a risk to national security.Last year, even before the new law passed, a high-profile deal involving the sale of US-based money transfer firm MoneyGram to Alibaba's digital payments arm Ant Financial collapsed when the companies did not get the required approval from CFIUS.New US-China norm?How US-China relations develop from here will partly depend on the kind of trade deal they strike.Burdened by tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have shown a willingness to talk since agreeing on a truce in December.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption President Trump has been talked tough against China over the trade issue But analysts say the relationship between the two giants could look different going forward irrespective of any trade deal.They could have "an entirely cooperative, flourishing, mutually beneficial relationship" in certain areas but put up barriers in others in what Mr Olson described as a "selective decoupling".An increasing number of areas could be fenced off, particularly those related to technology, he says."Is Huawei ever going to, in a significant way, be able to participate in the construction of the 5G network in the United States?It seems unlikely."
Will AI kill developing world growth?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Could AI mean fewer opportunities for work in Africa?Artificial intelligence (AI) could displace millions of jobs in the future, damaging growth in developing regions such as Africa, says Ian Goldin, professor of globalisation and development at Oxford University.I have spent my career in international development, and in recent years have established a research group at Oxford University looking at the impact of disruptive technologies on developing economies.Perhaps the most important question we have looked at is whether AI will pose a threat - or provide new opportunities - for developing regions such as Africa.Optimists say that such places could use rapidly advancing AI systems to boost productivity and leapfrog ahead.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Automated systems are already getting higher customer satisfaction ratings than people in call centres But I am becoming increasingly concerned that AI will, in fact, block the traditional growth path by replacing low-wage jobs with robots.As Kai-Fu Lee, a Beijing-based venture capitalist who invests in artificial intelligence, tells us, AI is potentially the most revolutionary technology to emerge this century.It is also, along with the associated technologies of machine learning and robotics, advancing at breakneck speed.Already AI has the capacity to replace many work tasks that are rules-based and repetitive, and which do not require great dexterity or empathy.In developed economies, for instance, robots have replaced well over half of the jobs in the car and related industries in recent decades.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many jobs in the car industry have been displaced by robots Automated systems are already getting higher customer satisfaction ratings than people in call centres, threatening a key source of jobs in many countries.Similarly, AI enabled systems are leading to significant job losses in back-office administrative functions in banking, health, insurance and accounting.These are roles that had in recent years been outsourced to developing countries such as India, Vietnam, South Africa and Morocco.Jobs at risk?According to our research at Oxford, about 40% of jobs in Europe are vulnerable to AI over the coming decades, almost half of jobs in the USA, and an even greater share in developing countries.Some argue that AI will create as many new jobs as those lost to robots, and that we shouldn't worry too much.But I believe that those new jobs will be concentrated in certain parts of the developed world, and that the developing world will miss out.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: This matters most acutely in poorer nations that have used their relatively low-cost labour force as a first stage in catching up with the developed economies, examples being China, Thailand and Vietnam.Most of the jobs at threat in such places would be of the semi-skilled variety.But the fact that poor countries also tend to suffer shortages of highly skilled labour could further undermine their competitiveness.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Incomes have soared in tech hubs like San Francisco The development of supplementary technologies will add to the challenge.3D printing, will combine with AI to allow consumers in rich countries to manufacture individually customised clothes, shoes, devices and other products, by themselves, much closer to home.The rise of such production could mean that the age of outsourcing production to developing countries is drawing to a close.Guy Ryder, director general of the UN's International Labour Organisation, highlights how the politics of protectionism will accelerate this.The demand to repatriate manufacturing to advanced countries has never been higher, although it is not jobs but AI and robotic processes that are coming home.Growing inequality As technology plays an increasingly dominant role in the global economy, the parts of the planet driving technological development stand to gain even more power.Just look at the concentration of wealth and incomes we have seen in places such as Silicon Valley.This trend could be replicated globally, worsening inequality.Due to the difficult to measure and cross-border nature of the digital economy, government tax revenues have been undermined, reducing investment in infrastructure, health and education.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A handful of big companies have come to dominate the tech industry The tech industry also sucks up talent from around the globe, leaving shortages of human capital in some countries.All economies now require highly skilled workers to work in areas like AI, but these globetrotting individuals tend to prefer living in safe and developed cities that offer the best career opportunities.With some notable exceptions - such as Bangalore in India - poorer countries will find it harder to attract and retain such workers, leaving them even more vulnerable.This concentration effect is not just evident in terms of location, but among companies themselves too.For example, just a handful of firms, based mainly in the US and China, now dominate AI, meaning that even European and Japanese businesses struggle to compete.A silver lining?Is all lost?Perhaps not.New firms are emerging that aim to use AI to boost growth and productivity in developing economies.They are also allowing citizens to access education, health, employment and other opportunities.One such company is M-Pesa, a mobile phone-based money transfer service, whose platform is used by more than 60% of Kenyans.M-Tiba, another Kenyan app, uses similar technology to deliver health services to more than four million people.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Money transfer app M-Pesa is used by more than 60% of Kenyans Some experts believe that AI could yield the same disruptive benefits as mobile phone technology in the developing world, helping to overcome the absence of infrastructure that contributes to low incomes and stalled development.Recent reports from the Pathways for Prosperity Commission and the World Bank similarly argue that AI and the digital economy could provide education, as well as jobs and incomes for people in poor countries, including those in isolated rural areas.However, it's early days for many of these companies, and it's not yet clear if they will succeed.It's also unclear whether the positive experiences in a handful of countries such as Kenya can be replicated elsewhere, and whether the positives outweigh the threats, not least in terms of lost jobs, tax revenues and rising inequality.The clock is ticking and the risks posed by AI to development have never been higher.Policymakers everywhere should be listening carefully and thinking hard about how to respond.Ian Goldin is professor of globalisation and development at Oxford University.His BBC World Service documentary, Will AI Kill Development, is available on the BBC iPlayer.
What do drones and GPS owe to a 1744 shipwreck?:::::Image copyright Alamy On 5 October 1744, a storm was brewing in the English Channel.With sails set for home after chasing a French fleet off the coast of Portugal, a squadron of British warships was in trouble.The lead ship HMS Victory sank 100m to the seabed 50 miles (80km) south of Plymouth, taking with it 1,100 men and - so rumour had it - lots of Portuguese gold.The wreckage lay undisturbed until it was located by a marine salvage company in 2009.Beyond the rumoured gold, there was something else on board which was arguably much more economically significant.Also lost that day was the first known attempt to develop an idea that is now used to guide everything from submarines to satellites, from rovers on Mars to the phone in your pocket.When the Victory went down, it took with it John Serson's "whirling speculum", forerunner to the gyroscope.Find out more: 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.Serson was a sea captain, and barely literate.But he was also an "ingenious mechanick", as The Gentleman's Magazine later put it.He was trying to solve a serious problem.Sailors worked out a ship's position by using a quadrant to take an angle from the sun to the horizon, but you could not always see the horizon, because of haze or mist.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quadrants have been used for marine navigation since the 15th Century Inspired by a child's spinning top toy, Serson wondered if he could create an artificial horizon - something that would stay level, even as a ship lurched and swayed around it.As The Gentleman's Magazine recounts, he "got a kind of top made, whose upper surface perpendicular to the axe was a circular plane of polish'd metal; and found, as he had expected, that when this top was briskly set in motion, its plane surface would soon become horizontal.If the whirling plane were disturbed from its horizontal position, it would soon recover it again".After impressing two high-ranking naval officers and an eminent mathematician, Serson was asked to make further observations aboard the HMS Victory: "and so perish'd poor Mr Serson".His widow, Sarah Serson, was left penniless and asked the Navy for copies of his documents so she could try to make money from the speculum, although there seems to be no evidence that she succeeded.However, a century later, French physicist Leon Foucault would produce a successful prototype based on the same principle which had fascinated Serson.Image copyright Getty Images Foucault called his device a "gyroscope", from the Greek words for "turn" and "observe", because he used it to study the Earth's rotation.It was a spinning disc mounted in gimbals, a set of pivoted supports that allow the disc to maintain its orientation regardless of how the base might be tilting around.Then electric motors came along, meaning the disc could spin indefinitely.And practical applications came thick and fast.Ships got workable artificial horizons and so did aeroplanes.In the early 1900s, two inventors figured out how to align the spin to the Earth's north-south axis, giving us the gyrocompass.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The gyrocompass was widely hailed as a modern wonder, shown here on a cigarette card.Combine these instruments with others - accelerometers, magnetometers - and you get a good idea of which way up you are and in which direction you are heading.Feed these outputs into systems that can course-correct, and you have an aeroplane's autopilot, a ship's gyro-stabilizer, and navigation systems on spacecraft or missiles.Add in GPS, and you know where you are.There is a limit to how small you can make spinning discs in gimbals, but other technological developments have miniaturised the gyroscope.Vibrating micro-electro-mechanical gyroscopes measure only a few cubic millimetres.Researchers are making a laser-based gyroscope thinner than a human hair.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The first GPS watch was produced by Casio 20 years ago in 1999 As these and other sensors have got smaller and cheaper - and computers faster, and batteries lighter - they have found uses from smartphones to robots, gaming consoles and virtual reality headsets.And another technology around which there is a particular buzz: the drone.The first pilotless flight is often traced to 1849 - only three years before Foucault's gyroscope.Austria tried to attack Venice by fixing bombs to balloons and waiting for the wind to blow in the right direction.It was not a triumph: some bombs landed in Austrian territory.But military uses continued to drive drone technology.If you searched for "drones" in a news archive, until about four or five years ago, you would find that the top stories were about war.Then suddenly they started being about "what do airspace regulations mean for hobbyists?", and "how long before drones are delivering our groceries?".More things that made the modern economy: That is a big question.Drones are now commonplace from surveying to moviemaking; they get urgent medical supplies to hard-to-reach places.But it is the routine, everyday uses that promise to be truly transformative: flying our online shopping to us, or even flying us - the Chinese company Ehang is pioneering drones that can carry human passengers.In rural China, delivery drones are starting to look like a leapfrog technology: one that catches on most quickly where there is not a competing established infrastructure - in this case, of big-box retail stores and roads for van deliveries.Zhangwei, for example, is a village in Jiangsu province where few people own cars, and only half have fridges, but everyone has a phone - and they use those mobiles to place orders at online retailer JD.com for everything from disposable nappies to fresh crabs.Image copyright JD.com Image caption JD.com has been using drones like this one shown landing in Jiangsu Province since 2016 As Jiayang Fan describes in the New Yorker, about four times a day, warehouse workers dispatch the village's orders on a drone that carries up to 30lb at 45 miles per hour.Everyone is happy - except for Big Auntie, the woman who runs the village shop.If drones are to take off more widely, we will need better solutions to the so-called "last mile" problem.In Zhangwei, JD.com employs a human to distribute the crabs and the nappies to the villagers who ordered them - but in countries where labour is pricier, the last miles are where delivery costs are concentrated; automate it, and some believe bricks-and-mortar stores could cease to exist altogether.But nobody is sure precisely how that might work.Image copyright Amazon Image caption Amazon and Google are both trialling large-scale drone delivery services Do we want our online purchases parachuted into our back gardens, or plunked on the roofs of our apartment buildings?How about smart windows that can open to let in drones when we are not at home?Are more stringent no-fly zones needed to avoid the kind of disruption recently caused at Gatwick and Heathrow when drone sightings delayed hundreds of flights?Then there is another problem - the one that did for poor John Serson: the weather.If we are going to rely on airborne deliveries, they will have to work in all conditions.Will drones ever navigate storms that could sink a battleship?Perhaps then the promise of the gyroscope will have truly been fulfilled.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
How can you stop your kids viewing harmful web content?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Is education and negotiation more effective than technology at policing your kids' digital usage?As concerns grow about the effect of harmful social media content on our children, we look at what tools are available for parents to regulate what kids see and how long they spend online.The struggle to prise them away from a life spent online is a familiar one for many beleaguered parents.Our youngsters spend hours on Instagram chasing "likes" - and often coming up against cyber-bullying - or playing games, obsessing about YouTube influencers or surfing between different "friendship groups" on WhatsApp.So how can we keep them safe from harmful content?Content filtering software has been around for many years, but parents have often been too tech-shy to work it properly.And it often required children to hand over their passwords - a potential cause of family rows.But now a new generation of digital parental controls has arrived on the market, promising to help parents take back control more easily.Circle with Disney, Koala Safe and Ikydz, for example, are systems that claim to be able to control every digital device in your home with a few taps on a smartphone app.Image copyright Circle with Disney Image caption Circle with Disney's cube is designed to be easy to use, but is it really necessary?The new products work by connecting to your existing household wi-fi router.In the case of Circle you plug in the white cube - clearly inspired by the Apple school of design - and it immediately lists every connected phone, laptop, tablet, and so on in your home, and offers a variety of ways to control them.It can be tricky to work out who owns which device.Initially I block my husband's phone by mistake - to howls of outrage.But once I identify each device's MAC address - a set of numbers and letters unique to each product - it is relatively easy to assign each gadget to a specific user.Then you can set filters based on age - pre-school, kid, teen, adult or none - which block explicit content, gambling, dating and more, according to the filter selected.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ian Russell partly blames Instagram for his daughter taking her own life and says "the urgency is huge" to protect children online You can also block specific apps or websites - Fortnite and Instagram anyone?And you can put time limits on usage, pause the internet, and set bed times.But you could do most of this with traditional filtering software, and these days internet service providers, cyber-security software firms and web browsers are all much better at offering family settings on their services.What's more, the same issues arise.My two daughters, aged 11 and 13, loudly protest about "violations of privacy" when they realised I could see every site and app they've visited.Once I've reassured them that this is not about snooping, but more about limitation and safety, they grudgingly seem to accept the new controls.Indeed, a 2018 survey of young people between the ages of 11 and 16 by Internet Matters, an online safety not-for-profit organisation, showed that 65% were in favour of parental controls.Image copyright Phil Coomes Image caption Laurel and and her daughters.Content filtering tech is useful, but so is education and discussion when it comes to the web Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, thinks it is good parenting to set limits."The internet can be a great resource, but it can also be the wild west for children.We wouldn't think it was OK to drop our children off in the park at night if they were younger," she says."In the same way we shouldn't think it is OK for them to roam the internet without any guidance or restrictions."There are disadvantages with these latest filtering devices, though.Some don't work once your child's phone leaves the home and is no longer on home wi-fi.And they won't all work if the wi-fi is switched off and the internet is accessed via mobile data.Other products are also incompatible with some UK routers.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nicole and Tali became friends through Instagram So what other options are there?More Technology of Business "For younger children a Monqi phone [Monqi make phones designed specifically for kids] might be a better option as a first device," advises Ghislaine Bombusa, head of digital at Internet Matters."Or if you're worried about particular websites you can set safe search on your family's broadband; that may be sufficient and is free.You can also set up Google Safe Search or restricted mode on YouTube."Another option is buying one of the new generation of high-speed routers, some of which not only deliver good coverage but also have parental control options pre-installed.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Do you know what your kids are looking at online?And for parents with more tech expertise, Kate Bevan, editor of Which?Computing, recommends setting up Open DNS up on your router, which enables parents to put controls in place.The basic blocking options are free.But Ben Halpert, who set up the US based Savvy Cyber Kids, warns that there are limits to what technology alone can achieve."Once children reach a certain age, their peers will tell them, or they will stumble upon ways to get around parental controls," he says."No matter what technology you put in place, it will never prevent your child from being exposed to things you wish they did not experience.This is why building trust with your children and continuing to talk about technology use is so important."Most experts stress that discussion, education and negotiation are just as important as technical fixes when it comes to keeping your kids safe online.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
'We made more than five billion teabags last year':::::Image copyright Bettys and Taylors Group Image caption Lesley Wild has been chair of Bettys & Taylors of Harrogate since 2011 The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to Lesley Wild, chair of Bettys & Taylors of Harrogate, the parent group behind Yorkshire Tea.Visit a British household and it's quite likely you'll find a box of Yorkshire Tea in the kitchen cupboard.After all, the tea brand is the nation's second favourite after PG Tips, with more than 5.5 billion teabags produced in 2018.Last year its growing tea sales were given a boost by some top Yorkshire celebrities - and self-professed fans of the brand - who appeared in its latest advertising campaign.They included Sir Michael Parkinson, indie band the Kaiser Chiefs and Olympic-medal winning triathletes the Brownlee brothers.Image copyright Bettys and Taylors Group Image caption Yorkshire Tea makes billions of teabags every year So why is Yorkshire Tea so well loved?"Because it tastes so good," says Lesley Wild, chair of Bettys & Taylors of Harrogate, the family business behind the brand."We have a hugely dedicated team who taste thousands of teas every day to ensure that we always have the best quality.Our blends also take into consideration the type of water that will be used to brew them at home."Yorkshire Tea is arguably the group's best known product, but it also owns the coffee and tea merchant Taylors of Harrogate and the high-end cafe chain Bettys.Yorkshire Tea is also a relatively new part of the firm, having been launched in 1970, and the group's origins actually date back as far as 1919 when the first Bettys teashop opened in Harrogate, Yorkshire.Image copyright Bettys and Taylors Group Image caption Frederick Belmont opened the first Bettys tearoom in 1919 It was set up by Swiss migr Frederick Belmont, who came to England to further his career having honed his craft at bakeries and confectioners across Switzerland and France.Legend has it he only ended up in Yorkshire by accident, says Mrs Wild, whose husband Jonathan is Mr Belmont's great nephew and Bettys & Taylors' former boss."On his arrival in London Frederick realised he'd lost the address of his destination, and all he could remember was that the place he was heading for sounded like 'bratwurst' (a type of German sausage).So a passer-by put him on the train to Bradford!"Image copyright Bettys and Taylors Group Image caption Bettys has six tearooms, all of which offer a silver service Bettys, which specialised in high quality cakes with a silver service, quickly became a hit and has since opened five more traditionally-themed tearooms, all in Yorkshire.It also runs its own cookery school and online gifts shop.The business got further into tea in 1962 when it bought Taylors of Harrogate - a tea and coffee merchant whose products are today sold in supermarkets across the UK and overseas.Mrs Wild started working part-time at her husband's family business in the late 1960s, while training to be a solicitor, and joined full time in 1979.Image copyright Bettys and Taylors Group Image caption Bettys also specialises in high quality cakes "It was my ideal job really," she says, "and my legal skills turned out to be quite useful."Her first official role was as export manager, with one of her earliest tasks being to develop a range of fruit cakes to sell overseas."Because I loved baking and cooking, I developed the recipes and I designed the tins.Then I had to go and sell them abroad."In 1996 Jonathan Wild became chief executive and chair of Bettys & Taylors of Harrogate, taking the reins from his father Victor.Jonathan's first move was to streamline the business which he felt had become too diverse."We were doing outside catering, baking, making frozen desserts for supermarkets... We were too fragmented and needed to get back to our core," says Mrs Wild.Mr Wild also decided to revamp Bettys' cafes, which by that point had abandoned their traditional decor for a more modern look-and-feel.More The Boss features: "They had lost that sense of somewhere really special," says Ms Wild."So we started to bring back the silver teapots and cake stands - things that people see in Bettys today and think have always been around."Mr Wild remained boss until 2011 when he retired and the company has since made further changes, restructuring its board to ensure that no one person has absolute power."When Jonathan was heading up the business, he was the major shareholder and a family member and he called the shots," explains Mrs Wild, who became chair in 2011."Really people were just waiting for Jonathan to make decisions which was alright at the time.But once he decided to step down I, and others, thought, 'We're going to need a culture change'."Image copyright Bettys and Taylors Group Image caption The group's joint chief executives: Paul Cogan, Simon Eyles, Rachel Fellows and Andy Brown Unusually, chief executive responsibilities are now shared equally between four directors, although the business is still owned by the Wild family.Sales at the Harrogate-based group, which employs 1,400 staff, continue to grow.In its most recent accounts for 2017 it posted revenues of 189.7m - up from 173.6m the year before - while pre-tax profits jumped from 9.3m to 16m.Despite its enviable performance, Mrs Wild says the firm is not immune from the challenges affecting UK retailers.Consumers have been spending less on the High Street and doing more of their shopping online, leading to a rash of retailers going bust or announcing closures."There's not as many people wandering around on the High Street, but then in our favour people are still looking for experiences.So as long as they do come out, we can provide an experience different to everyone else's."Image copyright Bettys and Taylors Group Image caption Will young people turn away from black tea in the future?The group's flagship brand, Yorkshire Tea, is also doing well but it could face risks."The brand's heavy and consistent investment in its advertising is clearly bearing fruit," says Amy Price, a senior food and drink analyst at Mintel."But like its fellow black tea brands, the challenge for the future will be in engaging a younger demographic, which is less likely than average to drink black tea and more likely than average to drink green, fruit or speciality tea."Looking ahead, Mrs Wild says Bettys & Taylors of Harrogate will keep focusing on what it does best and only branch out if it really makes sense.However, it has put some new, Swiss-themed items on the Bettys' menu this year to celebrate its centenary and there will be an anniversary bash for staff."We're already planning for the next 100 years," Mrs Wild says."Frederick will be sitting having a cigar and looking down at us quite fondly, thinking we've done okay."
Why a timely nudge might help us save money:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The experiment in rural India has inspired a range of products Anyone struggling to save money might take inspiration from labourers in rural India.These low-paid construction workers took part in an experiment.When they were paid, some of the cash was put into one envelope, or two, and earmarked as savings.The stakes were raised for some when a picture of their children was attached to one of the envelopes.Dipping into those savings for everyday spending - by ripping through the image of their sons and daughters - made them feel guilty.So, as they tried to avoid this guilty feeling, the amount they saved increased.Can't save, won't save This is more than just a theory.In the UK today, millions of people set money aside in a separate savings account to stop them spending it day-to-day.Financial technology companies such as Wagestream, which allows workers to extract pay and save directly from their wages before payday, are trying out the use of reward and guilt.It allows users to load an image of their savings goal onto the app, such as a car or a holiday destination.The more they save, the clearer the image becomes.If they withdraw money, the picture starts to disappear."It subtly reinforces the reality of what they are doing and can materially influence their behaviour," says Peter Briffett, co-founder of Wagestream.The reality, and the concern for many, is that the UK has lost its savings habit.This graph shows that experts are not expecting it to return any time soon.The proportion of income left after taxes that we save is known as the savings ratio.For the last couple of years, the UK has saved about 4% of disposable income.In the 1990s, it came close to 15%.The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which makes forecasts for the government, predicts it will stay at or around this 50-year low for the next five years at least.It is not all bad.The OBR, the Bank of England, and others expect interest rates to stay low too.Many people are deciding to pay off debts when the costs are low, rather than save when the rewards (in interest payments) are low too.However, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says the increase in consumers' spending has outstripped any income growth in the last couple of years.A lack of savings has real consequences for the lives of millions of people - particularly the young and low-paid.No savings means no financial buffer for the unexpected - no way to pay when a deposit is needed to rent a home, or when the vet's bill lands after the cat is ill. or when the car breaks down.No car may mean no job.Data shows the extent of the problem: Official statistics reveal half of 20-somethings have no savings at all Research by the Financial Conduct Authority found one in six people could not cope with a 50 rise in monthly rent or mortgage costs In 2016, the Money Advice Service found that 16 million people in the UK had savings of less than 100 In Northern Ireland, the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humber, North East England and Wales, more than half of the adult population had no more than 100 tucked away Free money offered by the government has done little to reverse the situation.The Help to Save scheme offers a 50% bonus to certain people on low incomes if they save for two or four years.Take-up has been below half the level expected by the OBR.So MAS, now called the Money and Pensions Service, wanted to find new ways to encourage people to save.It turned to the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT), commonly known as the "nudge unit".Image copyright Getty Images In a tiny meeting room, one wall of which is entirely a whiteboard, sits someone with big ideas.Elisabeth Costa, is a director at BIT and leads a team of five trialling various projects aimed at encouraging those who are in work, but financially squeezed, to save.A total of 244 ideas about savings, guidance, and managing debts were thought up, before 17 were chosen for trials.In the end, many boil down to this: using timely reminders and automatic technology can help people manage their finances.We "underestimate behavioural factors", she says, which can be as powerful a motivator as, for example, an increase in the interest paid on savings."The industry should make [customers'] decisions as easy and as automated as possible," she says.Image copyright Yolt Image caption Smartphones offer the opportunity for reminders and automation We make big changes at important times in our lives, so we might review our finances when we move home, or when children are born.Yet reminders can work on a more regular basis, if they are well-timed, according to Ms Costa.Research in Mexico showed three-quarters of workers whose wages were paid into their bank account immediately took the money out in cash.They received a message on pay day urging them to keep it in.BBC News has set up a UK Facebook group all about affordable living.Share your ideas and join the conversation at the Affordable Living group here.One trial being planned in the UK is at supermarket check-outs, both physical and for online shoppers.The idea is that the shopper receives a message at the check-out asking whether they would like the equivalent of money saved from store discounts to be diverted automatically into a savings account.The team also plans to test the same theory with longer-term savings.This would prompt people to save some of their wages into a "sidecar account" alongside any pension savings.Employees would contribute in the same way as a pension, but the extra would go into a more easily accessible savings account for a rainy day, or to pay emergency bills.Other trials are planned or already in operation to help people pay off debt quicker, or block spending on gambling sites.Prizes at the end of the tunnel Ms Costa explains that when it comes to finances, people often display "tunnelling" behaviour, when their short-term decisions clash with their long-term interests.For example, someone squeezed for cash may borrow a payday loan rather than save the same amount by switching to a cheaper energy deal.We also tend to value rewards that are offered today rather than in the long-term.That is why prize-linked savings accounts are popular.One study in South Africa found savings increased by 38% when people were offered the chance to win a cash prize rather than being paid interest.In the UK, Premium Bonds have been attracting people in much the same way for 60 years.It is the most popular savings product in the country.Yet, Ms Costa argues that for some people on low incomes, the 25 minimum investment may be too expensive.Many will argue that the financially squeezed need a little more help, as well as a little more luck.
How does it feel to be watched at work all the time?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There is a wrong and right way to carry out workplace surveillance Is workplace surveillance about improving productivity or simply a way to control staff and weed out poor performers?Courtney Hagen Ford, 34, left her job working as a bank teller because she found the surveillance she was under was "dehumanising".Her employer logged her keystrokes and used software to monitor how many of the customers she helped went on to take out loans and fee-paying accounts."The sales pressure was relentless," she recalls."The totality was horrible."She decided selling fast food would be better, but ironically, left the bank to do a doctorate in surveillance technology.Courtney is not alone in her dislike of this kind of surveillance, but it's on the rise around the world as firms look to squeeze more productivity from their workers and become more efficient.Image copyright Courtney Hagen Ford Image caption Courtney Hagen Ford says having her every move monitored was "dehumanising" More than half of companies with over $750m (574m) in annual revenue used "non-traditional" monitoring techniques on staff last year, says Brian Kropp, vice-president of research firm Gartner.These include tools to analyse e-mails, conversations, computer usage, and employee movements around the office.Some firms are also monitoring heart rates and sleep patterns to see how these affect performance.In 2015, 30% used such tools.Next year, Mr Kropp expects 80% will.And workforce analytics will be a $1.87bn industry by 2025, says San Francisco's Grand Review Research.So why is business so keen?Ben Waber, chief executive of Humanyze, a Boston workplace analytics company, says it gives firms the ability to assess how their staff are performing and interacting, which can be good for the firm but also good for employees themselves.Image copyright Robin Lubbock Image caption Humanyze's Ben Waber thinks firms need to find our more about how they function His company gathers "data exhaust" left by employees' email and instant messaging apps, and uses name badges equipped with radio-frequency identification (RFID) devices and microphones.These can check how much time you spend talking, your volume and tone of voice, even if you dominate conversations.While this may sound intrusive - not to say creepy - proponents argue that it can also protect employees against bullying and sexual harassment.Humanyze calls these badges "Fitbit for your career".Some of this data analysis can produce unexpected results, says Mr Waber.For example, one large tech client discovered that coders who sat at 12-person lunch tables tended to outperform those who regularly sat at four-person tables.The larger tables led to more interaction with staff from other parts of the company, he says, and this improved idea sharing.Larger lunch tables were "driving more than a 10% difference in performances".A fact that would probably have gone undetected without such data analysis.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The chip allows employees to open doors and use the photocopier without a traditional pass card Over the last few years a Stockholm co-working space called Epicenter has gone much further and holds popular "chipping parties", where people can have RFID-enabled rice-sized microchips implanted in their hands.They can use the implants to access electronically controlled doors, swap contacts, or monitor how typing speed correlates with heart rate, says Epicenter's Hannes Sjblad, who has an implant himself.The implant "cannot transmit any data unless you put it within a centimetre of a reader, so the person with the implant controls when it can be read", he says.Embedded chips may seem extreme, but it is a relatively small step from ID cards and biometrics to such devices, says Prof Jeffrey Stanton, a University of Syracuse academic who researches work-related stress.As long as such schemes are voluntary, "there will probably be a growing number of convenience-oriented uses such that a substantial number of workers would opt to have a chip implanted", he believes.But if embedded chips are used to reduce slack time or rest breaks, "we are probably in the bad zone", he says.And if surveillance tools "take away autonomy", that's when they prove most unpopular.Image copyright Gartner Image caption Gartner's Brian Kropp says bad communication can scupper monitoring projects A lot depends on how such monitoring initiatives are communicated, Gartner's Mr Kropp argues.In 2016, Britain's Telegraph newspaper installed heat and motion monitoring devices under employees' desks.While management said it was to find out which desks were occupied for energy management purposes, staff thought they were being spied on and staged a revolt.The devices were removed after 24 hours.If bosses don't communicate effectively, employees assume the worst, Mr Kropp says.But if they're open about the information they're collecting - and what they're doing with it - 46% of employees are "generally okay with it".Although many such monitoring schemes use anonymised data and participation is voluntary, many staff remain sceptical and fear an erosion of their civil liberties.In less liberal countries, workers are not given any choice at all.But for some, the benefits are obvious.Image copyright Jessica Johnson Image caption Jessica Johnson says her workplace tracking software helps her cope with narcolepsy "I've got a condition called narcolepsy," explains Jessica Johnson, 34, from Canberra, Australia.She falls asleep for short periods during the day, then is disorientated when she wakes.This "impacts my memory, my ability to focus and concentrate," she says.She worked with an insurance company where employees used a programme called Timely to track billable hours.It helped her quickly find what she had been doing before she fell asleep, and pick up where she left off."You install it on your phone, and then on your computer, and that's how you get all the raw data," says Mathias Mikkelsen, Timely's Norwegian chief executive.More Technology of Business "Machine learning algorithms analyse all the data, and create beautiful charts," he says.You can then see how much time you're wasting in unproductive meetings, say, or replying to e-mails.You could show managers you were "spending so much time on stuff that's not what you were hired to do," says Mr Mikkelsen.So workplace surveillance could be empowering for staff and useful for companies looking to become more efficient and profitable.But implemented in the wrong way, it could also become an unpopular tool of oppression that proves counterproductive.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
The estate where neighbours began to ‘vanish’:::::Image caption Families joined forces to protest outside a different, unaffected Taylor Wimpey development It took seven families two years, but a group of homeowners in Scotland has taken on a housing giant in order to have their "crumbling" new-build homes repaired.It's part of a broader, UK-wide issue - this is their story.Sheila Chalmers moved to her estate in Peebles in the Scottish borders with her husband 10 years ago.Her four-bed home was one of 250 built by developer Taylor Wimpey on a new site.For eight years, life went on as normal.Then something strange started to happen.Overnight, families at the top end of the estate started to vanish.But there were no for sale signs and no-one new was moving in."It became almost a ghost street," she says."Houses were empty.People were disappearing."Sheila later heard that the properties had been bought back by Taylor Wimpey after problems were discovered.The owners had signed non-disclosure agreements so they could not speak out.Image caption Sheila paid for assessments by two different structural engineers Taylor Wimpey confirmed it did buy back a "small number of homes" to start with.It later sent a letter to all the remaining residents, saying that some houses did have a problem with the mortar holding together their bricks.Sheila thought she did not have anything to worry about, but she went outside and checked anyway.Patches of mortar were clearly eroding, she says, and in other places it could be scraped out with a fingernail.She paid for assessments by two different structural engineers, who both said the house needed extensive repair work, though Taylor Wimpey said its own inspections found that was not the case.Mortar is made up of two key materials: cement and sand.The more cement in the mix, the stronger the mortar, though the more brittle it can be.The family paid to have their laboratory tests on the mortar carried out by a specialist firm.The results suggested that there was far more sand in the mix than you would expect for a home in that area, although Taylor Wimpey says the type of chemical test used was "not appropriate" and the results could not be relied upon.Our investigation in 2018 found similar complaints about weak mortar across at least 13 estates in the UK all built by different companies.Image caption Jill and Pete Hall say they would never buy a new build house again Three doors down from Sheila, live Pete and Jill Hall with their 13-year-old son.Like Sheila, they first learned about the problem two years ago when Taylor Wimpey were buying back the individual houses.They paid for their own tests, which showed only one in eight samples taken from their home met industry guidelines, although again Taylor Wimpey says the test used was "not appropriate"."On the garage the tests came back showing it was just sand," said Pete.A video filmed by the family after a rainstorm clearly shows the mortar on the back wall falling out when a screwdriver was run gently along it.Handmade signs In the end, seven core households became involved - passing on details to a wider community group on the estate.The families worked together to build their case, paying for their own structural surveys and using Freedom of Information laws to demand internal documents from the local council.They made handmade signs and protested outside the showroom of another Taylor Wimpey estate in the area.In 2017, they presented their findings to Taylor Wimpey's lawyers, saying that they would go public if their properties were not fixed, demolished or bought back.They were surprised at the response.The families' solicitors received a letter back saying they had decided not to report the group to the authorities under the Proceeds of Crime legislation."It was accusing us of bribery, effectively," said Pete."It took me about 10 minutes to stop laughing.But it was intimidation, a threat."Image caption The couple bought a giant shipping container, covered it with warning stickers and left it on their front lawn By then, Pete and Jill had hired their own engineers to examine the house.They recommended that the couple should stop using the garage because it was at risk of collapse, although Taylor Wimpey denies that there was a structural problem.The couple bought a giant shipping container, covered it with warning stickers and left it on their front lawn.That, they say, got Taylor Wimpey's attention and - two years down the line - an agreement has now been reached for their home to be fixed."It falls short of where we think a full repair should be, but they have said it's that or nothing - so we have accepted it," Jill says.'Someone has to stand up' In December 2018, Taylor Wimpey sent out letters saying all 130 houses in the estate built with the weaker mortar would now be offered "remediation" work.Properties are being dealt with one at a time.Construction crews are scraping out the old mortar and replacing it with a stronger material.Taylor Wimpey said it "sincerely apologises" to the all the homeowners affected, is "fully committed to resolving matters" and has "a clear plan in place to remediate affected homes"."This is a localised issue and falls short of the high-quality standards we uphold," it said.The firm has now apologised to Sheila and, even though its own inspections found a full repair is not needed, said work to replace the mortar in her home will start this summer.It will refund some of the 16,000 she has spent on legal costs and technical reports, most of which she had to borrow.Repair work on Pete and Jill's property, which may involve the demolition of the garage, is due to start in mid-July.Both families say the fight has been time-consuming, stressful and put them off ever buying a new-build home again."These developers, these companies, cannot be allowed to continue the destruction of people's lives with building shoddy homes," said Sheila."Somebody has to stand up and show them that they cannot get away with it."What went wrong?Maps drawn up by Taylor Wimpey show about half of the 250 homes were built with far weaker mortar than recommended under industry standards A memo sent to all developers in the UK by the National House Building Council (NHBC) in 2013 warned about this problem The local council in Peebles says the mortar used was not the type in the original building warrant and was changed later without its knowledge Taylor Wimpey says the material was "of sufficient strength to meet structural requirements" as "supported by an independent review" by the local council, but accepts it may be "less durable under prevailing exposure conditions" It says it has now offered to repoint "any home which was constructed with the same mortar, regardless of whether our inspection found this was necessary or not" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter -

Why India is one of world's most protectionist countries:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launches the "Make In India" project The world's largest democratic exercise begins today.Nine hundred million Indians are registered to vote in general elections taking place over the next five weeks.Much is at stake.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised to make India the world's third largest economy by 2030.Meanwhile, the opposition Congress Party has put job creation at the heart of its manifesto.India's trade policy has also come under scrutiny.With some of the highest tariffs in the world, some fear the country is slipping back into its old protectionist ways.A history of protectionism After independence in 1947, India spent decades trying to survive without international trade.The country ditched its model of local production for local consumption following a currency crisis in the early 1990s that forced policymakers to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for help.The IMF cash came with conditions: India had to open up to foreign investment, cut red tape and remove trade barriers.Many saw this as the start of India's reintegration into the global economy, and over the last 20 years liberalisation has connected its young, vibrant workforce with firms around the world.Today, it is one of the world's top outsourcing destinations, with many of its workers powering back-end IT systems, call centres and software development.This has also helped India to run a trade surplus - whereby it sells more than it buys - in goods and services with the US.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Indian workers answer telephone calls at a call-centre in New Delhi The Modi era When Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, he promised to boost India's already impressive growth through further economic liberalisation.And the new government took big steps to make doing business easier, says Rick Rossow, former deputy director at the US-India business council.For example, it combined more than a dozen levies into one national sales tax that helped goods to move seamlessly across state borders.Mr Modi's warmth with global leaders and chief executives - and his oft-lampooned fondness for hugging them - also marked a big shift from past prime ministers.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Modi has sought closer relationships with global chief executives such as Mark Zuckerberg Yet when it comes to its trade, there has been no such progress, with some even accusing the country of travelling backwards.US President Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Indian duties on Harley Davidson motorcycles and American whiskey, despite trade between the two countries having boomed in recent years.In its latest report on global trade barriers, the US trade department singles out India as having the highest tariffs "of any major world economy" - averaging 13.8%.It describes Indian trade policy as opaque, unpredictable, and says it often leaves US firms drowning in paperwork.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Mr Rossow says India's strategy has always been "pro-investment and anti-trade".Flagship government policies such as Make in India have aggressively courted foreign direct investment while seeking to boost domestic manufacturing.To achieve this, India has erected trade barriers against competitors.In the past, western multinationals were the target.Today, China is seen as a rising threat.The BJP used its budget last year to raise import duties on goods including sunglasses, cigarette lighters and fruit juice to discourage Chinese imports.'WTO troublemaker' Mr Modi's government has also spent the last four years defending India's multibillion-dollar food-security programme, which many developed countries see as unfair.Under the programme, the government heavily subsidises local farmers so they can provide low cost food for the poor.But, the US and others argue it breaks World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules around subsidy limits.Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former Australian negotiator at the WTO, thinks they may have a point."India is justifying its agricultural subsidies by claiming their poorest citizens can't afford food, but they're maintaining massive tariff walls that effectively prevent the imports that could bring prices down."Blocking progress?He believes Mr Modi is just grandstanding to show support for the millions of farmers in India - a key voting constituency.This also may explain why India has become such a troublemaker at the WTO over the issue, Mr Grozoubinski adds.Indian trade representatives regularly use obscure legal precedents to stop the Geneva-based body from doing its job, he says, even trying to block rulings on entirely unrelated matters."Domestically it plays well for them to say we're standing up for poor farmers and not letting western countries bully us," he adds.Trade flows and trade talks As the fastest growing major economy in the world, India is unlikely to worry too much about such criticism.It's managed to bring millions of people out of poverty since the millennium, although challenges remain.There is, however, a risk that its protectionism could backfire.Take the way that, last December, the government banned foreign retailers such as Amazon from striking exclusive deals with local goods sellers.The move was viewed as a bid by Mr Modi to placate small traders, also a key voter base.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Would Rahul Gandhi, head of the rival Congress party, change trade policy?But it irked the US and last month the Trump administration said it planned to end a scheme which allows some goods to enter the US duty-free after India refused to remove price caps on some medical devices.India, which was also angered by Washington's refusal to exempt India from steel and aluminium tariffs last year, vowed to retaliate.But it has so far delayed implementing tit-for-tat tariffs."My guess is that they see picking a direct fight with the US as a losing battle and a real danger," Mr Rossow says.Will the election change anything?Trade is unlikely to play a major role in this year's election.Voters are more likely to be concerned about jobs and growth, says Shumita Deveshwar, director of India research at TS Lombard.Others compare Indian protectionism to the "slippery slope" in President Trump's America, where strong growth is overshadowed by a fear of China and a lack of good jobs.Analysts say the risk is that further protectionist measures could reverse the economic gains enjoyed by the country since liberalisation.Ms Deveshwar says India will need to reform on trade if it wants to secure long-term prosperity."India hasn't been able to tap into some of the trade opportunities that have opened up because of the tensions between the US and China, and you've seen other countries such as Vietnam come and take that market share."If the Congress party gains power in May, it is unclear whether it will seek to change India's trade policy, and Mr Rossow believes a second term for Mr Modi will just mean more of the same."This government is all about trying to encourage investment and if it continues [in power], you're going to see another big run at that."The Indian government did not respond to requests for comment on the issues raised in this article.
Cricket World Cup is about 'participation not profit':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Indian cricket star Virat Koli (blue) is one of the big names taking part in the World Cup Twenty years ago Steve Elworthy was part of a talented South African cricket team that crashed out of a World Cup semi-final in the most dramatic fashion possible.As the game reached its climax, the team known as The Proteas needed just one run from four balls to reach the tournament final against Pakistan at Lord's.But, on the verge of glory, batsmen Lance Klusener and Allan Donald contrived to get the latter run out in a shambolically exciting end to the game.Two decades on, 54-year-old Elworthy is now the person in charge of staging this year's International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup in England and Wales.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption South Africa's Steve Elworthy (green) is run out in the 1999 World Cup semi-final And with 50 days until the tournament begins, he says he would welcome such memorable drama at this year's event, even though the pain of that game at Edgbaston, Birmingham, still remains."I can still remember it as though it was yesterday," he says."I was in the changing room, in my pads, having been run out myself not long before, when I saw it all unfold on a TV in the changing rooms.Image caption Former cricketer Steve Elworthy is now an experienced sporting administrator "The whole thing happened in slow motion.We couldn't believe what we were seeing."The changing room was deadly afterwards.There was complete silence for 30 to 40 minutes before we started to gather ourselves.Yet we still got a hero's welcome when we returned to South Africa, despite what had happened."Global TV deals While the drama, and climactic endings, of one-day cricket remains - just look at the 2017 Women's World Cup final that England won by just nine runs - much has changed in the wider world since the 1999 men's tournament.Elworthy has now organised half a dozen global cricketing events for the ICC, and is putting the finishing touches to this year's World Cup.Lasting for six weeks, it will feature stars such as India's Virat Koli, England's Joe Root, and the West Indies' Chris Gayle.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Cricket World Cup trophy has been on a global tour to increase awareness of the event And while this year's event may not make money, Elworthy, says that - given the publicity that will come from wide-ranging global TV deals and over-subscribed ticket sales - making a profit is not the over-riding objective.Rather it is about ensuring cricket remains on the 21st Century sporting and leisure map, at a time when football dominates the back pages, and the power of digital communications means there are competing attractions for people's free time."This will be my sixth ICC tournament," says Elworthy, managing director of the 2019 World Cup."They have tended to be short-sharp tournaments with not a lot of legacy, which is something we want to address this year."He heads up a team of 100 people, based at Lord's Cricket Ground, working to deliver the ICC's global event on behalf of the hosts, the England and Wales Cricket Board.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Getting more children to play cricket is a top priority "When we started to plan for this year back in 2014 we realised there was an opportunity for this Cricket World Cup to get more people to play the game," he says."That became the priority for the event hosts, the ECB, and tournament organisers, the ICC.Clearly there are financial benefits, although it is not our priority," he points out.Sharing the spoils He says the event will have a global TV audience of 1.5 billion viewers.There have also been more than three million applicants for just over 650,000 tickets.The ICC keeps broadcast and sponsor revenues, and the ECB keeps publications and ticket revenues - but has pledged to put the money back into the game - to schools and clubs, and into the tournament itself.Meanwhile, the match venues keep hospitality, food, drink, and car parking revenues.The match venues can use that cash to update facilities, such as investing in changing rooms and new floodlights.Image copyright CWC19 Image caption World Cup ticket numbers have been vastly oversubscribed "We want to engage one million under-16s through the Cricket World Cup," says Elworthy."It is a hugely ambitious number.We want to really stretch the ICC and ECB to achieve that number."We want to get 100,000 young people to watch a World Cup game, and have priced tickets for them at 6 a time."That for me is the main legacy... how to engage with new cricket audiences, and get people to play the games in schools and elsewhere, as well as to watch it."A volunteer programme, along the lines of that successfully used in London 2012 Olympics and Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games, was heavily oversubscribed.The World Cup will also be used to publicise the ECB's All Stars Cricket programme, aimed at giving children aged five to eight a first experience in cricket.'Fantastic format' There has been much debate around the tournament format, which instead of a number of groups, features one large group, with each of the 10 teams playing each other once, before two semi finals and a final."The 1992 World Cup, where there was a round-robin format, was heralded as one of the better ones," says Elworthy."I think all-playing-all is the best format.Every supporter knows where their team is going to play and when.If you have different pools you have uncertainty and fans buying tickets 'on spec' for future games they might not qualify for.The round-robin format has been terrific for us in terms of ticket sales.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Australia are the reigning World Cup champions after defeating New Zealand in 2015 "Every team is guaranteed nine games.You could have a bad result and your prospects change, and suddenly you have to perform to get into the top four and a semi-final place.Or you could have a good few result, and the semi-final is a possibility again."'Upsets and dramas' With such a demand for tickets and only a finite amount available, that plays into the hands of touts."We are doing what we can about it within the confines of the law," says Elworthy."We are very pro-active in this areas.We have our own ticket resale platform in place."He said if organisers were able to identify the seat row and number of tickets appearing on non-sanctioned secondary websites, then they would cancel them.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption England and South Africa open the 2019 World Cup at the Oval on 30 May "There is a very real danger you will not be able to get into games," he warns."We priced tickets at a certain level for a reason, with the lowest price being 16.We want the tournament to be accessible."We want to attract families, with fan zones and lots of interactive and participatory events around games."Looking back to 1999 does he believe there will be anything to compare to that semi final, when South Africa and Australia actually tied the match, but the latter went through after finishing higher in their earlier Super Six table?"There are bound to be upsets and drama," he says."The different playing conditions from the north to the south of the country will play a part too."
How to solve the plastic packaging paradox:::::Image copyright Getty Images Today, plastic packaging has a bad (w)rap.But the first commercially viable version of the now ubiquitous material - cellophane - was conceived in a more innocent age, before anyone worried about plastic in landfill, or the sea, or the food chain.It begins in 1904, at an upmarket restaurant in Vosges, France, when an elderly patron spilled red wine over a pristine linen tablecloth.Sitting at a nearby table was a Swiss chemist called Jacques Brandenberger, who worked for a French textile company.As he watched the waiter change the tablecloth, he wondered about designing a fabric that would simply wipe clean.He tried spraying cellulose on tablecloths but it peeled off in transparent sheets.But might those transparent sheets have a market?Find out more 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.By World War One, he'd found one: eye-pieces for gas masks.He called his invention "cellophane" and in 1923 he sold the rights to the DuPont corporation in America.Its early uses there included wrapping chocolates, perfume and flowers.But DuPont had a problem.Some customers weren't happy.They'd been told cellophane was waterproof, and it was, but it wasn't moisture-proof.Candies stuck to it; knives rusted in it; cigars dried out.DuPont hired a 27-year-old chemist, William Hale Charch, and tasked him with finding a solution.Image copyright Getty Images Within a year, he'd done it - the cellophane was coated with extremely thin layers of nitrocellulose, wax, a plasticiser and a blending agent.Sales took off.The timing was perfect.In the 1930s, supermarkets were changing - customers no longer queued to tell shop assistants what food they required.They picked products off the shelves instead.See-through packaging was a hit.And, as Harvard Business School researcher Ai Hisano points out, had "a significant impact not only on how consumers purchased foods but also on how they understood food quality".Cellophane let them choose food on the basis of how it looked, without sacrificing hygiene or freshness.Image copyright Getty Images One study - admittedly funded by DuPont - found that wrapping crackers in cellophane boosted sales by more than half.And retailers had no shortage of similar advice."She buys meat with her eyes," said a 1938 edition of The Progressive Grocer.In fact, the meat counter was the hardest to make self-service.The problem was that meat, once cut, would quickly discolour.But trials suggested a self-service meat counter could sell 30% more food.With such an incentive, solutions were found: pink-tinted lighting, antioxidant additives and - of course - an improved version of cellophane, which let through just the right amount of oxygen.Image copyright Getty Images By 1949, DuPont adverts boasted about the "pleasing new way" to buy meat - "pre-cut, weighed, priced and wrapped in cellophane right in the store".But cellophane would soon fall out of fashion, overtaken by the likes of Dow Chemical's polyvinylidene chloride.Like its predecessor, this was an accidental discovery first used in conflict - in this case, weatherproofing fighter planes in World War Two.And, like cellophane, it needed plenty of research and development before it could be used on food - it was originally dark green and smelled disgusting.Once Dow sorted that out, it hit the market as Saran Wrap - now more widely known as cling film.More things that made the modern economy: After health scares with polyvinylidene chloride, cling film is now often made with low-density polyethylene, though that's less, well, clingy.It's also used to make those single-use supermarket bags now being banned around the world.High-density polyethylene is the kind of stuff you might get milk in.Image copyright Getty Images Fizzy drinks come in polyethylene terephthalate.And if you're not lost already, consider that plastic packaging is increasingly made from multiple layers of these and other substances, such as biaxially-oriented polypropylene or ethylene-vinyl acetate.There's a reason for this, say packaging gurus - different materials have different properties, so multiple layers can give you the same performance from a thinner - and thus lighter - piece of packaging.But these compound packaging materials are harder to recycle.The trade-off is hard to fathom.Depending on how much of the heavier, recyclable packaging would in practice be recycled, you might find that the lighter, non-recyclable packaging actually generates less waste.And once you start looking into plastic packaging, this kind of counterintuitive conclusion comes up all the time.Some packaging is a foolish waste.But are shrink-wrapped cucumbers really so silly if it means they stay fresh for 14 days rather than three?Image copyright Getty Images Which is worse 1.5g (0.05oz) of plastic wrap or entire cucumbers going off before being eaten?Suddenly it's not so obvious.Plastic bags stop bananas going brown so quickly, or new potatoes going green; they catch grapes that fall off bunches.About a decade ago, one UK supermarket experimented with taking all its fruit and vegetables out of their packaging - and its food wastage rate doubled.And it's not just shelf life - what about waste created before food gets to the shop in the first place?Another supermarket, stung by criticism for putting apples in plastic-wrapped trays, tried selling them loose from big cardboard boxes - but so many were damaged in transit that the approach used more packaging per apple actually sold.Image copyright Getty Images According to a UK government report, only 3% of food is wasted before it gets to shops.In developing countries, that figure can be 50% - and that difference is partly due to how the food is packaged.As more of us live in cities, far from where food is grown, this matters.Even the dreaded single-use shopping bag might not be the villain it seems.If you've bought sturdy, reusable bags from your supermarket, it's likely they're made from non-woven polypropylene - and they are less damaging, but only if you use them at least 52 times.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Anya Hindmarch's I'm not a plastic bag design was meant to discourage single-use plastic bags That's according to a report by the Danish government, which weighed up the varied environmental impacts of producing and disposing of different kinds of bag.And if your reusable bag is organic cotton, don't feel smug - the researchers reckon they need 20,000 uses to justify themselves.That's a shopping trip every day for over half a century.The market can be a wonderful way of signalling popular desires.Shoppers in 1940s America wanted convenient, pre-cut meat - and what economists call the "invisible hand" of the market delivered the technologies that made it possible.But our desire for less waste may not yield to market forces, because the issue is complicated and our choices at the checkout may accidentally do more harm than good.Image copyright Getty Images We can send that message on a more circuitous route only, through governments and pressure groups, and hope that they - and well-meaning industry initiatives - will work out some sensible answers.It seems clear the solution will not be no packaging - it will be better packaging, dreamed up in research and development labs of the kind that gave us moisture-proof cellophane all those decades ago.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economy is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.
Should cyber-security be more chameleon, less rhino?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Do we need to rethink our approach to cybersecurity?Billions are being lost to cyber-crime each year, and the problem seems to be getting worse.So could we ever create unhackable computers beyond the reach of criminals and spies?Israeli researchers are coming up with some interesting solutions.The key to stopping the hackers, explains Neatsun Ziv, vice president of cyber-security products at Tel Aviv-based Check Point Security Technologies, is to make hacking unprofitable."We're currently tracking 150 hacking groups a week, and they're making $100,000 a week each," he tells the BBC."If we raise the bar, they lose money.They don't want to lose money."This means making it difficult enough for hackers to break in that they choose easier targets.And this has been the main principle governing the cyber-security industry ever since it was invented - surrounding businesses with enough armour plating to make it too time-consuming for hackers to drill through.The rhinoceros approach, you might call it.But some think the industry needs to be less rhinoceros and more chameleon, camouflaging itself against attack."We need to bring prevention back into the game," says Yuval Danieli, vice president of customer services at Israeli cyber-security firm Morphisec."Most of the world is busy with detection and remediation - threat hunting - instead of preventing the cyber-attack before it occurs."Morphisec - born out of research done at Ben-Gurion University - has developed what it calls "moving target security".It's a way of scrambling the names, locations and references of each file and software application in a computer's memory to make it harder for malware to get its teeth stuck in to your system.The mutation occurs each time the computer is turned on so the system is never configured the same way twice.The firm's tech is used to protect the London Stock Exchange and Japanese industrial robotics firm Yaskawa, as well as bank and hotel chains.But the most effective way to secure a computer is to isolate it from local networks and the internet completely - so-called air gapping.You would need to gain physical access to the computer to steal data.Image copyright Ben-Gurion University Image caption Yuval Elovici believes that no way of protecting a computer is 100% reliable Yuval Elovici, head of the cyber-security research centre at Ben-Gurion University, warns that even this method isn't 100% reliable."The obvious way to attack an air-gapped machine is to compromise it during the supply chain when it is being built," he says."So you then have a compromised air-gapped computer in a nuclear power station that came with the malware - the attacker never has to enter the premises."Indeed, in October last year, Bloomberg Businessweek alleged that Chinese spies had managed to insert chips on servers made in China that could be activated once the machines were plugged in overseas.The servers were manufactured for US firm Super Micro Computer Inc.The story suggested that Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Apple were among 30 companies, as well as government agencies and departments, that had used the suspect servers.Apple and Amazon strenuously denied the claims.More Technology of Business While air gapping is impractical for many businesses, so-called "co-operative cyber-security" is being seen as another way to thwart the hackers.Imagine there are four firms working together: Barclays, Microsoft, Google and a cyber-security company, say.Each of the four firms gives a piece of data to each other.They don't know what the data is that they are protecting, but they hold it in their networks.In order to access sensitive information from any of the firms, attackers would need to hack all four networks and work out which piece of data is missing, to be able to make any sense of the files stolen."If the likelihood of breaking into a single network is 1%, then to penetrate four different networks, the likelihood would become 0.000001%," explains Alon Cohen, founder of cyber-security firm nsKnox and former chief technology officer for the Israeli military.Image copyright Check Point Image caption Check Point's Neatsun Ziv believes "there's no such thing as an unhackable computer" He calls the concept "crypto-splitting", and it involves encoding each sequence of data as thousands of numbers then dividing these cryptographic puzzles between the four companies."You would need to solve thousands of puzzles in order to put the data back together," says Mr Cohen.Check Point also collaborates with large multinational technology firms in a data-sharing alliance in the belief that co-operation is key to staying one step ahead of the hackers.But while such approaches show promise, Check Point's Neatsun Ziv concludes that: "There is no such thing as an unhackable computer, the only thing that exists is the gap between what you build and what people know how to hack today."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption What could happen if the UK's 5G networks suffered a major cyber-attack?There is always a trade-off between usability and security.The more secure and hack-proof a computer is, the less practical it is in a networked world."Yes, we can build an unhackable computer but it would be like a tank with so many shields that it wouldn't move anywhere," says Morphisec's Mr Danieli.The concern for the cyber-security industry is that as the nascent "internet of things" develops, powered by 5G mobile connectivity, the risk of cyber-attack will only increase.And as artificial intelligence becomes more widespread, it will become just another tool hackers can exploit.The arms race continues.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
'Why I quit as a barrister to follow my dream job':::::Image copyright Mowgli Street Food Image caption Nisha Katona was a barrister before she became a restaurateur The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to 48-year-old Nisha Katona, founder of Mowgli Street Food - a contemporary Indian restaurant chain in the UK.When Nisha Katona decided to quit her successful career as a barrister after 20 years to open a restaurant, her friends and family thought she was having a mid-life crisis.Nisha knew the move would come with risks as she would be giving up a well paid job and had a mortgage to pay.But she had long had a dream to become a professional chef and it was starting to give her sleepless nights.So while she was still working full time in 2014, as a family and child law barrister in Liverpool, she decided to take the plunge and opened Mowgli.Image copyright Mowgli Street Food Image caption Nisha says the food at Mowgli is a "far cry" from what's served at traditional curry houses The Liverpool restaurant, which specialises in "authentic" Indian cuisine, quickly took off and has since grown into a UK-wide chain with sales of 10m."Mowgli is a pet name I have for my two teenage girls which literally means feral child," Nisha says of the name, which is not, as some people think, linked to the famous Jungle Book character."My daughters chose the logo and the restaurant was named after them."The daughter of Indians who emigrated to Lancashire in the 1960s, Nisha was always obsessed with Indian cuisine and even used to plan her holidays around trying new foods.She says she has taken cookery lessons all around the world, but never from professional chefs, only home cooks and "usually grandmothers".Before she launched Mowgli she gave cookery lessons herself, launching her own Youtube channel.And she did lots of market research - for instance, standing in the corner of restaurant kitchens at night to see how they operated.Image copyright Mowgli Street Food Image caption There are now seven Mowgli restaurants across the UK Nisha says Mowgli is about showing how Indians eat at home and on the streets, which is a "far cry" from what you find at traditional UK curry houses.She says her dishes, which are all based on family recipes, are "simple, fresh and delicate" while having a modern twist."What I want is people to understand how my grandmother cooked.This is how we, as Indians, eat at home.We don't have a balti or a bhuna, and we don't have naan breads and poppadoms."Her passion for Indian cuisine has also led her to write three of her own cookbooks - Pimp My Rice, The Spice Tree and Mowgli Street Food.Image copyright Mowgli Street Food Image caption Nisha has written several cook books "I still remember when I wrote my first cook book.I'd never written a book in my life, so I thought how do I publish this?I looked in the Jamie Oliver cook book and Googled some of the names in his acknowledgments."One was his agent and so I sent her my proposal, and within 10 minutes she wrote back to me and said 'can we meet on Monday'?And she signed me on."But despite her success, Nisha says starting her first restaurant wasn't easy.As a second-generation immigrant living in 1970s Britain, she had developed "a thick skin" early on in life, and she had been the first female Asian barrister in Liverpool.But she was still unprepared for the pressures she faced as a woman entering the male-dominated restaurant scene.More The Boss features: "As I was building Mowgli, at times I was met with disdain from friends and family as I threw myself into the business and had less time to spend with my daughters."It struck me that if I were the husband, or simply the man, I wouldn't receive this criticism.And unfortunately, in this day and age, I still must fight my corner as a businesswoman."The fact there were so few female role models in the industry didn't help, she says, as she would have loved a woman to have "guided her or been a mentor".Today the entrepreneur runs seven successful Mowgli restaurants in cities such as Manchester, Birmingham and Oxford.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Nisha Katona was given an MBE this year "The fact that Nisha has opened not one or two but seven restaurants in the UK, in just over four years, means she is definitely doing something right, especially in today's highly competitive food industry," says Mr Yawar Khan, head of the Asian Catering Federation.He also says giving up her job and starting a new career in her 40s took "courage and guts"."South Asian women need more role models like Nisha to encourage them to start restaurants and curry houses."Earlier this year Nisha achieved another milestone when she made The New Year Honours list and was awarded an MBE in recognition of her services to the British food industry."It just felt like a blessing.It was almost as though we got royal assent for my mother's dhal," she says."It was the most moving moment and what it meant to my mother, who came to England 50 years ago with nothing, is beyond words."
The nations of the Amazon want the name back:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Amazon countries say giving control of the domain to the tech giant could impact on their sovereignty Online retail giant Amazon and the governments of eight South American countries have been given a final deadline to reach an agreement over how to use the ".amazon" web address extension after a seven-year dispute.What will happen next?It's a name that evokes epic proportions: the world's largest rainforest; a global tech company; and now a diplomatic saga nearing its end.This is the battle of the Amazon and it starts back in 2012.The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the body that polices the world wide web's address system, decided to expand its list of generic top-level domains (gTLD) - the bit that comes after the dot in a web address.The new rules allowed companies to apply for brand new extensions, offering internet users and businesses more ways to personalise their website name and addresses.But eight countries containing the Amazon rainforest objected to the retail giant's plans concerning the new .amazon domain name.Image caption The case is pitting Amazon rainforest countries against the US tech giant The governments of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela - all members of the Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization (ACTO) - say that relinquishing the domain exclusively to Amazon could impact on matters of their sovereignty.Diplomats have told the BBC that they are not seeking to deny Amazon use of the domain but are proposing a "shared governance" of it.According to their proposals, Amazon would be immediately allowed to use the domains which are relevant to its commercial interests, such as "books.amazon" or "kindle.amazon".But each country in turn would be entitled to use domains which relate to their cultural heritage - imagine Amazon nations coming together to promote the region under the "tourism.amazon" domain, for example.Crucially, the countries want to establish a committee in which both Amazon and the eight countries would have the opportunity to object to new top-level domains in the future.But Amazon has rejected these proposals, instead suggesting that the .amazon extension be used in conjunction with two letters representing each country - br.amazon for Brazil, for example.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Users can now end their website names with more than 1,200 new extensions, including .blog and .you The company has declined to comment ahead of the 7 April deadline, but pointed to previous remarks by its vice-president of public policy, Brian Huseman, who vowed that Amazon "will not use the TLDs in a confusing manner".Amazon has promised to work with governments to identify and block the use of "names that touch national sensitivities" and has pledged to support a new top-level domain using local terms such as .amazonia and .amazonas.And last year it tried to persuade the countries by promising them $5m (3.8m) worth of free Kindle e-readers and hosting services.They turned down the offer.In a letter sent to ICANN in March, the Ecuadorian Ambassador to the US, Francisco Carrin, said: "We are not looking for financial compensation.Nor are we after ex-gratia concessions to use one or a few second-level domains."It is a matter of sovereignty for many of us, and the offer to share the TLDs with the company Amazon Inc. is already a compromise."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Other contentious cases of geographical TLDs include .patagonia and .africa The current dispute follows similar cases already settled.In 2013, for example, the US-based outdoor clothing brand Patagonia withdrew an application for the .patagonia extension after objection from Argentina and Chile.A Mexico-based company had to reach a financial agreement with the town of Bar, Montenegro, in order to obtain consent to register the .bar extension.And in 2016, ICANN granted the registry of the .africa gTLD to a charity based in Johannesburg, South Africa, after it received support from three quarters of African Union countries.But the Amazon saga has been quite unlike any other.More Technology of Business Amazon's application was initially deferred, but Brazilian and Peruvian diplomats managed to overturn it by securing the support of the group that represents governments within ICANN - the GAC.That in itself required diplomatic pressure to change the US position from supporting Amazon Inc. to remaining neutral in the dispute.Then Amazon appealed and a review panel ordered ICANN to make a decision by reaching its own conclusions.If the parties don't reach a consensus by 7 April, Amazon will have two weeks to argue its case again before ICANN makes up its mind.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption ICANN is under pressure to resist the push of governments concerning geographic domain names The case is prompting questions about the independence of ICANN.Amazon's Brian Huseman told ICANN that "globally, hundreds (if not thousands) of brands have names similar to regions, land formations, mountains, towns, cities, and other geographic places".These could be put off applying for new gTLDs because of "uncertainty" over ICANN policy over geographic names.The US-based body is under pressure to resist the push of governments and some believe it might be more open to arguments coming from the business sector this time around.But Daniel Sepulveda, who served as a US Ambassador, deputy assistant secretary of state, and co-ordinator for communications and information policy from 2013 to 2017, says: "The ICANN community would make a mistake if it diminishes Brazil's concerns or engages in aggressive libertarian rhetoric".He believes ICANN needs to strike a fine balance between the interests and freedoms of businesses, organisations and individuals using the internet, without alienating anyone."This is a sensitive situation that requires diplomacy, the exercise of mutual respect, and creative mechanisms for ensuring all sides feel fairly treated," he says.So if Amazon and the eight nations don't reach agreement before the deadline, ICANN has a very difficult decision to make - one that might end up pleasing no-one.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Uruguay: The world’s marijuana pioneer:::::Image copyright IRCCA Image caption Uruguay legalised marijuana for recreational use in 2013 Uruguay was the first country in the world to legalise recreational cannabis.Five years after its pioneering law was passed, how's the industry getting on?"We sold a lot of cannabis on the first day," says Esteban Riviera, who owns a large, modern-looking pharmacy in Montevideo, Uruguay's capital."We sold 1,250 packages in six hours.There was a two-block queue to get marijuana."The legal sale of cannabis had been much anticipated.Sales began on 19 July 2017, more than three-and-a-half years after Uruguay's marijuana law had been passed."It took them time, the government said, because they want to do it precisely and step by step," explains Guillermo Draper, a Uruguayan journalist who's co-written a book on his country's pioneering experiment.Image caption Marijuana can only be sold in pharmacies But this assiduous approach to implementing the marijuana law wasn't enough to avoid a serious hiccup."My bank told me either stop selling cannabis or close my accounts," says Esteban Riviera, the pharmacist."I stopped selling cannabis."I was the first pharmacy registered to sell cannabis," he adds, chuckling drily at the irony, "but I was also the first pharmacy that stopped selling cannabis in Uruguay."Lenders like Esteban's rely on partnerships with US banks for their international transactions.But those partnerships came under threat when the US banks learnt their Uruguayan counterparts were accepting marijuana money.Uruguay might be a sovereign country, but it's still affected by the US's strict finance laws on controlled substances.Pharmacies are the only places allowed to sell recreational marijuana in Uruguay and - partly because of the restrictions facing banks - there are only 17 doing so in a country of 3.5 million people.Image caption Uruguay also controls the strength of the marijuana being sold So, 18 months after marijuana went on sale, the novelty may have waned, but the queues haven't."I am standing in the sun, burning hot, waiting for 2pm when they'll start selling," explains a young woman in the queue outside another Montevideo pharmacy - one still selling cannabis."This is one of the pharmacies who have more packages to sell without reserving online.There's a lot of pharmacies who have less, so a lot of people go home without weed and that's pretty sad."The system is tightly controlled.Customers have to register with the regulator and then are limited to buying 10 grams a week, enough for about 20 joints.The regulator also controls how strong the marijuana is.The level of THC - the psychoactive part of cannabis that gets you high - is limited and balanced with the level of CBD, another compound in the plant that's said to have a calming effect.Image caption Customers queue outside a pharmacy to buy cannabis In pharmacies, there are just four different strains available to buy, none of which is especially strong.The price - about 5 for a five-gram packet - is also set by the regulator.Pharmacy owner Gabriel Llano says he only gets about 20% of the purchase price from each packet he sells, although there's a higher profit margin on related products like snacks and smoking papers, which are a slightly odd sight in a pharmacy.When sales begin, customers come in one at a time and put a thumb and finger on a print reader to prove that they're registered to buy - and haven't already reached their limit for the month.Then they hand over their cash.It has to be cash, Gabriel explains, because that's the condition on which his bank has let him keep his account.The bank's official line is that it doesn't work with businesses linked to cannabis and that it's continuing to close the accounts of such businesses "when appropriate".The rationale for changing the law here was to move buyers from the illegal market to a new legal one.But the queues outside pharmacies suggest that in the legal market, supply isn't meeting demand.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: "In Uruguay, no one had ever grown marijuana on a big scale before," says Diego Olivera, the secretary-general of Uruguay's National Drugs Board, who also oversees the cannabis regulator, IRCCA.He says that now cannabis firms are more experienced, "we anticipate that they are going to be able to produce at a faster pace".IRCCA also plans to issue four or five new licences to grow recreational marijuana, as only two firms are currently permitted to produce the plant.Diego accepts that Uruguay's approach has been more cautious than that of some US states where marijuana has been legalised.That's meant recreational sales haven't been bringing in big profits for the companies involved.But the government is much more supportive of businesses growing marijuana for medicinal use, which was also legalised under the 2013 law.Image caption One of the most accepted uses of medicinal cannabis is for chronic pain, says Helena Gonzalez Ramos Local producers have been trying to capitalise on this opportunity.ICC Labs, one of the two licensed growers of recreational marijuana, is also involved in medicinal marijuana, which has higher profit margins and a rising number of potential export markets.This is perhaps why a big Canadian cannabis company - Aurora - recently paid $220m (167m) to buy ICC.Aurora said that the deal would position it as the market leader in Latin America.In October last year, Canada became the second country in the world to legalise recreational marijuana but its medicinal market has been going since 2001.The medicinal side of ICCs business is focused on the extraction of CBD from marijuana.Fotmer, a privately owned firm, is the first with a licence to produce THC for medicinal use."One of the most accepted uses of THC is for chronic pain, specifically when it is neuropathic," Helena Gonzalez Ramos, Fotmer's manager of quality and research and development, explains."That is rigidity in your muscles, palliative care, vomiting [and] nausea."Uruguay's approach to recreational marijuana has limited the business potential of the industry.But when it comes to medicinal marijuana, Uruguayan companies like Fotmer are aiming to help shape a rapidly growing global industry."The main markets nowadays are Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Germany, and some others, mainly in Europe," Helena says."And the regulation is changing all the time so the forecasts are also promising as medical marijuana is legalised around the world."For more on this story, you can listen to the World Service's Global Business radio programme on Uruguay and its marijuana laws.
Paternity leave: 'All of my dad friends were incredibly jealous':::::Image copyright Piers Fenwick Image caption Piers Fenwick with his sons Matthew and William It's the dream of many dads: being able to spend more time with their children.For many people, work commitments make it difficult to have as much time as they would like with their growing kids.And right from the start, pressure on families is not helped if it's only possible to take a short paternity leave.But what would it be like if firms let dads take six months paid paternity leave?'It was fantastic' In 2017, Aviva, which at the time was the UK's largest insurer, started to let all new parents have the same amount of paid leave.Piers Fenwick, who works for Aviva in Norwich as an analyst on its fraud team, recently took six months off around the birth of his youngest son, William."It was just a really great opportunity to help my wife, bond with my new son, and spend time with my eldest," "I think my wife quite liked having me around.Fingers crossed," he says.Piers is 31, and is married to Kylie Fenwick, 30.They have two children: Matthew, who is two, and William, six months."Overall, it was fantastic, and all of my dad friends were incredibly jealous," he says."A lot of them work for companies that just do the statutory two weeks, and they would have to take unpaid or shared parental leave [to get the same amount of time off]."'Part of the family' Piers is one of hundreds of employees at Aviva who have taken advantage of the perk.In the UK, 496 Aviva employees used the policy in the first 10.5 months - 268 female, and 228 male workers.Piers says that being able to take the chunk of paid paternity leave didn't exactly bind him to the firm, but had made him want to give back."It really does motivate you in thinking this company cares.It makes you feel part of the family."He adds that "it would really take something very special to be a more attractive proposition" in terms of moving to a different employer."I really don't know what it would take to tempt me away."Paid leave While it is not widespread in the UK, two big UK firms this week announced they will be extending paid paternity leave.On Monday, mobile operator O2 said it will increase its paid paternity leave to 14 weeks for all permanent employees, covering heterosexual and same-sex couples, as well as adoptive and surrogate partners.And on Wednesday, drinks giant Diageo said its 4,500 employees will be able to get an equal 52 weeks parental leave, with the first 26 weeks fully paid.Mairad Nayager, chief HR officer at Diageo said: "True gender equality in the working world requires fundamental changes to a broad range of working practices, including a shake-up of the policies and cultural norms around parental leave."Today's announcement is about matching ambition with action and supporting all of our colleagues - regardless of gender - to experience the joy of raising a young family, while continuing to thrive at work."High employment HR professional body the CIPD said some employers "recognise the need for greater balance when it comes to parenting and are increasing paternity leave and pay as a result".Claire McCartney, CIPD diversity and inclusion adviser, said: "Parental leave is a key way of supporting parents in the workplace.It can help them to establish a strong relationship with their children and gives them time to set up childcare systems that work for them going forward."Ms McCartney added that firms were increasingly having to compete for employees.In February, UK employment hit another record high."With a tight labour market, employers also know they need to stand out from the crowd," she said."Those organisations that offer attractive parental leave and pay policies will be more desirable to working parents who represent a high proportion of the workforce."However, a spokesperson for the Institute of Directors said small firms operated under different constraints to large firms.While many small firms were sympathetic to the needs of parents, and were encouraging flexible working, they were also dealing with other pressures and costs, such as this week's introduction of the HMRC Making Tax Digital scheme, the spokesperson said.
The teenage hackers who've been given a second chance:::::Image copyright Getty Images Step inside the offices of Bluescreen and you'll find some of the UK's most talented young hackers, dragged from a world of crime to fight for the other side.These computer experts have swapped the confines of their bedrooms for a fairly ordinary looking cyber-security company in Plymouth.Bluescreen employs hackers the authorities have deemed worthy of a second chance, who pit their wits against some of the anonymous online criminals they used to see as brothers in arms.Image caption Jack stole personal information from thousands of people When Jack was 19 years old, the police sent five squad cars, a tech team and a riot van to his home."It was about 08:10 in the morning.I'd had the most awful night's sleep and I'd just started watching The Lion King."It didn't even get past the intro before my bedroom door flew open and 10 police officers came in to arrest me."I was not expecting that on any day of my life."The police were there for a good reason: when he was 16, Jack had stolen personal information from about 1,000 people.He told police he'd never had any intention of using it for his own gain; to him, it was just an intellectual exercise.Stories like this are not uncommon at Bluescreen IT, which has a direct link with the police to find hackers in need of direction.These are young men who have been accused of serious crimes, but instead of being taken through the criminal justice system, they've been given a second chance.About 15 people work in the Security Operations Centre, a handful of whom have been referred to the company as hackers who aren't malicious in nature and are deemed capable of reform.Image caption Cameron launched cyber attacks, and was caught by the National Crime Agency Another employee, Cameron, was arrested on his way to school when he was just 14 years old.Officers from the National Crime Agency had planned the sting so that Cameron would be out of the house, and unable to destroy his hard drives in the event he heard them coming."Up to that point my biggest worry was that I hadn't done my maths homework," he said."I was walking to school when I heard my name being called.I turned round and there was a man in a suit walking behind me."Then I heard him say my name louder, so I turned around and said 'yeah?'and that's when he told me I was under arrest."I turned around and there were five more officers spread out across the grass."I just didn't realise that what I'd done was that serious.It was all just one big joke - messing around - it never seemed like I was actually causing any real harm.I soon found out how serious it was.""Grey hat hackers" like Jack and Cameron are seen as having committed their crimes for reasons that weren't to do with personal gain or cyber-terrorism.Sometimes it might have been a practical joke, or perhaps the motive was to launch a server-debilitating attack.Now they try to stop others - using the methods they once employed - from wreaking the same havoc.Image copyright Getty Images Hackers' hats White hat hackers - These are the nice guys of the hacking world.They know what they're doing and they use their talents for good, such as getting rid of viruses or legitimately testing the security systems of companies and governments.Black hat hackers - The bad guys.They're the ones who steal your bank details and sell them on the dark web.They usually hack for personal gain, although it could be some form of cyber-espionage or protest.Grey hat hackers - Somewhere in between.They might hack a company without permission, only to point out the flaws without exploiting them.What they're doing is still illegal.The route into a life of hacking isn't always the same, but a lot of the stories are similar, and they often start with gaming.When he was younger, Cameron liked to tinker with things to see how they worked."I didn't like my high scores being beaten in video games - I always had to be the best at them."He started making "mods" to video games - changes to the code that enabled him to get higher scores - which he said led him to online forums, and then darker areas of the internet."I ended up launching cyber attacks, and was later caught by the National Crime Agency," Cameron said.You may also be interested in: Image caption The team at Bluescreen has some big personalities, and people from vastly different backgrounds For Jack, now 23, it was his "laziness" that led him into the world of computing."I was 12.We'd just started doing algebra, but I didn't want to do it."I went home and tried to make a calculator for algebra.It didn't really go well, but that is my earliest memory of that side of things."I was trying to cut corners any way I could.Rather than studying, I would try and make it look like I was studying and doing well."I'd be failing in all my classes but pull it out of the bag at the last minute.After a while the school had had enough of me."I got my five GCSEs in Year 10 and then the school expelled me."Just four years after his arrest, Jack is now working at an advanced level, carrying out processes like penetration testing - trying to break into clients' servers to find weaknesses.He and Cameron, now 19, also defend against incoming attacks - an area where their hacking experience comes in handy.Image caption Det Sgt John Atkin found himself attending the same course as Cameron, who he arrested in 2014 One of the more surreal moments in Cameron's first year at Bluescreen was going on the same course as the police officer who had arrested him in 2014.Det Sgt John Atkin from the South West Regional Cyber Crime Unit was attending a Bluescreen security course as part of his own professional development.Cameron said: "It's unbelievable - what are the chances of that?"I never would've thought when he was arresting me as a 14-year-old kid, that we'd one day be on the same course."There's an element of learning from each other now.Whenever something comes up in forensics he's the man to explain it best; we're lucky to have him there."And then for the attacks I can explain it better."We always got along, but I don't think John appreciated much of what I did."Det Sgt Atkin has "no problem" meeting the hackers he's arrested because the whole point of the police Cyber Futures programme is to "try and develop people"."What you can see here is that by working with Cameron and his family, and providing the support and knowledge we have, we're able to deliver and put him in a place where his future is set, rather than where he could have been."Cameron's a good kid so he's doing really well; the future's bright for him.Hopefully, he'll take this forward and then the world's his oyster."Image caption The Security Operations Centre is where the analysts defend incoming attacks There's a relaxed atmosphere when you walk into the Security Operations Centre, but it's serious work.Three monitors on the wall detail which of Bluescreen's clients are being attacked, and how serious the threat is.The clients, mostly smaller and medium-sized businesses from around the South West, are given codenames like "Black Mamba" or "Green Starfish" - usually a colour and an animal.The business has just won part of a 500,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to encourage more diverse candidates into cyber-security jobs, meaning it can keep growing, and potentially take on more former hackers.As apprentices, employees like Jack and Cameron start on a wage of about 650 a month, but after five years of experience they could easily be earning close to 50,000 a year.But for some reformed hackers, moving into a professional environment can be a big adjustment: even getting out of bed on time is sometimes a bit of a struggle for young men used to working unsupervised, to their own schedule and their own rules.Now they must do regular office hours as part of a team dedicated to protecting the interests of the company's clients.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Adjusting to a nine-to-five job isn't always easy for Bluescreen's former hackers It's not just a challenge for the new recruits: some of the hackers who arrive at Bluescreen are autistic, which isn't something that management have had much experience of dealing with."It's been a really hard journey for us and a massive learning curve," said the company's chief operating officer, Richard Cashmore."We've had to adapt how we manage people - if they need to work in a certain space, we'll go and do that."It's about give and take - we can't bend over too far for them because we need them to be employable, but we meet in the middle."Bluescreen sees itself as a place to develop young people, give them a second chance, and be a haven for those with nowhere else to go."It makes me really proud when they achieve industry-recognised qualifications," said Mr Cashmore."It's a big deal for them and it's a big deal for us, because we invest a lot of time and emotional effort into these guys, and seeing them succeed after everything we've all been through is very satisfying."
What can bees teach economists about how markets work?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It's a little known fact that economists love bees - or at least, the idea of bees.The Royal Economic Society's logo is a honeybee.The Fable Of The Bees, published in 1732, uses honeybees as a metaphor for the economy - and anticipates modern economic concepts such as the division of labour and the "invisible hand" that means "greed is good".And when a future winner of the Nobel Prize in economics, James Meade, was looking for an example of a tricky idea in economic theory, he turned to the honeybee for inspiration.The tricky idea was what economists call a "positive externality" - something good that a free market won't produce enough of, meaning that the government might want to subsidise it.For James Meade, the perfect example of a positive externality was the relationship between apples and bees.Imagine, wrote Meade in 1952, a region containing some orchards and some bee-keeping.If the apple farmers planted more apple trees, the bee-keepers would benefit, because that would mean more honey.But the apple farmers wouldn't enjoy that benefit, that positive externality, and so they wouldn't plant as many apple trees as would be best for everyone.This was, according to Meade, "due simply and solely to the fact that the apple farmer cannot charge the bee-keeper for the bees' food".But there's a problem with his thesis.Apple blossom produces almost no honey.And that's only the first thing James Meade didn't know about bees.Find out more: 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast.To understand Meade's more fundamental error, we need a brief history of humans and honeybees.Once upon a time, there was no bee-keeping - only honey hunting, trying to steal honeycombs from wild bees.We see this depicted in cave paintings.Then, at least 5,000 years ago, the practice was formalised.The Greeks, the Egyptians, and the Romans were all partial to domesticated honey.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ancient Egyptians attached great religious and spiritual significance to the honeybee By the Middle Ages, bee-keepers were using skep hives - they're the classic woven beehives that look like a tapering stack of straw tyres.But the trouble with skep hives is that if you want the honey, you need to get rid of the bees - and bee-keepers would generally poison them with sulphurous smoke, shake them off, scoop out the honey, and worry about building another bee colony in due course.In time, though, people started to worry about this waste and disdain for a creature that not only gives us honey but also pollinates our plants.In the 1830s, a bee-rights movement emerged in the US, with the motto: "Never kill a bee."And, in 1852, the US Patent Office awarded patent number 9300A to clergyman Lorenzo Langstroth for a moveable-frame beehive.Image copyright Science Photo Library The Langstroth hive is a wooden box with an opening at the top and frames that hang down, carefully separated from each other by the magic gap of 8mm (0.3in) "bee space" - any smaller, or larger, and the bees start adding their own inconvenient structures.The queen is at the bottom, confined by a "queen excluder" - a mesh that prevents her entry but permits worker bees through.This keeps her bee larvae out of the honeycombs.The honeycombs are easily pulled out and harvested by a spinning centrifuge that flings out, filters and collects the honey.A marvel of design and efficiency, this new hive allowed the industrialisation of the bee.And it's this industrialisation that James Meade hadn't quite grasped.The honeybee is a thoroughly domesticated animal.Image copyright Alamy Image caption Writer Sylvia Plath, whose father was a bee expert, wrote a series of vivid poems about the physicality of bee-keeping and extracting honey With Langstroth hives, bees are portable.Nothing stops farmers coming to some financial arrangement with bee-keepers to locate hives amid their crops.A couple of decades after James Meade's famous example, another economist, Steven Cheung, became curious about it - and he did something we economists perhaps don't do often enough: he called up some real people and asked them what actually happens.More things that made the modern economy: He discovered that apple farmers routinely paid bee-keepers for the service of pollinating their crops.For some other crops, the bee-keepers do indeed pay farmers for the right to harvest their nectar, the market Meade said should exist but could not.One example is mint, which doesn't need any help from bees but which produces good honey.So apples and bees aren't a good example of a positive externality, because the interaction does take place in a marketplace.And that marketplace is huge.These days, its centre of gravity is the California almond industry.Almonds occupy almost a million acres (4,000 sq km) of California - and farmers sell about $5bn (3.9bn) worth per year.Almonds need honeybees - five colonies per hectare (10,000 sq m), rented for about $185 (144) a colony.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bees play a crucial role in California's almond industry Langstroth hives are duly strapped together, loaded on to the back of articulated lorries, 400 hives per truck, and driven to the Californian almond groves each spring, travelling by night while the bees are asleep.The numbers are astonishing: 85% of the two million commercial hives in the US are moved, containing tens of billions of bees.As Bee Wilson describes in The Hive: The Story of the Honeybee and Us, the big US bee-keepers manage 10,000 hives each and from California they may travel up to Washington state's cherry orchards, then east to the sunflowers of North and South Dakota and then on to the pumpkin fields of Pennsylvania or the blueberries of Maine.Meade was quite wrong to imagine beekeeping as some kind of rural idyll.Bees have been almost fully industrialised, and pollination thoroughly commercialised.And that presents a conundrum.Ecologists are worried about wild bee populations, which are in sharp decline in many parts of the world.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The fall in global bee number has been linked to the use of neonicotinoid insecticides Nobody quite knows why.Candidates for blame include parasites, pesticides and the mysterious "colony collapse disorder", where bees simply disappear, leaving a lone queen behind.New clues to decline of bees and other pollinators Can listening to bees help save them - and us?Why do we hate wasps and love bees?Domesticated bees face the same pressures, so you might expect to see some simple economics at work - a reduction in the supply of bees increasing the price of pollination services.But that's not what economists see at all.Colony collapse disorder appears to have had minimal effect on any practical metric in the bee market.Farmers are paying much the same for pollination, and the price of new queens - which are specially bred - has hardly budged.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Queen bees are vital to the wellbeing of their hive and there is a large market for specially bred ones It appears that industrial bee-keepers have managed to develop strategies for maintaining the populations on which they rely: breeding and trading queens, splitting colonies and buying booster packs of bees.That is why there is no shortage of honey - or almonds, or apples, or blueberries - not yet, anyway.Should we celebrate economic incentives for preserving at least some populations of bees?Well, maybe.Another perspective is that it's precisely the modern economy's longstanding drive to control and monetise the natural world that caused the problem in the first place.Before monocrop agriculture changed ecosystems, there was no need to lug Langstroth hives around the countryside to pollinate crops - local populations of wild insects did the job free of charge.So if we want an example of a positive externality - something the free market won't provide as much of as society would like - perhaps we should look to land uses that help wild bees and other insects.Wildflower meadows, perhaps - and some governments are indeed subsidising these, just as James Meade would have advised.The author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economyis broadcast on the BBC World Service.You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes onlineor subscribe to the programme podcast.
Gender pay gap: What is the pay gap where I work?:::::With the deadline for British companies to disclose their gender pay gaps just days away, thousands of firms have yet to submit their figures.Three-quarters of firms pay men more than they pay women on average, based on those who have reported so far.To find out the pay gap at your company, use the lookup below.All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps.Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women.How big is the pay gap at...?Type in a company name below ...for every 10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]] Number of companies by pay gap >50 25 0% 25 >50 If you cannot see the calculator, please click here Understanding the terminology Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man.If you line up all the men and women working at a company in two separate lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his.Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend per woman and its total spend per man.The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation.Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay.Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work.That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970.A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things - for example, fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs.This article is based on the difference in what men and women are paid per hour, but there are other ways of calculating the gender pay gap: the Office for National Statistics releases annual figures here.How does the BBC calculator work?The individual company data reflects the information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office as of 1 April.The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the "snapshot date" - the previous year.For businesses and charities, 5 April is the snapshot date, while 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations.All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.Calculator design and development: Irene de la Torre Arenas, Becky Rush, Scott Jarvis, Alexander Ivanov and Oliver Schnuck.
What's the new weapon against money laundering gangsters?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gangster Al Capone was eventually convicted of tax evasion in 1931 Money laundering accounts for up to 5% of global GDP - or $2tn (1.5tn) - every year, says the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.So banks and law enforcement agencies are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to help combat the growing problem.But will it work?Money laundering, so-called after gangster Al Capone's practice of hiding criminal proceeds in cash-only laundromats in the 1920s, is a huge and growing problem."Dirty" money is "cleaned" by passing it through layers of seemingly legitimate banks and businesses and using it to buy properties, businesses, expensive cars, works of art - anything that can be sold on for new cash.And one of the ways criminals do this is called "smurfing".Specialist software is used to arrange lots of tiny bank deposits that slip below the radar, explains Mark Gazit, chief executive of ThetaRay, a financial crime AI provider headquartered in Israel."A $0.25 transaction will never be spotted by a human, but transactions of that kind can launder $30m if they are done hundreds of millions of times," he says.And stolen money is often laundered to fund further criminal activity.One recent ATM (cash machine) scam cost banks 1bn (854m) in total across 40 countries, for example.Image copyright ThetaRay Image caption ThetaRay boss Mark Gazit says AI can spot patterns of criminal behaviour "The gang hacked into thousands of ATMs and programmed them to release up to five notes at a certain time - say 3am - at which point a local criminal or 'money mule' would pick it up," says Mr Gazit."The money was then converted into Bitcoin and used to fund human trafficking.""Money mules" are often recruited to launder this gang cash through their legitimate bank accounts in return for a fee."Estimates suggest that not even 1% of criminal funds flowing through the international financial system is confiscated," says Colin Bell, group head of financial crime risk at HSBC.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The dangerous world of teen "money mules" And the problem seems to be getting worse, despite tightening regulations.In the UK alone, financial crime Suspicious Activity Reports increased by 10% in 2018, according to the National Crime Agency.The US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the BBC it was working on "applied technical enhancements" to its armoury of crime-fighting tools to help it keep up with advances in financial tech, but remains understandably tight-lipped on the details.However, other organisations are openly talking about their use of AI to fight the money launderers.More Technology of Business "AI that applies 'machine learning' can sift through vast quantities of transactions quickly and effectively," explains HSBC's Mr Bell."This could be a vital tool for pinpointing suspicious activity."For this reason, AI is good at spotting smurfing attempts and accounts that are set up remotely by bots rather than humans, for example.And it can also spot suspicious behaviour by corrupt insiders - a key element in many money laundering operations."Using AI removes much of the risk of people deliberately overlooking suspicious activity," says Adam Williamson, head of professional standards at the UK's Association of Accounting Technicians (AAT) - a professional body tasked with helping accountants avoid money laundering.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Several high-profile banks have been caught up in money laundering scandals recently Many of the world's biggest banks have been embroiled in money laundering scandals in recent years.Earlier this year, Swiss banking giant UBS was hit with a 3.7bn (3.2bn) fine after being found guilty of helping wealthy clients in France hide billions of euros from tax authorities and launder the proceeds.It is appealing against the decision.Last year, Dutch bank ING paid out 775 million for failing to stop criminals laundering money through its accounts.And Danske Bank's boss was forced to quit over a 200bn money laundering scandal involving its Estonian branch.In Latvia, too, the country's third largest bank ABLV Bank AS, was wound up after US authorities accused it of large-scale money laundering that had enabled its clients to violate nuclear weapons sanctions against North Korea.AI can crunch mountains of data in real time - emails, phone calls, expense reports - and spot patterns of behaviour humans might not notice across a global banking group.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Crypto-currencies such as Bitcoin have given gangs another way to launder their cash Once the system has learned legitimate behaviour patterns it can then more easily spot dodgy activity and learn from that.Regulators around the world are encouraging the new technology, perhaps in acknowledgement that they are losing the battle.US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) director Kenneth A. Blanco says: "Financial institutions have been improving their ability to identify customers and monitor transactions by experimenting with artificial intelligence and machine learning."FinCEN encourages these and other financial services-related innovations."AI tech firms, such as ThetaRay, LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Refinitiv, are offering businesses tools to tackle money laundering, but there are concerns that this presents its own problems."If organisations are buying AI off the shelf, how can they convince regulators they are in control of it?"asks the AAT's Adam Williamson.And as good as AI might be at spotting anomalies when sifting through huge swathes of data, it is only as effective as the data it is fed.So there is a growing recognition of the need for banks, financial institutions, governments, and law enforcement agencies to share more information."Europol is designed to operate in partnership with law enforcement agencies, governmental departments and other stakeholders," says the agency's deputy executive director Wil van Gemert."We embrace the idea of collective intelligence."Mark Hayward, a member of the UK's new Economic Crime Strategic Board, set up in January, says: "Data sharing is one of our main priorities".And legislation has to keep up with the latest trends in financial services that criminals can exploit.The terrorists behind the 2016 Nice truck attack, for example, paid for the vehicles by pre-paid card to take advantage of the anonymity these cards afford the user.This is why the European Union's fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive introduced last year includes digital currencies and prepaid cards for the first time.Given that the criminals appear to be winning, any tools that can help tackle the problem must surely be welcome.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Why India's rich don't give their money away:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Premji is now one of the world's biggest philanthropists Indian IT billionaire Azim Premji recently became India's top philanthropist, sealing his place among the world's top givers.But his generosity has put philanthropy in the spotlight in a country where charity does not appear to match wealth.The BBC's Aparna Alluri reports.With his recent pledge of $7.5bn, Mr Premji's total philanthropic contribution now stands at some 1.45tn rupees ($21bn; 15.8bn).This puts him in the same league of givers - as philanthropists are called - as Bill and Melinda Gates, and Warren Buffet.What perhaps distinguishes him even more is that, unlike them, he is not one of the world's five richest people - the Bloomberg Billionaires Index ranks him at 51.But the philanthropic world was not surprised at his new status."This is not unusual for him because he's been the largest contributor in India and, even the continent, for some time," says Deval Sanghavi, co-founder of Dasra, a strategic philanthropy firm.It works with some of the biggest donors in India, directing their money to various causes and non-profits.In their universe, Mr Premji is a magnanimous "outlier".The 73-year-old software tycoon has been giving his wealth away for a long time.In 2013, he became the first Indian billionaire to sign the Giving Pledge, an initiative by Mr Gates and Mr Buffet that encourages wealthy individuals to pledge half their fortunes to philanthropy.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption (L-R) Bill Gates, Azim Premji , Melinda Gates and Warren Buffet during a press conference in Delhi He was just 21 when he dropped out of Stanford University to join Wipro, a company his father started in 1945.(He went back and finished school in 2000).Under him, Wipro, a refinery for vegetable oils, grew into one of India's biggest and most successful IT services firms.An intensely private man, Mr Premji rarely speaks in public or to the media.Yet, over the years, his unusually modest lifestyle and his generosity have earned him many admirers.Stories about how he still flies economy, or how he has, on occasion, hopped into a rickshaw, impress many in a country that values frugality, especially among the rich.News of his pledge came in a dry press statement issued by the Azim Premji Foundation and included no personal statement.According to one newspaper, he even asked "what's all the fuss about" when he was told that the pledge was generating headlines and buzz on social media.Mr Premji is not entirely alone in his generosity.IT billionaires Nandan and Rohini Nilekani have pledged 50% of their wealth to philanthropy; Biocon's Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw committed 75% of hers; and many other families fund hospitals, schools, community kitchens, the arts and scientific research.All of them, like Mr Premji, are pledging their personal wealth, largely earned in their own lifetimes.The Tata Trusts, endowed by the personal wealth and profits of one of India's biggest and oldest conglomerates, has been India's biggest philanthropic outfit for decades.It is only now rivalled by Mr Premji's foundation, which funds education, healthcare and independent media among other things."Premji's grant for the nation matches only what Jamsetji Tata and Dorabji Tata have done from a historical perspective," Amit Chandra, managing director, Bain Capital, told the Economic Times newspaper.Mr Premji's contributions over the past decade, he added, stand out across more than a century of Indian philanthropy - the first Tata trust was set up in 1892.Mr Premji accounted for 80% of the money given away by ultra-rich donors in India (anyone who has given more than $1.4m) in the 2018 financial year, according to a recent philanthropy report co-authored by Dasra and Bain.Philanthropy is growing, says Mr Sanghavi, but it's not growing fast enough.Private philanthropy in India grew at a rate of 15% per year between 2014 and 2018.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Premji Foundation works with government schools like these in northern India The Dasra report sees this as "particularly problematic" since ultra-rich households have grown at a rate of 12% over the past five years and are expected to double in both volume and wealth by 2022.Compared to the percentage of net worth given away in the US every year, the report estimates that India's rich could give $5bn to $8bn more each year.What is stopping them?"There is a great fear of the taxman," says Ingrid Srinath, director of the Centre for Social Impact and Philanthropy at Delhi's Ashoka University."They [the rich] don't want to end up on any radar or become the subject of more appeals for money."She believes another reason could be that wealth in India is still only one generation old, and those who have it don't feel secure enough to give it away.But Ms Srinath also cautions against wholly relying on the data as it is incomplete, making it "hard to say anything definitive about philanthropy in India".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption IT billionaire Nandan Nilekani has pledged half of his wealth There is no centralised directory tracking philanthropy in India.Tax laws are complex and there aren't many incentives for giving.So reports, such as the one by Dasra, rely on multiple sources, from the government to third-party trackers to individual declarations.And many people give anonymously, which further complicates estimates of philanthropy."It's not considered cool to talk about how much you are giving," Ms Srinath says.Ashoka University, she adds, was partly funded by some 100 donors, each of whom gave more than $1.4m but refused to be acknowledged publicly.But Anant Bhagwati, one of the authors of the Dasra report, says that no matter how weak the data collection, large pledges are unlikely to fall through the cracks."If you look at those who have the money, they are not giving it," he says.Ms Srinath agrees: "The overwhelming sentiment is that we [Indians] could do better."Charity vs philanthropy Mr Bhagwati doesn't discount donors who fund individual universities or hospitals, but what Indian philanthropy needs, he says, is people who commit to solving a problem.And not just any problem - preferably, one of the daunting sustainable development goals or SDGs.These range from ending poverty and hunger to giving people access to clean energy.Strategic philanthropy - which Dasra advocates - makes a distinction between charity and philanthropy.While the former might involve feeding the poor on a single day, the latter would require investing in non-profits that work to decrease or end hunger altogether.By this measure, rich Indians might be charitable, but not enough of them are philanthropists.Read more stories from India More importantly, Mr Bhagwati says, philanthropy needs donors who will invest in the fight itself.By this he means pledges that don't specify how the money is to be spent.So, for instance, a non-profit that works to improve sanitation could use donor funds to build toilets, hire more people or even buy a laptop or other equipment that might make them more efficient.But most donors, Mr Bhagwati says, will set conditions about how they want the money spent.In other words, they will insist on the toilets being built.He calls this "restricted giving" and says it's hard to coax people to give any other way.But some of this is changing."Earlier you gave as much as you could and hoped something came of it," Ms Srinath says, adding that earlier, most people wanted to fund education."Education is to Indian philanthropy what cricket is to Indian sport," she says, laughing.But now, she adds, Indian philanthropy is finally diversifying into areas beyond education - sanitation, mental health and scientific research.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ms Mazumdar-Shaw has pledged 75% of her wealth for philanthropy The biggest challenge has been the gap between what Mr Sanghavi calls "action and intent".Some billionaires are just more willing to give their wealth away than others.He says he has heard several Indian philanthropists, including the Nilekanis, speak of how they see themselves as "trustees" of their wealth, which, according to them, rightfully belongs to the larger community.That is, they believe they owe the world their wealth.In a note explaining his decision to sign the Giving Pledge, Mr Premji said his mother was the "most significant influence" in his life and that he was also "deeply influenced by Gandhi's notion of holding one's wealth in trusteeship".Ms Srinath says philanthropists could be influenced by many things, from parents to community to faith.But generosity as a trait, she adds, is inexorably linked to a way of seeing the world and your role in it."It certainly has nothing to do with how much money you have."
'A lot of the team started to get ill':::::Image copyright Wahaca Image caption The business partners were introduced by a mutual friend because they both shared a love of Mexican food The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to Thomasina Miers and Mark Selby, founders of Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca.When staff at a number of Wahaca branches started falling ill, Mark Selby says "it was a fairly big shock".This was back in November 2016, when the UK business was hit by an outbreak of norovirus, otherwise known as the vomiting bug."A lot of the team started to get ill, and we didn't understand why," say Mark: "Then suddenly we started hearing from our customers a few days later."In the end 200 members of staff and 160 diners were affected by the virus, and Wahaca had to temporarily close nine of its 25 sites.Image copyright Wahaca Image caption The company has helped boost the popularity of Mexican food in the UK Not wanting employees to be out of pocket, the company continued to pay wages to everyone who was unable to work, even giving them an extra amount to compensate for the tips they were missing out on."It wasn't fair not to pay them," says Mark.Meanwhile, Thomasina sent personal apology notes to customers, embedded with wildflower seeds: "I thought even if they throw it away, they might still get wildflowers growing in their garden."Mark even visited a couple in Edinburgh who were affected by the virus on their wedding day."I had a chat with them for half an hour.I wanted to say 'I'm so sorry'."The co-founders never did find out where the norovirus originated from, but believe it might have come from a supplier."By the time we knew what it was, it had gone through [people's] systems," says Mark: "It came and went in a day, but the lasting effect was much greater."Image copyright Paul Adams Image caption There are now 25 Wahaca branches across the UK Financially the outbreak had a substantial impact on the business, with Wahaca saying it was responsible for a 4.7m loss that financial year, compared with profits of 600,000 for the preceding 12 months.Thankfully, the company was able to recover.Within a few weeks all of the affected restaurants were able to reopen and the business returned to profitability.Today the popular chain has annual revenues of 47.9m.Mark and Thomasina opened their first Wahaca restaurant in London's Covent Garden in 2007.They had been introduced by a mutual friend who knew they both had a passion for Mexican food.Thomasina had not long returned to the UK after spending a year in Mexico.She had gone to the country after winning BBC TV cookery competition Masterchef in 2005.Working in a friend's cocktail bar in Mexico City, she also travelled around the country to study all the regional food specialities.Image caption Thomasina (bottom right) found fame on TV show Masterchef "I'd gone to Mexico when I was 18, and I was obsessed about the food," she enthuses."I didn't have a game plan [on her second visit], but had gone out there on a fact-finding mission.I was driven out of curiosity as to why Mexican food just hadn't got to the UK yet."I wanted to learn more about the food from each region.I thought, 'this is nuts, that's the biggest gastronomical secret in the world... why wasn't it here in the UK?'."While Thomasina had a culinary background, Mark had been working at an investment firm called Capricorn Capital, which had a stake in chicken restaurant chain Nando's.With Capricorn prepared to invest an initial 5m in Wahaca, the business partners had an easier start to their careers as restaurateurs than most.But there were still obstacles to overcome.Image copyright Steven Joyce Image caption Thomasina first fell in love with Mexican food when she went to the country as an 18-year-old "The first day we opened [in Covent Garden], we had to close after half an hour because there was flooding from backed-up drains," recalls Mark.They'd also faced a staff shortage after placing a jobs advert online just 10 days before they opened."People said it would be easy [to find workers] but we had about four people apply, including a Texan who refused to take off his cowboy boots," says Thomasina."I said 'you can't cook in those shoes' and he was like 'I'm not taking them off'.We were like, 'this is harder than we thought'."But despite the initial challenges the company soon expanded, and now has 1,100 employees across 25 locations in the UK.More The Boss features: Capricorn is the majority shareholder, owning 65% of the business.Thomasina and Mark share the remaining 35% with brothers Adam and Sam Kaye, who set up the Ask and Zizzi restaurant chains.While Wahaca remains buoyant, other UK restaurant chains such as Prezzo, Byron, Jamie's Italian, Gourmet Burger Kitchen, and Giraffe, have had to close branches over the past year."Everyone is being hit," says Mark: "Rent, rates, wages and food costs have gone up - no-one could have forecast this.It's a perfect storm."As an example, he says that at Wahaca's central London Soho branch, its annual rent has gone up from 300,000 to 800,000.Image copyright Wahaca Image caption The business partners often travel to Mexico together to explore new food ideas Trish Caddy, senior food industry analyst at research group Mintel, says Wahaca will need to continue to focus on offering both good quality and good value for money, to tempt consumers who are cutting back on going out for meals."Although the ethnic restaurants market will continue to grow, much of that growth will come from businesses driving existing store performances on the back of strong brand management, menu development, and home delivery options."In other words, sit-down restaurant chains have become destination businesses, through offering healthier options, and a higher quality of food and drink and services."Against such a backdrop, there are no ambitious plans to open a Wahaca in every town and city."We're always looking, but we're not up for taking big risks," says Mark: "But we're constantly looking at our food and how to get it better."Thomasina, who also writes cookery books, adds: "What we want in the next 10 years is for people to say should we go for tacos, pizza or a burger in the same sentence."When that's happening, I feel like we've achieved what we wanted to do."
Can Northampton's 'dying' High Street be saved?:::::Image copyright Leon Neal/Getty Image caption About a third of units of Northampton's main thoroughfare are vacant The number of boarded-up shop fronts in towns the length and breadth of England is symbolic of the country's growing High Street crisis.Perhaps nowhere quite encapsulates this as much as Northampton, which in the past five years has lost three major department stores with the future of a fourth uncertain.In recent years countless big name chains like Woolworths, BHS, Toys R Us and Comet have faced the administrators and folded.Others have clung on, saved by rescue deals or by swapping their bricks and mortar businesses for the digital marketplace.That in itself appears to be a Catch-22.Only last month, MPs warned that British High Streets were "in danger of becoming ghost towns" as consumers flock to internet retailers.In towns like Northampton, there has been a slow drip of shop closures.And conspicuous by their absence are the shoppers that once used to crowd into its market square."The place used to be packed," says fruit and veg market trader, Anne Andreoli."It used to be rammed with customers and you'd be serving non-stop, all day."At one stage there was a 100-year waiting list to get a stall.Now you can take your pick.The change has been humongous."Image copyright Photofusion/Getty Image caption There was once a 100-year wait for a market stall in the town The square is one of Britain's largest and dates back to 1235.For centuries it was the centre of the town's bustling market trade."This used to be a good living but I struggle to cover the stall rent now," says Lesley McDonald, who has run an underwear stall for 28 years.She and her husband used to work on it together, but he is now a window cleaner - an income they rely on."There's just no trade.The youngsters shop online and since we lost M&S we've seen a big decline in older customers," she says."I get here at six in the morning and often I've not had a single customer by 10 but I can't just walk away.I keep hoping it will go back to how it was but I don't think it will."Image caption Lesley McDonald fears the town will never go back to its heyday Image caption The old M&S store has been boarded-up since August while the BHS, two doors down, closed in 2016 Marks and Spencer, like many others, was lured away to the 140m Rushden Lakes retail park, which opened 15 miles east of Northampton in 2017.The retailer's move prompted local celebrity and broadcaster the Reverend Richard Coles to describe the town centre as "decaying".On Abington Street - Northampton's main thoroughfare - about a third of units are vacant and many of the entrances now occupied by homeless people in tents.The M&S shop has been empty since August and is now boarded up.BHS, which closed in 2016, has only recently been occupied by a factory outlet store, while House of Fraser closed in 2014.Now, the future of the nearby Debenhams branch is uncertain.It has agreed a 200m refinancing lifeline with lenders but said it would continue with plans to cut the number of its stores.What's happening on the UK High Street?Each year, more shops close than open in the UK and the gap is getting wider.According to figures from PWC and the Local Data Company, 2,692 shops shut in the first half of 2018 - about 14 per day - while 1,569 opened, a net loss of 1,123.That compared with a net loss of 222 in the same six months of 2017.Clothes shops and pubs were the biggest casualties.In January 2008 the internet accounted for 5p in every 1 of retail sales.By August 2018, it was 18p in every pound.In 2018, 43 retailers with multiple stores either closed or went into administration, affecting 2,594 shops and 46,000 jobs according to the Centre for Retail Research.A further 15, with 266 stores and 2,706 employees, did so by the end of February 2019.Life-long resident Jacqueline, 69, says the town's heyday was between the 1960s and 1990s, when the atmosphere was "tremendous".Now she comes into the town centre not to shop, but to drop some paperwork off at the council."The town centre is a mess.Ask anyone born and bred in Northampton and they'll tell you the same."I don't come in very often.Mostly just to catch a bus to the shops in Milton Keynes."Image caption Halymah Agboola says she rarely ventures into Northampton Image caption Jacqueline misses Northampton's "tremendous" atmosphere and shops elsewhere these days Northampton is not only competing with online retailers and Rushden Lakes, but larger towns nearby with a greater selection of shops.Milton Keynes, for example, is a 15-minute train journey away and has a Marks and Spencer, House of Fraser and a John Lewis.You might also be interested in The city with no homeless on its streets The last man standing on the Calf of Man Things Bradford gave the world "Big towns and cities can attract the crowds and be a destination for a day out, while smaller centres [offer] convenience," says Kardi Somerfield, senior marketing lecturer at the University of Northampton."So mid-range towns are particularly and disproportionally affected by store closures."Image copyright Leon Neal/Getty Image caption Northampton is home to about 210,000 people and is an hour north of central London by train Student Halymah Agboola rarely ventures into Northampton's centre."It's probably about once a fortnight to look for clothes.There are much better deals and discounts for students online and it's just less hassle," says the 22-year-old."A lot of students I know are going into the centre regularly to pubs and clubs.But I'm not sure what else would attract young people into town and city centres."Perhaps the answer lies in St Giles Street, which runs adjacent to Abington Street.It features a range of small, independent businesses from barbers to restaurants and - despite a handful of empty units - feels altogether more prosperous.Lisa Witham, 29, runs the Dreams Coffee Lounge with her sister, Nina Neophitou, 25.She says the key to the street's success is simple."There's a lot of lovely independent shops all offering different experiences for customers, rather than the generic High Street shops."The experience for the customer is important.Offer something a bit different that online and out-of-town retailers can't."Image copyright Lisa Witham Image caption Cafe owner Lisa Witham, right, and sister Nina Neophitou, say it is important to focus on customer experience Steve Ward and his wife Caroline run St Giles Cheese, which also sells locally produced gin."Abington Street is just the classic, dying High Street isn't it?You're losing all these big names, one after another," says Steve.Northampton Borough Council has made efforts to revitalise the town centre.According to some, progress has been slow, but a new board has been created to tackle some of the the town's long-standing issues of shop closures and poor footfall.The board, called Northampton Forward and comprising public and private-sector organisations, has already expressed an interest in bidding for a slice of the government's 620m Future High Streets Fund in order to improve areas including the Market Square and a section of Abington Street.And after being awarded 215,000 in central government funding, the council has also created five new positions, including a specialist mental health worker, to help reduce rough sleeping."We know the town has some problems, particularly the centre which is suffering through a combination of factors," says council leader Jonathan Nunn."The primary aim of this new board is to ensure everyone is pulling in the same direction to address those issues and allow the town to live up to its promise."Image caption Efforts have been made to highlight Northampton's arts and heritage offerings A slew of new cafes and restaurants have breathed life into the town centre area and there has been a flurry of regeneration work around the newly designated Cultural Quarter.It is home to the Royal and Derngate Theatre which recently kicked off the UK tour of Kinky Boots - a nod to the town's shoemaking heritage, based on the story of a struggling Northampton shoe factory.Nearby, the town's museum, which is currently closed for a major refurbishment, is due to reopen next year.And the University of Northampton's new 330m campus, which opened in September, brought some 12,000 students and 2,000 staff to the area.Signs of progress mean many businesses are cautiously optimistic about the future, with caveats."There needs to be more support from the council and landlords, making sure we get the right businesses in," says Lisa."There needs to be variety with the retail, with leisure options such as bowling or maybe an arcade.We have students nearby but they need an incentive to come into town."But the more empty units there are, the more difficult it is to attract new businesses.It's easy to get into a downward spiral."
Minimum wage: How high could the lowest salaries go?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK's lowest-paid workers are about to get a pay rise - the result of an increase in the minimum wage on Monday.Since it was introduced in 1999, the minimum wage has risen much faster than average pay.The government is considering what to do after 2020 and further rises are possible.What happens affects everyone from bar staff to waiters to nursery nurses and sales assistants.So, is there a limit to how much they could be paid?And what are the benefits and risks of paying more?How high is the minimum wage?The UK has one of the world's highest minimum wages.For workers aged 25 and over, it is now known as the National Living Wage and rises to 8.21 an hour when they return to work on 1 April.This is 59% of the hourly rate of 14 per hour earned by those on the median (middle) wage.The minimum wage has increased by 50% over the past 20 years, after adjusting for inflation, compared with 15% for those on an average wage.It is now paid to 1.6 million people aged 25 and over, up from only 700,000 in 1999.This is because the minimum wage is now a greater proportion of average pay.Lower minimum wage rates for about 230,000 under-25s range from 4.35 to 7.70 and have not risen as fast.Only four industrialised countries - France, Portugal, New Zealand and Australia - had a higher minimum hourly wage (as a proportion of average salaries) than the UK in 2017, the last year for which figures are available.Some wealthy countries have much lower minimum wages, including the US, Spain and Japan.However, many countries - including Italy and Sweden - are not included because they do not have a minimum wage.Who benefits from a higher minimum wage?The obvious reason for having a higher minimum wage is to boost the pay of those with low hourly pay.In the UK, this often includes cleaners, hairdressers, carers and kitchen assistants.More than six out of 10 people on the minimum wage work part-time.A similar number are women, and almost nine out of 10 work in the private sector.Boosting their wages may also help those on slightly more pay: employers often have to maintain different wages between different jobs.However, while raising the minimum wage is often seen as a way to reduce poverty, it is not that simple.Only one in five of those on the lowest wages lives in the UK's poorest households.This may be because many people on low incomes have a partner who earns more - raising their household income to a higher level.Many of the very poorest people are not affected by the minimum wage.This may be because they are out of work, or because they are self-employed.And on its own, a higher minimum wage will not necessarily lift many people out of poverty.This is particularly true if they have a high cost of living, for example because of having children or high housing costs.More like this What are the risks of a higher minimum wage?Given that minimum wages benefit low-paid workers, why not keep on raising them?First, unless higher wages make workers more productive, they come at a cost.That could mean increasing prices paid by consumers, cutting profits for companies, or cutting wages for other workers.Second, there is a risk that higher minimum wages might lead employers to give fewer people jobs, or to cut hours.But, so far, there is little evidence that higher minimum wages have reduced employment levels.This might be because for many firms it is still profitable to hire these workers, despite paying higher salaries.Minimum wage rates from 1 April National Living Wage - for 25-year-olds and over: 8.21 an hour Minimum wage - 21 to 24-year-olds: 7.70 an hour Minimum wage - 18 to 20-year-olds: 6.15 an hour Minimum wage - 16 to 17-year-olds: 4.35 an hour Apprentice rate: 3.90 an hour The charity the Living Wage Foundation says the wage level needed to "meet the costs of living" is 9 across the UK and 10.55 in London However, at some point, if raised high enough, firms would lose money by employing someone on a high minimum wage.The trouble is that we do not know exactly how high these salaries can go before they lead to a reduction in the number of jobs available.And, with few countries offering higher minimum wages than the UK, it is difficult to look for the answer overseas.For governments wanting to increase wages for those on the lowest pay, the best approach may be to do things bit by bit.Monitoring what happens will be essential to avoid unwanted consequences.About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.Jonathan Cribb is a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which describes itself as an independent research institute that aims to inform public debate on economics.More details about its work can be found here and on Twitter.Edited by Duncan Walker
Life after a devastating mining disaster:::::Image caption "My caf was my dream.I don't know what will happen to it now," says Geruza Frana It was a slow, rainy Saturday summer evening and tourists were beginning to fill up restaurants and cafs in Macacos, a beautiful district in the valleys of Minas Gerais State.Suddenly the evening calm was broken by the spine-chilling announcement from warning sirens."Attention, this is a real emergency.A dam has just broken, evacuate immediately from your homes, follow the exit route to a safe place and wait for further instructions."The whole place went into panic mode as tourists and residents got into their cars and clogged the town's narrow streets.Some left all of their belongings behind.Just two weeks earlier, in neighbouring Brumadinho, an earth embankment tailings dam operated by Brazilian mining giant Vale had broken, killing 308 people.It was the worst industrial disaster in Brazil's history.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tributes to victims of the Brumadinho dam collapse at an iron-ore mine in Minas Gerais state Everyone in Macacos thought the same thing was about to happen.False alarm But it was a false alarm.Vale had detected a problem in the dams and decided to sound the alert, but the dams hadn't actually been breached.Fortunately no lives were lost, but Macacos has still been affected.This had been a paradise-like district for wealthy tourists, with high-end restaurants and elegant hotels.It used to be fully booked all year, but now that everybody is more aware of the tailings dams in the area, nobody wants to come here.Hotel reservations have been cancelled and its most prestigious restaurant has shut down.I visited Macacos just after Carnival week, which is usually the busiest time of the year.Most residents in lower-lying areas have had to abandon their homes.Among the few still left are business owners.But they don't know whether to wait for things to change or restart their lives and businesses elsewhere.Image caption Tourists have stopped coming to Macacos since the Brumadinho disaster "Our economy is over, business owners will not be able to make a living any more.All the peace and quiet we had of waking up in a safe place, is gone," Geruza Frana, who owns Caf Judith, tells me.All her savings from years of working in Europe were put into her caf and properties around Macacos."My caf was my dream.I don't know what will happen to it now.I keep thinking: did I lose my entire dream overnight?It's like someone came and snatched it all away."Leonardo Batista, who runs the Pousada Kumaru hostel, argues that most of the district is on higher ground and would not be affected by any dam break, but he doesn't know whether businesses will be able to convince the tourists to come back.Safety 'revolution' Macacos is one of dozens of districts and towns in Brazil's Minas Gerais state that are feeling the effects of the Brumadinho tragedy.Image caption "Now what Vale?"asks this sign in Macacos In the aftermath of the disaster, mining practices are finally being overhauled.Vale and other firms, alongside local authorities, are working to eliminate the risks of further tragedies by decommissioning 50 tailings dams - draining the water from them.After years of inaction, things are now moving.I recently visited five such dams in Minas Gerais and saw work being done in all but one.But there are economic consequences as well.The work will take three years to finish and mining activity is being severely disrupted, with Vale having to halt production in some mines.Having unsafe mining would be catastrophic; having no mining at all is economically devastating."We don't want Vale to stop mining here but we don't want to be the ones to pay for their problems," says mayor of Itabirito, Alex Salvador.In his town, 65% of its revenues come from Vale operations that have now stopped due to court orders.He is already having to plan cuts in education, health and public cleaning.Image caption Alex Salvador: "We don't want Vale to stop mining here but we don't want to pay for their problems."On top of that there are safety concerns.Should the two dams near Itabirito break, the town would be hit within a few hours.Just a few days after Brumadinho, the town's authorities came up with an evacuation plan.Itabirito now has signs pointing to escape routes and meeting points on high ground.Warning sirens will be installed next month.Global consequences The problems of Minas Gerais and Vale are not just affecting local economies.Global iron ore prices have soared since January, as Vale is the world's number one producer - and Minas Gerais state accounts for 45% of its iron ore output.Iron ore was trading at $74 a tonne before Brumadinho.It reached $95 a tonne immediately afterwards and is now about $85 a tonne.Analysts say prices will remain high for some months, as many questions remain.How much will Vale have to pay in compensation and fines?Will new mining regulations increase production costs?In a few months, these disruptions will start pushing up the costs of steel and construction worldwide.Yet because Vale is such a powerful player in global commodities, it is actually benefiting financially from this supply disruption.Immediately after the disaster it saw some $19bn wiped off its share value.But as no other firm has the capability to take over Vale's market share, the iron ore price rise is now working to its advantage.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mud from the Vale dam collapse - iron ore prices have soared since the disaster Even with drastic production cuts, Vale shares are now at the same level as they were shortly before the tragedy, increasing the anger felt by communities claiming reparation from the firm.Stricter control One thing is virtually unanimous amongst iron ore experts: Brazil needs stricter control of its mining practices, and decommissioning the tailings dams is a matter of urgency.Brazilian authorities are still investigating the causes of the Brumadinho tragedy.Some Vale executives have been arrested and questioned, but no one has yet been charged.Earlier this month Vale's chief executive Fabio Schvartsman stepped down after a disastrous appearance in Congress where he told MPs that "Vale is a Brazilian jewel" and "should not be condemned" for what he described as "an accident".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Vale's Fabio Schvartsman was forced to step down after a disastrous press conference Vale executives declined a BBC request for an interview.In a statement the company said it is "100% focused on supporting those affected and responding to the dam break".Apart from decommissioning mines, Vale has made donations to those affected and organising relocation for those in areas at risk.Back in Macacos, where local business owners are desperately looking for answers from Vale, there is still much anger and little faith in the company.Geruza Frana is now thinking about closing down her caf.What she can't understand is how such a powerful company caused so much destruction in so many people's lives."How can these executives behave like this?I don't think they are made of flesh and blood.I think they are made of iron ore."
Shanghai Fashion Week: UK brands battle for China's growing market:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Models wear designs by Caroline Hu, winner of the Business of Fashion (BoF) China Prize 2019 held during Shanghai Fashion Week Over the next week Shanghai Fashion Week will fill the city with models, designers and buyers.The show is becoming a key route into China but the lucrative market remains difficult to navigate.London-based fashion designer Roksanda Ilincic says she admires the adventurous spirit of her Chinese customers.They're experimental with a taste for clothes that are "vibrant and sculptural yet feminine", she adds."The Chinese market really resonates with those parts of my DNA."For the first time Ms Ilincic is taking part in Shanghai Fashion Week, joining a wave of other foreign brands in search of exposure and crucial business contacts.Observers say Shanghai Fashion Week, which runs until 3 April, buzzes with young talent and commercial potential.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Designer Qiu Shuting (right) dresses a model in her Shuting Qiu collection at the BoF China prize in Shanghai Launched in 2003, it's not one of the top four shows - London, Paris, New York and Milan - but its importance has grown alongside China's economic rise."In Asia, there's an emerging market where lots of the money is spent on Shanghai," says Tianwei Zhang of Women's Wear Daily (WWD) .Many will skip Tokyo's fashion week in favour of Shanghai "because there's more money here", he adds.Last year, a report by consultancy Bain showed that Chinese spending accounted for one-third of the global luxury market - itself worth 260bn euros ($292bn; 223bn).In 2018, the country's luxury goods market posted its second straight year of 20% growth, Bain said.Western brands have long eyed the potential of China's growing middle class, seeking to find their way into the lucrative - but sheltered - market.Securing business partners and buyers is crucial.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A McKinsey-BoF report said China will overtake the US as the world's largest fashion market in 2019 The British Fashion Council (BFC) is one group helping UK designers make inroads in China - from finding a space, to negotiating contracts or licensing arrangements.BFC chief executive Caroline Rush says that while businesses can do it alone "the norm is to go in with a Chinese partner".The group is in Shanghai this week to build its network.It wants to plug into independent retailers across China that reach their customers through social platforms like WeChat and Weibo, and often sell through those channels directly."We're also looking at partners that can help them open retail stores and the big e-commerce players that can help them in terms of mass distribution," Ms Rush says.The BFC is hosting a trade showcase with Roksanda Ilincic and Peter Pilotto in Shanghai, two brands Ms Rush describes as part of London's "new guard".Image copyright British Fashion Council Image caption Vogue China editor in chief Angelica Cheung with fashion investor and chief executive of Yu Holdings Wendy Yu at Shanghai Fashion Week From buyers to fashion writers, industry figures routinely say Chinese consumers are drawn to the "creativity" of British design.Among them is Yvonne Gan, chief executive of The Balancing, a chain of Shanghai boutiques, which sell top names including Britain's Stella McCartney, Victoria Beckham and Anya Hindmarch.Ms Gan says 40% of total investment in the latest collections was spent on British brands.Chinese labels accounted for just 5%: "Local design is not as creative as British designers [and] also quality is not comparable."Still, British firms are competing in a crowded market, trying to please the Chinese consumer - and not all of them get it right.A high-profile stumble from Dolce & Gabbana over an ad campaign widely seen as offensive led to a severe backlash in China with several retailers pulling the firm's products.Meanwhile, Burberry drew some criticism for missing the mark over its latest Chinese New Year campaign.Other British brands have struggled to gain traction in China.Marks & Spencer left the market in 2017, New Look withdrew last year and Topshop has had troubles with local partners.Image copyright British Fashion Council Image caption Yoyo Liu, with designer Roksanda Ilincic, Yvonne Ching, Mia Kong at Shanghai Fashion Week Irene Yu, senior director of merchandising at Chinese accessories retailer Pedder Group says Chinese consumers are "very fashion savvy"."They are sophisticated, well-travelled and demanding in quality and newness."Pricing is also a concern.While wealth is rising, hefty import taxes drive the cost of Western luxury labels beyond the reach of many."British fashion designers are still at a slightly higher price point," WWD's Mr Zhang says.He says while spending power is rising, Chinese consumers are not yet as willing to spend on designer clothes as they are on shoes and accessories.The competitive threat from local talent is also mounting.There are big names like Angel Chen and Shushu/Tong, along with emerging designers like Caroline Hu and 8on8, all set to gain plenty of attention in Shanghai."There are more and more upcoming Chinese designers taking the international stage," says Pedder Group's Ms Yu."They give a fresh perspective."
Should Google, Amazon and Facebook fear this woman?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Presidential hopeful Senator Elizabeth Warren thinks the tech giants have become too powerful US presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren says she'd consider dismantling the tech giants should she ever get the top job.But is this really necessary or even possible?A growing chorus of people think the big beasts of the tech world - Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon - are getting too big for their boots and should be dismantled.But as Prof. Harry First, an expert in competition law at New York University, says: "Breaking up is hard to do", recalling the old Neil Sedaka song.So what should be done?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Is the dominance of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon good or bad for us?Critics say these US-based behemoths dominate the marketplace, use their hugely popular platforms to prioritise their own products and services, and seem perennially able to evade the discipline of most regulators.Concerns are growing that social media platforms such as Facebook and Google-owned YouTube are becoming havens for malicious users spreading illegal, false or terrorist-related content.And the European Union (EU) in particular has criticised big tech firms for not paying enough tax.In March, the EU hit Google with a 1.49bn (1.28bn) fine for blocking rival online search advertisers.It's the third large fine the EU has handed Google in two years.The total bill now stands at more than 9bn.Skip Twitter post by @BBCSimonJack Google now been fined a total of over EUR 9 billion in last 2 years by the European Commission.That's very nearly the UK's annual net EU budget contribution.Simon Jack (@BBCSimonJack) March 20, 2019 Report But, as many point out, even if Google ever pays the bill, it's a relatively small slice of the company's cash reserves, which currently exceed $100bn (76bn).Those who advocate breaking up big companies argue that smaller firms competing with one another on a relatively level playing field will give consumers more choice.Increased competition, the argument goes, also makes firms less inclined to behave badly.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager recently imposed another big fine on Google Take supermarkets as an example.Price competition is fierce, consumers can shop around for good deals, and new players can enter the market - think of Lidl and Aldi when they arrived in the UK.Competition authorities don't like it when big companies merge to the detriment of consumer choice, which is why Sainsbury's and Asda are finding it so hard to get their proposed tie-up past the UK's Competition and Markets Authority.Big tech, however, is a different kettle of fish.Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Sainsbury's Asda merger isn't yet in the bag, but tech firms aren't like supermarkets "As it stands, it is difficult for users to switch between platforms," notes the MIT Digital Currency Initiative and the Center for Civic Media, "and most mega-platforms do not interoperate".In other words, once you've bought into them, you're stuck.And then there's all the data they've collected - gargantuan stores of information about our likes, dislikes, shopping habits, music and entertainment preferences, search habits and so on.It's a hugely valuable resource to which few have access.Some think mega companies become "too big to innovate" and simply snaffle up ground-breaking start-ups."This is why Facebook couldn't invent Instagram - they needed to resort to buying them up," says Prof Howard Yu at IMD Business School in Switzerland.Alphabet - Google's parent company - has bought more than 200 firms, for instance.And Simon Bryant at market research firm Futuresource says he often has conversations with smaller companies who regularly see their ideas repackaged by the giants, who of course already have access to a large consumer base."On the one hand they want to work with them, on the other hand they find it very difficult to compete," he says.Amazon is often cited as the bogeyman of the traditional High Street, responsible for book, fashion and music shop closures.But Sam Dumitriu from The Entrepreneurs Network, a think tank, argues that tech disruptors can shake up established markets to the benefit of consumers.For example, when Amazon bought Whole Foods, the bricks-and-mortar grocery business, retailing giant Walmart was forced to rethink its home delivery strategy as a result - teaming up with Uber, Lyft and Postmates, for example."Suddenly users in the US had better access to home delivery of foods," says Mr Dumitriu: "It benefits consumers."But even if you do think breaking up big tech is the way forward, Prof First says your options are sorely limited.US competition law makes it very hard for courts to find a legal basis on which to justify splitting up a large company, he explains.If there is evidence of bad behaviour then a judge could conceivably make such a demand.But companies can promise to "fix" the bad behaviour and move on.That's more or less what happened 20 years ago, when a US judge ordered that Microsoft be split in two.It never happened.Partly because Microsoft agreed to make changes so that competitors could more easily integrate their software with Windows.Image copyright New York University Image caption Prof Harry First warns that breaking up the tech giants could be harder than Ms Warren thinks "Trying to fix them may be better than not trying, but you can't go into this thinking we have some sort of magic wand," says Prof First.He argues that making the tech giants' data available to competitors might be one way to curb their increasing power.Google's huge map databases could be licensed to other companies seeking to make their own map-based apps, for example.These start-ups might fail, or come up with something significantly better and more innovative, he says.This is a similar approach to that recommended in a recent UK government report on competitiveness in the digital economy.Rather than advocating the break-up of big companies, its author Jason Furman suggests that they be forced to allow consumers to port their personal data to competing firms.Don't like how Facebook is running things?Simply request that your data be ported to your new social network of choice.More Technology of Business And Prof Yu has another idea.In a region like Europe, which is well placed to apply some investigative pressure to foreign companies, why not subject big tech firms to audits of their algorithms, a bit like how banks' accounts are audited regularly?Prof Yu says that there are plenty of capable data scientists in the EU who, were they allowed access, could make sure that big tech wasn't unfairly prioritising its own services within its platforms, or locking away and misusing people's personal data."It's not really breaking them up, you just scrutinise them," he says.So, like a doctor dealing with a nervous patient, the regulator could firmly insist: "Don't worry, it's for your own good."And, indeed, for ours.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Mobile barbering: 'It's like Uber, but for haircuts':::::Image copyright Other For many black British men, barber shops are a place to hang out, chat and meet friends.But for others they waste too much time, which is why two young men have come up with a new approach - a barber shop on wheels that you book via an app.A van painted in bright colours drives slowly down a leafy, residential road in Norwood, south London.A young man in the front garden of a house, clutching a phone, waves at the driver, who parks nearby.They shake hands, then the driver pulls back the sliding door of the van.This reveals a sparkling, silver barber's chair, a large mirror, a hair dryer and pots filled with a variety of scissors.The young man hops in and puts on an apron, syncing his phone to the speakers to get some music playing.The driver - who is now his barber - gets to work with his electric clippers in the tight space.The door is still wide open to let in sunlight.A woman walking her dog along the pavement does a double take, craning her neck back in disbelief."My service is like Deliveroo, or Uber Eats, but instead of delivering food, we deliver haircuts," explains Darren Tenkorang, 24, co-founder of Trim-It.He currently has two vans buzzing around south London and another in the north-west of the city.Darren is confident he's on to something."Male grooming is a super-important part of my culture," he says.But in a van?Yes, he says."My generation really values convenience above all else, you see."Darren grew up in Brixton, south London, where his mother worked as a cleaner and his father as a security guard; they had arrived from Ghana in the 1980s and had dreams of him becoming a banker, lawyer or accountant.University was always part of the plan for him, but when the time came, he wasn't sure which one would feel right.It was a barber shop that helped him decide."It sounds silly, but the fact that there was an Afro-Caribbean black barber immediately when I got out the railway station at Brighton, to visit the University of Sussex, made me think instantly, 'I could be OK here, I could feel at home,'" Darren says.Afro-Caribbean hair is different from European hair and it takes some expertise to cut it well.Darren found he usually got better results with barbers who specialised in it."I actually prefer it if a regular hairdresser admits they don't know how to do my hair," he says."I've had a few bad haircuts when someone is too polite to say 'no', and the results can be terrible."Studying Business Management at Sussex, he got a one-year placement at a re-insurance firm in London - just the kind of thing his parents wanted for him.But while he was there he realised something that made him think hard about his future.He is dyslexic.Initially it was just a hunch, but Darren sought a professional opinion, and the diagnosis was confirmed.When he told his parents, his mother said she'd known since he was at primary school, but hadn't mentioned it."She thought if I knew it might hold me back," says Darren.Darren reassessed his career plans."I became worried about all the big numbers that would be flashing around in the corporate world," he says.So he decided to make his own way as an entrepreneur.Immediately he set up his first venture.It was a digital platform that used an algorithm to match clients' personalities with all kinds of tutoring services - it quickly folded.The following year he entered the StartUp Sussex enterprise competition for student entrepreneurs.He decided to work on an idea he was passionate about: male grooming.Image caption As a teenager Darren got his hair cut in traditional salons like this Afro-Caribbean barber shops are well-known for offering a social, convivial atmosphere - a place to hang out with friends."My dad used to take me to the barber's in the morning and we'd be there for hours," says Darren."We'd watch the football, and he would usually sip a pint of Guinness, chilling with his boys."Darren had enjoyed those times.But as he got older he became increasingly frustrated with the slow tempo of the experience."I got sick of waiting for an hour at the barber, especially on a Friday or Saturday," he says.Or it would be your turn next in the queue, and then the barber would go to eat, or to pick up a child, he remembers.There was a special feeling of community, but perhaps that was more necessary for the generation before his, he wondered."The new generation, like me, just want a trim and to get on with their day," says Darren."We live our life fast-paced."And so the idea came to him of an app that would allow you to book an appointment at a salon for a fixed time with a specific barber.He thought this would appeal to everyone, not just those who use Afro-Caribbean barbers.Indeed some apps were already offering a similar service.He included within his proposal an idea that seemed to him slightly far-fetched.He would eventually like to employ barbers directly, who would drive to clients in a van: mobile barber shops on wheels.Image caption Darren met business partner Nana Darko while at University of Sussex Darren's Trim-It app won the competition, and he was named the University of Sussex's Student Entrepreneur of the Year.The prize was 10,000.To get his company up and running, he recruited a rival from the competition, a fellow student called Nana Darko, whose confident air had impressed him.Darren promised to make Nana rich.He was similar to him, a young black man from south London with dreams of business success.Together they pounded the streets of Brighton, signing up barbers to their new app - all barbers, not just the Afro-Caribbean ones.Through hard work they built the app to the point where it was getting 2,000 bookings a month.But at the same time, the idea and the fledgling business were unravelling, says Darren.There were constant problems with barbers not turning up on time at the salon.Negative customer feedback was building up.They also hadn't figured out how to make any money from the platform.In 2017, Darren left Brighton and took a full-time job with a multinational company that specialises in sports betting, while trying to keep Trim-It going in his spare time.The competition money had dried up and the app seemed ready to die a natural death in the app store."Self-doubt and a bruised ego had become something I was used to dealing with," he admits.Nana too was feeling bitterly disappointed.He had graduated with a first in engineering.But he was missing out at dozens of job interviews in the corporate world and he couldn't figure out why.Was it the way he presented himself, the way he talked, or perhaps the colour of his skin?It was at this low point that Darren and Nana decided to take a risk.They would focus on the side of the business that had at first seemed so implausible and try the idea of mobile barber vans - only this would allow them to control the whole customer experience.Image caption Kris is a full-time barber, operating from the van Through family and friends they were able to raise a five-figure sum in a last-ditch attempt to jump-start the business and in February 2018 the first van was ready - a Ford transit Darren customised outside his parents' house.The back of the van was all stripped out, to turn it into a mini-barber shop, powered by an electric generator.They recruited two full-time barbers, updated the app and waited for the bookings to come in.Very quickly those bookings arrived.In fact by July 2018 the van was permanently fully booked.Skip Twitter post by @bbcstories You can book your next haircut at any time and any place by simply clicking on an app.Watch how Nana and Darren are taking their mobile barber shop around the streets of London.pic.twitter.com/vtgcLUsGTx BBC Stories (@bbcstories) March 29, 2019 Report Word spread partly due to some celebrity customers such as musicians Charlie Sloth and Sneakbo, who both have hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram and Twitter.As Darren and Nana had intended, the kind of people making the bookings were mostly young, black millennials - people like Lewis, from West Norwood."If I was 15 or 16, then I'd go to a barbershop," says Lewis."But I'm 23, managing properties and working part-time, so I don't have time to go to a salon and wait for my turn."He might miss some of the banter in a typical Afro-Caribbean salon, but if he feels like company he can invite friends into the back of the van where there is a small bench for them to sit on, he says.Buoyed by the early interest, Darren was able to sign up more investors, allowing the team to raise a six-figure sum.Around the same time it was becoming clear that there was a shortage of barbers catering to Afro-Caribbean people in parts of London with large numbers of well-paid workers."We're finding that because there is a bigger black middle class and there's more people working in the City, that we have pockets of customers there," Darren says.The van also turned out to be attractive to a new generation of black middle-class professionals looking for a haircut while working in trendy areas such as Old Street, Bethnal Green and Shoreditch.In the first year, about half of the van's business came in this way, says Darren.As of this week, there are three vans in operation.The increasing number of black professionals may mean that the relatively high cost of a Trim-It cut - 25 - is not an obstacle to growth.But there are others.Image copyright Trim-It Image caption The service has also attracted some white and Asian customers One obvious problem is parking.When visiting residential areas, customers often provide tips on where to park, to avoid getting a ticket.It can be easier in the evenings, when parking is free of charge.But to cut hair in working hours in central London, the team has to find a place where they can park for a short period free of charge - no mean feat - or pay for a spot.The difficulty of reaching customers in different parts of the city, bearing in mind London's traffic problems, is expected to reduce if and when more vans come on stream, each serving a smaller area.But there is also the problem of climate change - will young clients continue to feel comfortable having their hair cut in a van that runs on fossil fuels.And of course many people in the black community still feel a strong emotional attachment to the barber shop, which was such an important meeting place for first generation immigrants.Lawrence Agyemang works at a barber shop in Oval, south London, where Darren had his hair cut as a teenager.Image caption Lawrence used to cut Darren's hair when the entrepreneur was a teenager "Young guys still want to hang out here in front of the shop, to show off their new hair styles," he says.And older people come even when they don't really need a haircut, he says, to socialise, watch sport, or just share a joke.Darren says that if his parents, 20 years ago, had thought their son would go into the barber shop business, they would have been "horrified".But if he can overhaul the barbering business, he thinks he might just make them proud."Mobile barbershops will be a thing, trust me," he says.Follow journalist Dougal Shaw on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc You may also be interested in: Gina Atinuke Knight's white mum loved her, but her childhood in a white family meant it took her years to embrace her blackness.Her hair was one of the first things she came to love, which is why she became a hair blogger and wig-maker.Join the conversation -

official figures show that more than 28 million do not - others like Melissa go overseas because their basic cover means that they have to pay a sizeable chunk of any treatment bill.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Costa Rica is not famous for the quality of its healthcare provision She says that her knee operation in Clinica Biblica, Costa Rica's largest private hospital, cost $12,200 (9,200), compared with around $44,000 in the US.Patients Beyond Borders, a publisher of guidebooks for "medical tourists" estimates that more than 20 million people will travel to another country for medical treatment this year, up 25% from 16 million last year.Meanwhile, a 2016 report by payments giant Visa estimated that the medical tourism industry was worth $50bn a year, and continuing to grow.Yet before people in the UK feel relieved about having the National Health Service, with its free at the point of delivery service, more and more Britons are also going abroad for treatment.This is more often so they can avoid waiting lists, get cosmetic surgery that is not covered by the NHS, or for dental work due to a lack of NHS dentists.Medigo, a German-based medical travel company says that queries from UK residents jumped 53% last year.Official figures from the UK's Office of National Statistics also show that a rising number of people are going abroad for treatment.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some UK citizens go abroad for treatment because of NHS waiting lists One British person who recently travelled abroad for surgery was Amanda Wells, from the Scottish town of Dalkeith, near Edinburgh.The 46-year-old travelled to Poland last year - via Medigo - to have a painful bunion removed from her left foot, because she didn't want to wait the nine months that her GP estimated it would take her to get the operation on the NHS.She says she was able to get the work done in Poland for 3,000, half the amount she was quoted by a private surgeon in the UK.Image copyright Amanda Wells Image caption Amanda Wells went to Poland for a foot operation "I did my research regarding waiting times to meet with a [NHS] surgeon, and I discovered that my GP was being optimistic," she says."The facilities were excellent in Poland.The surgeon was fantastic and I saw him for three follow-ups before I went home."Another Briton who went abroad for treatment last year was Lincoln Summers, of Woking, south west of London.He went to a dentist in Hungary."I looked like a mobster after one of my front teeth broke off," says the 54-year-old.Lincoln says he got an implant fitted in Budapest for 800 compared with the 2,500 he was quoted by a private UK dentist."It was not what I expected at all [in Hungary], it was a state-of-the-art dentist," he adds.While both Lincoln, Amanda - and Melissa in the US - say they were very happy with the medical care they received, some experts urge medical tourists to be cautious.Especially if people are travelling to the developing world."People go abroad thinking they are going to get affordable care... and they get back to the States and end up having massive medical bills because they require treatment of infections, and they require additional surgery," says Prof Leigh Turner, from the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota."If they have insurance, their insurance doesn't cover it.It ends being a costly experience."Image copyright Lincoln Summers Image caption Lincoln Summer says he is happy to show off his teeth again Despite this risk, the number of Americans going abroad for medical treatment goes up every year.About 422,000 did so in 2017, according to the US National Travel and Tourism Office.That is up from 295,383 in 2000."The number of uninsured Americans began to climb again in 2017," says Prof Turner."And... it seems plausible that reductions in insurance coverage are pushing more Americans to search elsewhere for affordable medical care."Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: Josef Woodman, chief executive of Patients Without Borders, says that much of the growth in global health tourism is coming from people in the developing world."You have got literally hundreds of millions of people entering the middle class in China, in India, and in Indonesia," he says."The healthcare systems in these countries don't offer them what they need in terms of speciality, complex care."Back in Mississippi, Melissa Moore is continuing to recover from her knee operation in Costa Rica earlier this year.She praises all the staff that treated her."I had a meltdown one day [at the hospital] because of the pain, and the feeling of helplessness," she says."But the nurses and techs were so sweet and helped to calm me."
Can post-industrial towns survive automation?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Some 20 years ago, four million people across the UK worked in manufacturing, but according to the Office for National Statistics that figure has dropped by 30% as new technology replaces jobs.Former coal mining communities, already struggling with high levels of unemployment, have been hardest hit.So much so, that in 2018 think tank the Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) identified 10 former manufacturing towns where social deprivation is already high, and jobs are at risk from automation.The 10 post-industrial towns are Doncaster, Wigan, Blackpool, Mansfield, Barnsley, Bradford, Plymouth, Stoke-on-Trent, Wakefield and Dudley.Patrick Spencer from the CSJ says they need to "cultivate a business community that's going to create jobs locally" in order to survive.BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme reports from two of those towns, Doncaster and Wigan, to find out what they're doing to turn things around.Wigan: The home of Heinz Wigan is a former mining town in Greater Manchester with a borough-wide population of more than 300,000.Image copyright Getty Images/Topical Press Agency Image caption Coal production in the Wigan area was at its peak in the late Victorian era It has a higher-than-average number of people working in factories, is above average for workless households, and lower than average for weekly wages.One of its biggest employers, Heinz, opened its factory in Kitt Green in 1959.Since then the speed with which they can make cans has dramatically increased.New can-filling technology means they can produce around one billion cans every year.John Brockley works in the operations team at the factory.He's been with the company for 36 years, after starting as an apprentice when he was 16.Over that time he says that because of new technology, staff numbers have fallen from 3,000 down to around 800 on site.Heinz dealt with the reduction in its workforce by offering good redundancy packages and reinvesting in the site.Mr Brockley accepts there might come a time when his job is no longer needed.Image copyright Heinz Image caption John Brockley has worked for Heinz his whole adult life Offering good redundancy packages is one way of managing change.Another is to try to attract new businesses into these towns.Wigan's Labour-led council has a policy of supporting new business by making sites available for development.Council leader David Molyneux says it is part of a wider plan that includes attracting younger people to the town."We've got to turn out young people who've got the skills to grasp what the 21st Century has to offer," he says."A lot of people go off to university, but I want to make sure that they come back once they've got the skills we need to see Wigan grow."There are some businesses in Wigan that are looking closely at what opportunities new technology can provide.Keytech, a small IT business, is investing in virtual reality as a training tool.The idea is that they'll manage a system where trainees wear a virtual reality headset to learn how to do a job.David Craig from the company says: "That will service many industries from medical, to logistics to field engineers.There will be investment for engineers to manage the virtual reality technology."Listen to the You and Yours Wigan programme.Doncaster and Amazon Doncaster is a former mining town in South Yorkshire with a population of more than 300,000.Image copyright Getty Images/Bert Hardy Image caption Mining in Doncaster has been replaced by a variety of companies in the services sector and light manufacturing It has three Amazon fulfilment centres employing 1,000 staff, one of which is the size of 15 football pitches.There is also an Amazon Pantry warehouse, one of just a few in the UK that uses robots.Wages start at 9.50 per hour.The robots bring pallets to the staff who pick and pack the items.The robots in Amazon warehouses in a number of locations including Doncaster and Dunstable, are controlled by a computer system, and only specially trained staff are allowed inside the floor where the robots are operating.Jane Colquhoun started as a temporary worker after giving up her job as a cleaner.Now she works with the robots as a fulfilment centre staff member.Image caption Jane Colquhoun started as a temporary worker at Amazon "I've been here since it opened three years ago, when we used to walk around with carts," she says."It was before the robots.We don't have to do as much walking around now."It was scary at first.When you see them you think they're going to hit, but they never have."Mark Hemming, Amazon's regional operations director, says that despite introducing the robots the company is employing more people.He says Amazon has added "thousands of jobs year-on-year, at the same time as bringing in technology that helps our employees".Basic roles still exist, but technology can create new training opportunities and jobs, so it doesn't have to mean fewer staff.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Instead of humans walking miles to pick goods, these robots take the shelves to the pickers Another worker, Richard Cowlishaw-Ellison, who is from a former mining village, got a temporary job at Amazon after taking voluntary redundancy from a law firm."The firm's now gone," he says."It was a really tough decision for me.One Christmas I ended up working nights [at Amazon].Looking back it was the right decision to make, but there were times when I definitely questioned it."Richard, who now has a permanent job as a senior operations manager, adds: "I guess it's the new conversion to what the mining industry was.It was a big employer back then.Amazon is one of the bigger employers in the region now."Listen to the full Amazon report from You and Yours at 12:30 GMT.What's the government doing?The government has acknowledged the threat automation poses in the north of England.To ensure no region is left behind, it is giving 9bn to Local Enterprise Partnerships to create opportunities for businesses and communities across the country.Image copyright HM Government Image caption A number of Enterprise Zones have sprung up, including in Northampton Since 2012, 48 Enterprise Zones have been established across England, generating more than 38,000 jobs and 3.5bn of private sector

Justice has said that businesses should be given financial support to re-skill workers.
How to create a period-friendly workplace:::::Image caption "Menstruation will always exist, so it's better just to know how to deal with it," says Josefin Eklund A football app start-up in Gothenburg is set to become the first business in Sweden to be certified as menstruation-friendly.But how much do employees really want to talk about their periods?Rows of top-division European football kits hang from a giant goal net hooked to the ceiling, while two male developers kick a ball around on a green fake grass carpet.This isn't the most obvious place to be championing a more supportive environment for women during their periods.Indeed, Forza Football's chief executive Patrik Arnesson admits he "didn't think about the menstrual cycle at all" before a female employee asked if the firm could take part in a pilot scheme designed to break down taboos around menstruation."No one had actually told me they had to leave work to go home because of PMS," he says."And then I actually realized that this is a problem and I haven't even reflected on it."PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, is the name for the symptoms some women experience before their period which can include mood swings, feeling anxious or irritable and tiredness.Headaches or cramps ahead of or during menstruation are also common.But each person's symptoms are different and can vary from month to month.The project in Gothenburg is being led by a non-profit called Mensen (Menses) which was given a grant of 530,000 kronor ($58,400; 44,900) from the Swedish government's Gender Equality Agency at the end of last year.Image caption Women are encouraged to tell others if they choose to be away from the office because of PMS Since March it has started inviting all employees to attend discussions and workshops about the effects of menstruation.These will then be used to form the basis for a certification programme that the organisation wants to see rolled out nationwide or even globally.'Something we have to talk about' Klara Rydstrm, who is leading the project for Mensen, says that while Sweden has a global reputation for supporting women's rights, there is still a stigma around discussing menstruation in many workplaces."But it's something we have to talk about, because it's a bodily function - a normal bodily function - just as being thirsty and you have to have water, or you're hungry and you have to have a lunch break," she argues.Forza Football, which currently has around 60 workers and a 70:30 ratio of male and female employees, has already made several key changes - including providing free sanitary products and bins in company toilets Image caption "I realized this is a problem - and I haven't even reflected on it," says Forza's chief executive Patrik Arnesson And flexible working has been introduced for all staff, so they can pick their own office hours or work from home when they want to.Women are actively encouraged to tell other team members if they choose to be away from the office because of PMS and even to share their cycle dates and symptoms with other team members in advance if they feel comfortable with the idea."I get really sad and lose all my self-confidence and self-esteem.It's kind of hard to do meetings where I need to be focused and positive," says software developer and project manager Lisa Hammarstrm.She says she's felt more relaxed talking about her symptoms since Forza Football started taking part in the Mensen project.Colleagues are happy for her to have a lighter workload when she's premenstrual, she says, because she's very productive during the rest of the month.Image caption "It makes things easier for me if people know what is going on," says Lisa Hammarstrm "I realized that it makes things easier for me if people know what is going on and how it affects your work."What do men think?Account manager Manolo Obaya admits that for some male staff, discussing periods in the workplace has been bit "awkward"."When (women are) hormonal, is that a justification for not delivering on work or whatever?It's hard to me to to say because I've never been in that position," he says, adding that he hopes the project will leave him better informed."I think the value is just making everybody aware that some girls suffer more than others and that we should be trying to be understanding of that particular situation."While Forza Football is currently the only company working towards gaining a formal certification, the media buzz around the project has already spurred other businesses to take similar steps.Several Gothenburg start-ups have recently introduced free sanitary protection and painkillers for employees.Image caption "The value is making everybody aware that some girls suffer more than others," says Manolo Obaya In Stockholm, a PR agency A Perfect Day Media grabbed headlines after mulling the idea of giving female staff the chance to enter their cycle dates in a shared spreadsheet.The project didn't get off the ground, but the company says it is looking at other ways to spark more open discussions about menstruation."The most important thing is that women do not feel we must be silent or ashamed about having our period," says the agency's cofounder Amanda Schulman."We are actively working to ensure that women have the same rights as men, [but] this is not what reality looks like for many women who suffer from PMS, PMDD (a more severe form of PMS) or endometriosis.It is an important battle for us."But while there is clearly a strong movement championing menstrual rights in Sweden, there has also been criticism of these kind of initiatives.Ivar Arpi, a columnist for Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet - currently writing a book about gender ideology - argues that suggesting women might need special treatment dredges up old anti-feminist arguments that men and women aren't equal because "female bodies can't be trusted to work properly for the whole month"."Now you get a 'carte blanche' to act bad and you can blame your menstruation.That's really silly," he argues.Image caption "I don't think that my period is my boss's business," says journalist Linda Norlund For other political commentators, including Linda Norlund who writes for tabloid newspaper Expressen, privacy is a key concern."I don't think that my period is my boss's business frankly, and I think that in the workplace it's important to keep a professional atmosphere and not be too personal."Lack of knowledge Josefin Eklund, who works in Forza Football's branding team, argues that even among educated women there can be a "real lack of knowledge" about PMS and PMDD.She herself struggled with severe headaches and fatigue that she didn't initially attribute to her menstrual cycle."I was always taking two days off a month," she explains."I started to schedule or write down how I was feeling to see if I could find a pattern and eventually I did.I could see it was related to my menstruation.""Menstruation will always exist, so it's better just to know how to deal with it instead of pretending that it's not going on."Image caption There is still a stigma around discussing menstruation, says Mensen's Klara Rydstrm Mensen's Klara Rydstrm says she hopes the project will also encourage men to be more open about their health and wellbeing in the workplace too."It opens up (discussions) for other issues as well related to men's bodies or the work environment in general.So I think it's very applicable to everyone."
Extremism is global education fight, says Blair:::::Image copyright PA Extremism should be treated as a global problem like climate change, says Tony Blair, speaking about the role of education in the wake of the Christchurch mosque shootings.The former UK prime minister said there should be an international agreement to put teaching against extremism into education systems around the world.Mr Blair said it could be in the style of the Kyoto Protocol, where countries committed to an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.As signatories to Kyoto have to answer for environmental pollution, Mr Blair wants governments to be accountable for "spiritual or mental pollution" if they allow young people to be taught a "closed-minded view of the world".Beyond borders Speaking at the Global Education and Skills Forum in Dubai this week, Mr Blair discussed how education should respond to last month's attacks on mosques in New Zealand, in which 50 people died.Mr Blair told the international education conference that extremism had to be tackled from an international perspective, rather than in terms of individual countries.Image copyright Reuters Image caption A community march in Christchurch in the wake of the mosque attacks "What happens within a country's borders is not just that country's business," said Mr Blair.He called for education systems to actively promote a "tolerant view of the world"."All countries have to do this because everyone has got problems - there is Islamist extremism, right-wing hate speech, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia."Challenging prejudice needed to begin at an early age, he argued."It's often when children are at their youngest that they need to be given this awareness of the way the world is - and helped to think in a way that is open minded from that young age."Counter-terror spending Mr Blair said many education systems needed "vital reform" because "literally millions" of children were being taught in a way that was narrow and closed.He said ducation should be seen as a "security issue" and urged governments to use a greater share of counter-extremism expenditure to "invest in the future of our education systems and our young people".According to the US-based think tank, the Stimson Centre, the US has spent at least $2.8trn (2.1trn) on counter-terrorism efforts since the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001.But programmes to prevent violent extremism, including through education, make up only 0.1% of global spending on counter-terrorism, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, also based in the US.Mr Blair emphasised that investing in education to prevent extremism should be a priority."You've got to deal with the ideology of extremism and not just the consequences," he said.'Global obligation' Teaching young people about tolerance and tackling prejudices was the "only way" to ensure the next generation will be "free of the ideology of extremism", he said.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Flowers left in a memorial to the victims of the Christchurch shootings He called for schools to teach young people about critical thinking to equip them with the skills to challenge prejudice."Children need to be able to think critically and part of thinking critically is being open to others," he said, speaking at the education conference run by the Varkey Foundation.An international approach would help governments in countries which "face resistance from small-c conservative elements within their system", he said."If I was back in government today, I would be trying to do what we've done with the environment and climate change."Tackling extremism and promoting respect for different views should be seen as a "global obligation", he said.More from Global education The editor of Global education is Sean Coughlan (sean.coughlan@bbc.co.uk).
How a Chinese firm fell victim to intellectual property theft:::::Image caption Frank Liu says his company Intco was the victim of intellectual property theft There was no break in, no hold up.No glass was smashed.But the factory on the outskirts of Shanghai was the scene of a very modern crime.Someone stole a hoard of intellectual property."A couple of years ago one of my IT managers copied ten thousand pages of my entire company's profile," Frank Liu told me.His company Intco has been around for 25 years.He told me the stolen download included "our technology information, our customer list, our purchasing and supply information.Everything."Intco is a business that makes medical devices, skirting boards and photo frames.I visited its offices at a business park in Shanghai, and a factory that sits either side of a tree-lined road south of the city.The company recycles polystyrene waste sent to China from all over the world.Then, using heat moulding and imprinting techniques, it turns it into an array of products which end up on the floors of houses in Brazil or Russia, or hanging on walls displaying photos in the US and Britain."We actually have the record of how he stole it," Mr Liu told me."He just sold it to establish another company, as his investment."Mr Liu feels he has no recourse.He told me he went to the police but nothing happened.He said he still intends to pursue it.His story is increasingly common here, for both local businesses and foreign firms.Top officials from the US and China will hold their next round of trade talks this week and protecting intellectual property (IP) is a key demand for Washington.They argue American and other foreign companies in China have endured decades of theft and infringement.Reacting to pressure China has taken some steps to address the problem.The country only established copyright laws in the 1980s, but things have progressed relatively quickly since then.China now has specialist IP courts, albeit - like every aspect of the judicial system - subservient to the ruling Communist Party.They are supposed to settle cases within 12 to 18 months.Their creation was not due solely to outside pressure from foreign firms.Chinese business figures like Mr Liu have also called for the country's legal system to better protect the innovators and entrepreneurs who have turned China into much more than the "copycat" economy it was once labelled.Benjamin Qiu, an IP lawyer with US law firm Loeb & Loeb, told me that the Chinese are now just as litigious as foreign firms.Foreign firms are just as likely to win a case - a good case, Mr Qiu added - as domestic plaintiffs.In the past few years Lego and New Balance have both won high-profile cases against copycat manufacturers.There is no doubt that the trade war with the US has sped up the pace of reform in China.Image copyright Getty Images President Xi Jinping recently led lawmakers, at their annual gathering in Beijing, in approving new rules for foreign investors.The Foreign Investment Law states that the transfer of technology from foreign investors to any domestic partner must be voluntary.China has always defended this highly contentious practice by insisting it's part of an agreed commercial arrangement.The new law also bars government officials from passing on details of foreign investors IP.A new era?Now though comes the hard part - enforcement.Mr Qiu told me the next step is "detailed regulation coming out after this law, and we want to see actual cases in local courts and also from enforcement agencies."If that follows, then he thinks "potentially the foreign IP owners will have more to protect [them] in China."Both the EU and American Chambers of Commerce welcomed the new law, but both also criticised what they said was ambiguity in the legislation.The Americans also had concerns that it was rushed through without proper consultation.Many foreign companies have been stung over the years in China.Most have found the lure of the massive market, or what was once rock bottom labour costs, irresistible.Some though feel the risk is too high.A fruit industry executive recently told me his firm wanted to buy new conveyor belts for their farms in China, but the European manufacturers said no.They feared their systems would be copied here, and they'd be wiped out.Mr Liu can't do that.He is Chinese and wants to stay in China.But he has taken steps to try to prevent another IP theft.Image caption Production line used to create photo frames at an Intco factory in Shanghai He is chief executive of the company he founded, but this year he told me he's changing his title to include head of research and development.Because he can't trust anyone else with the firms' commercial secrets.Protecting original ideas, techniques and information in China - "it's a human right" he told me.
'The biggest, strangest problem I could find to study':::::Image copyright Andrew Morris Image caption Andrew Morris says about 95% of all background web traffic is malicious Businesses are under siege every second of every day, bombarded by a "grey noise" of potentially harmful web traffic seeking access to their networks.But IT staff often can't tell the malicious traffic from the benign.Why?If your office building were visited thousands of times a day by criminals peering through the windows seeking a way in, you'd be understandably nervous about hanging around.Yet any organisation with an online presence gets exactly this type of unwelcome attention all the time.Security researcher Andrew Morris calls this constant barrage "grey noise" and has started a company of the same name with a mission of logging, analysing and understanding it."This is the biggest, hardest, strangest problem I could find to study," he tells the BBC.He logs the break-in attempts using a network of so-called honey-pot computers scattered around the internet that he has set up.Outwardly these computers resemble run-of-the-mill servers and so attract the attention of the bots and cyber-thieves looking to break in.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Businesses are under siege from a constant barrage of web burglars trying to break in And they attract a lot of attention.In 2018, Mr Morris's network was hit by up to four million attacks a day.His honey-pot computers process between 750 and 2,000 connection requests per second - the exact rate depends on how busy the bad guys are at any given moment.His analysis shows that only a small percentage of the traffic is benign.That fraction comes from search engines indexing websites or organisations such as the Internet Archive scraping sites.Some comes from security companies and other researchers.The rest of the internet's background noise - about 95% - is malicious.It can come from self-propagating computer viruses, known as worms, that use a compromised computer to seek out fresh victims, or can be cyber-criminals looking for servers vulnerable to particular security loopholes.More Technology of Business It can also be dumb devices, from printers to routers, that have been hijacked looking for their kin to enrol them in a vast attack network."There's an absolutely massive amount of traffic that's being generated by all these hosts around the internet and the vast majority is not generated by good guys," says Mr Morris."I see tens of thousands of infections every day."But blocking this tidal wave of troublesome traffic isn't easy.This is because, at first glance, it looks benign.Whenever you access a website your computer first pings a message to it to find out whether it's live.This a standard "handshake" procedure that all legitimate traffic uses.But cyber-thieves have found that if they handshake in the right way they can find out useful information about a target organisation and potentially find a way to get inside.And it's only when anyone takes the time to trace the origin of this traffic that it becomes obvious it is malicious.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Every second of every day business computer networks are under siege "There is a continuous background hum of connections made to systems to see what they are and what they do," says Martin Lee, outreach manager for Cisco's Talos security team in Europe."It's the constant noise of connections just like people rattling door handles and checking locks."Put an unprotected computer on the net and it'll be infected by malware in seconds and possibly enslaved in a botnet army carrying out attacks on other targets."Someone is always trying to hack you," says Mr Lee."It's one of the banal facts of the internet."Given that investigating and blocking is a Herculean task no network administrator wants to take on, the constant rattle is largely ignored, says Dr Paul Vixie, chief executive of Farsight Security and author of some of the net's core addressing software."On the internet, nothing that can be abused will not be," he says.Wading through that vast amount of information makes it very hard for any net administrator to pick out the attacks that matter from the background roar.Instead, they just log it and move on."People do not go into network administration because they like truth and beauty," says Dr Vixie ruefully.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brazil is one of the worst countries for malicious web traffic, says Andrew Morris So Andrew Morris is trying to extract some useful insights from his vast corpus of data, using it to profile bad sources of traffic and spotting patterns in attempted infections.Ultimately it might be used to make a filter that can block the bad stuff.Or one that highlights the really nasty stuff that network administrators do need to notice.He now has a good idea of the dodgiest online neighbourhoods, which seem to be Brazilian and Vietnamese internet service providers (ISPs) who are doing a poor job of protecting their customers.This negligence is allowing the bad guys to get a toehold inside vulnerable machines.These are followed by the cloud-hosting companies.All are strong sources of grey noise, says Mr Morris.Good neighbourhoods are few and far between, though they do exist.One of the most decent is Finland.It has worked hard to ensure that its corner of the net cannot be used as a proxy for attacks.Many cyber-thieves try to cover their tracks by spoofing the origin of the malicious connection request.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Finland has taken great pains to prevent its web addresses from being abused by cyber-criminals Finland has put in place policies, which it polices diligently, to limit the abuse of its domains.A spokesman for Finland's cyber-security centre told the BBC that it has laws and statutes that require ISPs and domain registrars to try as much as possible to limit abuse.It also uses automatic tools that scan for malicious use of Finnish domains - those that end in .fi - and report when the abuse is happening."That is one success factor in making the Finnish internet one of the cleanest ones in the world in terms of malware," he says.Mr Morris' analysis of the traffic coming from the bad neighbourhoods is already starting to reveal interesting and useful patterns.The early signs of massive attacks can be seen long before they start to hit everyone.That has been true of several headline-grabbing events such as those that hit office printers and Google's Chromecast."There's a weaponisation time limit," he says."That's useful to know for defenders to get their stuff patched before they get hit by the bad guys."That means defenders do have time to react - it's not hopeless."Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
'I paid £160 for a pair of limited edition nappies':::::Image copyright Cecilia Leslie / Instagram Think washable nappies, and most of us will envisage a burdensome, time-consuming - not to mention smelly - commitment reserved only for the most dedicated eco-warrior.But, for many a convert, cloth nappies are a hobby, a passion, and even an obsession."Cloth bumming", as it's called in inside circles, is no longer just about the environment or saving money, but also about fashion and the clamour to get the most sought-after designs on your baby's bottom.Some fans collect nappies in the way others amass handbags.Limited editions are snapped up at lightning speed to be posted for resale at nearly 10 times the retail price.Social media communities are flourishing and even have their own lexicon.So what is it about cloth nappies that draws such a cult following?'Not just a frivolous hobby' Image copyright Cecilia Leslie / Instagram Mother-of-four Cecilia Leslie has built up a stash of about 500 nappies.The full-time midwife is now a cloth nappy "influencer" with more than 22,000 Instagram followers.Like the vast majority of "real" nappy users, the 32-year-old from Edinburgh originally set out on her "cloth journey" to reduce plastic waste and save money but, over the years, it became a hobby.Image copyright Cecilia Leslie / Instagram "I fully intended for my use of cloth to be solely functional.But, once I started, it became more of a case of wanting all the pretty patterns.I joined quite a few communities online, where there was a lot of hype about having all the prints."I've got a lot of limited editions, which sell out quickly.It became a bit of a game trying to track them down -

'Muslims don't date, we marry':::::Image copyright Muzmatch Image caption Shahzad Younas came up with the idea for Muzmatch while working in the banking sector The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to Shahzad Younas, founder and chief executive of Muslim dating website and app Muzmatch.When Shahzad Younas took to the stage he was very nervous.It was two years ago, and the then 32-year-old British entrepreneur was in San Francisco pitching London-based Muzmatch to a group of high profile potential investors.He opened his address to the room by saying: "Muslims don't date, we marry."Image copyright Muzmatch Image caption The app is now used in more than 90 countries around the world Shahzad and his business partner Ryan Brodie were there because they had entered a global competition to win backing from prestigious Silicon Valley investment firm Y Combinator.This US company offers financial and practical support to a number of new start-ups per year.More than 13,000 applied at the same time as Muzmatch, and it was one of 800 whose founders were invited to pitch in person.As Shahzad continued his speech, the investors were soon bursting into laughter at how frank he was.Muzmatch was quickly given $1.75m (1.3m), one of 100 start-ups that got backing in 2017.Today the fast-growing company says it currently has more than one million registered users across the UK and some 90 other countries.Rewind to 2013 and it wasn't a group of investors that Shahzad had to convince, it was himself.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Users of Muzmatch can choose for a parent to be able to see their conversations via the app Back then he was working for a bank in the City of London.He enjoyed his job, but at the same time he increasingly realised that there was a gap in the market for a decent dating app aimed at Muslims who were looking for a partner from within their religious community."At the time there were either these really basic websites for Muslims, or big dating apps that didn't quite get our culture," says Shahzad, who was born and bred in Manchester."In the Muslim community a lot of us did, and still do, rely on matchmakers [to find a wife or husband].These are 'aunties' in the community who know families, and who would match up a son with another family's daughter."His idea for Muzmatch was that it would be a digital matchmaker app for Muslims who wanted to find someone to marry.In 2014, Shahzad decided that he had to make a go of the app and quit his job.Image copyright Muzmatch Image caption Business partner Ryan Brodie helped Shahzad redesign the app "I'd wake up at 6am every morning and go to bed at about one or 2am," he says. "I was working from my bedroom at home, and it was intense.I had to learn how to build an app from scratch."But I knew I had to make it work.The opportunity was big enough - there are 1.8 billion Muslims around the world, and clearly no one was serving them."Shahzad did a soft launch of the app in 2015, and his marketing methods were somewhat different to the bigger dating apps."I'd go to big mosques after Friday prayers and hand out cards for the app," he says."Then I'd go to any kind of family Muslim event that I knew was on, and I would literally stick them under windscreens."Watching a business grow on your own can be hard, and at the beginning Shahzad said he found it excruciating.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The app allows users to indicate how religious they are "I remember the first couple of months I would constantly look at Google Analytics, which would show me in real time how many people were on the app," he says.One time he says he checked, and there were just 10 people on Muzmatch.But over time user numbers grew into thousands, thanks mainly to positive word of mouth.Soon people started telling Shahzad how they had met their wives or husbands."Once I heard the first success story it made it feel real," he says."And it cemented in me that the app was going somewhere."More The Boss features: Business partner Ryan, a seasoned app builder despite still being just 25 years old, came on board in 2016.Together they completely redesigned Muzmatch, with feedback from their early customers.They added in 22 more profile questions that people were asking for, such as how religious a person is, and how often they pray - things that really mattered to their users.Muzmatch also allows users to opt out of having a profile photo, or to blur it instead.People can also tick a box whereby transcriptions of their in-app chats are sent to one of their parents, or to another chosen guardian.Shahzad says that while Ryan is not a fellow Muslim, he really "gets what the app is about".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The company now has a second office in Bangladesh, the country with the fourth largest Muslim population Eden Blackman, founder of dating website and app Would Like to Meet, says that Muzmatch has been at the forefront of more specialised dating apps."In recent years ethnic and religious dating has moved from a niche to a mainstream platform, and what Muzmatch is doing leads the pack," he says."If religion and online dating can be matched perfectly... it should be on hallowed ground.From what I have seen and heard about Muzmatch they seem to have broken the mould."Muzmatch, which also has a small team in Bangladesh, operates a "freemium" business model.It is free to use its basic service, but you can pay from 10 a month for extra features such as unlimited viewing of profiles, and having your own profile seen by more people.The company says its annual turnover is now more than 4.5m.As the app continues to grow in popularity, Shahzad says that its potential users are the estimated 400 million single Muslims around the world."We've now had thousands of marriages and babies [thanks to Muzmatch]," he says."Thinking about them every day makes me feel like all that hard work at the beginning was worth it."
Boom or bust: What culture tells us about money:::::Image copyright Getty Images Over the years, one financial crisis after another has ruined - or profited - those caught in the middle of it.The pay and benefits of UK residents is still being affected by the latest crisis of a decade ago.So when has financial advice eased, exacerbated, or even created these downturns?Researchers at the universities of Southampton, Edinburgh, Lancaster and Manchester - funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council - have explored the history of financial advice, and how it is represented in culture.The findings are part of a free, online course.Professor Nicky Marsh, principal investigator on the project, has picked out some examples from art and literature and explains what they tell us.The South Sea Bubble The failure of the South Sea Company was the crisis that shaped our understanding of the dangers of speculative bubbles.Yet many of its satirical representations focus on the deceptions of those involved and speak of a deep mistrust toward the emerging financial profession.Image copyright Lewis Walpole Library, Yale Image caption The Bubblers bubbl'd or the Devil Take the Hindmost 1721 The cartoon The Bubblers bubbl'd or the Devil Take the Hindmost, for example, depicts stockjobbers passing stock certificates that flutter down from above in a crazed dance from which they cannot free themselves, and in which the only option is to try to pass the worthless paper to the greater fool beside them.Investors in the 1720s relied on stockjobbers, rumours and friends and relatives for their financial advice.Fraud and imperial fantasies Even when the genre of financial advice had appeared, in newspaper columns and guidebooks, it was not always trustworthy.The financial boom of the 1820s provided investors with a dizzying range of new investments, especially those with an appetite for imperial adventures.The financial advice manuals that now did exist conservatively warned against these investments so new writers filled the gap.A speculative genre of financial advice emerged, one that talked up the untold wealth to be made from new discoveries, innovations, and technologies.One of the most notorious examples was Thomas Strangeways' 1822 Sketch of the Mosquito Shore.Image copyright Archive.org Image caption The Sketch of the Mosquito Shore including the Territory of Poyais by Thomas Strangeways The book was authored by the soldier and adventurer Gregor MacGregor but its glowing account of the resources and climate of the new nation of Poyais was entirely fraudulent.It was targeted chiefly at the settlers he hoped to lure to his utopia, but the book underpinned MacGregor's efforts to float a Poyais loan on the London market and he raised over 50,000 before the scam was exposed.The Brontes and railway mania Britain went mad for railway shares in the 1840s.In their Haworth parsonage, the Bronte sisters - Charlotte, Emily, and Anne - inherited shares in the York and North Midland Railway.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Charlotte Bronte wrote Jane Eyre Charlotte's letters reveal how the sisters navigated the market.Emily took charge of their investments, "carefully reading every paragraph and every advertisement in the newspapers that related to rail-roads".But the press, full of hype for the railways, did not give the best advice.Charlotte wanted to sell out before it was too late, but could not persuade "headstrong" Emily, and eventually gave way.Her concerns were vindicated when the market collapsed.Charlotte learnt from the mistake.She took the advice of her publisher in 1849 and invested the royalties from her novel Shirley in Consols (perpetual government bonds).A self-fulfilling prophecy Thomas Lawson (1857-1925) was at one point the sixth richest man in America.He made his fortune as a stock promoter, organising large corporate mergers.However, he was soon sick of what he saw as the corrupt stranglehold that a clique of big businessmen had on the American economy.Image copyright History of Financial Advice Image caption Cover of Thomas Lawson's Frenzied Finance (1906) Instead he turned to muckraking journalism, and in 1906 published Frenzied Finance.It was a searing expos of the scandal surrounding the Amalgamated Copper deal.He soon realised that journalism does not pay as well as finance, so he returned to stock promotion.This time he tried to move the market not by insider dealing or an advice manual, but by writing a sensationalist novel, Friday the Thirteenth (1907).It predicted an apocalyptic crash of the stock market.His avid readers took his warnings at face value, and ended up creating the real world the financial panic that the fiction had imagined - and Lawson pocketed the profit.The Wall Street Crash At the opening of F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby (1925), the narrator, Nick Carraway, recalls buying "a dozen volumes on banking and credit and investment securities".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Robert Redford in a scene from the film The Great Gatsby In the 1920s, many Americans likewise devoured guides to Wall Street speculation in the hope of following in the footsteps of the legendary financier J.P. Morgan, and came to regret it when prices on the New York Stock Exchange collapsed in the Great Crash of 1929 and they lost anything they had invested.Fitzgerald would go on to write the definitive post-crash story, Babylon Revisited, in 1931.The "luck in the market" enjoyed by the protagonist in the 1920s boom allows him to live as "a sort of royalty, almost infallible, with a sort of magic around [him]", until the market cleans him out.Fitzgerald's protagonist ultimately suffers a breakdown - a fate sadly shared by the author himself and his wife Zelda in the depression years that followed what the author called "the most expensive orgy in history".The apocalyptic 1970s As inflation steadily rose throughout the 1970s, financial advice often took a decidedly apocalyptic turn.Howard Ruff's How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years recommended buying gold, food and guns.Image copyright History of Financial Advice Image caption How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years was published in 1979 The relationship between financial advice and disaster fiction also began to blur in this moment.Paul Erdman's The Billion Dollar Sure Thing, which turned President Nixon's recent closing of the gold window into a cold war thriller, was taken up by influential economists for offering the best explanation of how money worked in the new economy emerging from the 1970s.Reading the charts The stock price chart - with its upward and downward lines forming peaks and troughs that resemble the profile of a mountain range - is one of the most familiar ways of visualising the financial markets.Many investment advice authors believe that the movements of prices reflect underlying natural laws and form recurring patterns that can be "charted" and exploited for profit.Image copyright Matthew Cornford and David Cross Image caption Black Narcissus by Matthew Cornford and David Cross In their digital work Black Narcissus (2014), the British artists Matthew Cornford and David Cross track along a computer-generated mountain skyline mapped onto the historical undulations of the stock market in the period 2003-2013.In this still from the work, the downward trend on the left, culminating in the vertiginous drop in the centre, corresponds to the global financial crisis of 2008.Here, the market quite literally falls off a cliff edge - one that very few people saw coming.
How do you know where your olive oil really comes from?:::::Image copyright oracle Image caption How do you know your extra virgin hasn't been mixed with inferior oils?When you pick up a bottle of extra virgin olive oil from the supermarket shelf, how confident are you that it's all that it seems?The olives have had a long journey: from the tree to the mill, where the oil is extracted, which then goes on to the bottling plant before distribution over land and sea to reach the store.Unfortunately, at any of these stages, it's possible for fakery to creep in."Fraud in the olive oil market has been going on a very long time," says Susan Testa, director of culinary innovation at Italian olive oil producer Bellucci."Seed oil is added maybe; or it may contain only a small percentage of Italian oil and have oil from other countries added, while it just says Italian oil on the label."In February the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) warned that poor olive harvests are likely to lead to a big increase in such adulterated oil this year.And it's far from the only product affected, with the European Union's Knowledge Centre for Food Fraud and Quality recently highlighting wine, honey, fish, dairy products, meat and poultry as being frequently faked.Moreover, 40% of food companies believe traditional methods of countering food fraud aren't working any more, according to research from PwC.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption From tree to supermarket shelf, the olive goes through many stages and many countries Food suppliers, like Bellucci are making efforts to guarantee the provenance of their food themselves, using new tools such as blockchain technology.Best-known for its role in crypto-currencies like Bitcoin, blockchain is a way of keeping records in which each block of data is time-stamped and linked irreversibly to the last, in a way that can't be subsequently altered.That makes it possible to keep a secure record of the product's journey to the supermarket shelf.Since the company was founded in 2013, Bellucci has aimed to build a reputation around the traceability of its oil.Customers can enter the lot number of a particular bottle into an app to see its precise provenance, right back to the groves where the olives were harvested.Image copyright Oracle Image caption Andrea Biagianti from Bellucci says blockchain paves the way for more information to be shared And over the last year, Bellucci has introduced a blockchain-based system, created by Oracle, to underpin this traceability which it says will make the process more efficient."We expect an improvement in the exchange of information throughout the supply chain," says Andrea Biagianti, chief information officer for Certified Origins, Bellucci's parent company."We would also like the ability [to have] more transparency in the supply chain and the genuine trust of consumers."IBM's Food Trust network, formally launched late last year, uses similar techniques."In the registration phase, you define the product and its properties - for example, the optical spectrum you see when you look at a bottle of whisky," explains Andreas Kind, head of blockchain at IBM Research.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Blockchain tech aims to make it much more difficult to interfere with bottles' contents The appearance of the whisky is precisely recorded within the blockchain, meaning that the description can't later be altered.Then transport companies, border control, storage providers or retailers, can see if the look of the liquid no longer matches the description or "optical signature".Meanwhile, labels holding tamper-proof "cryptoanchors" are fixed to the bottles.These contain tiny computers holding the product data - encrypted, or encoded, so it can't be tampered with.The labels break when the bottle is opened.Linking the packaging and the product in this way offers a kind of proof says Mr Kind, "a bit like when you buy a diamond and get a certificate."IBM is also working with US supermarket chain Walmart, which is rolling out a blockchain-based system that will require all its leafy greens suppliers, along with packing companies and transport operators, to take part.Image copyright Alibaba Image caption Alibaba's online retail site, Tmall Global, uses blockchain tech to help consumers check product authenticity Meanwhile, Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba uses blockchain to track food products shipped from Australia and New Zealand; suppliers like New Zealand's largest dairy firm, Fonterra, have adopted the technology.But they go one step further."In addition to blockchain technology, the framework will also tag products using QR codes to authenticate, verify, record and provide ongoing reporting throughout the product's lifecycle," says Fonterra president for greater China, Christina Zhu.One product Fonterra provides detailed information for is its Anmum infant nutrition range, including the results of factory inspections and product quality sampling tests.But it's not only in the area of tracking supply chains that technology is providing new avenues to approach food fraud.In recent years, there has been progress in identifying food fraud through closer examination of the product itself using DNA analysis.But this approach has one big limitation: to detect an unauthorised ingredient, you have to know what you're looking for.So it's possible to test whether, say, a beef lasagne contains horsemeat, but not to scan a product for unauthorised ingredients without any idea in advance of what it might contain.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Back in 2013 traces of horsemeat were found in ready meals labelled as beef Now, though, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) has developed a new scanning tool that can identify all the ingredients in a product, along with their biological sources.It uses Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) - a large-scale testing method that allows whole genomes to be sequenced rapidly.The FSAI has tested the scanner on 45 random samples and found that four contained plant species that weren't listed on the label.More Technology of Business One of them was mustard - a known allergen that should always be declared."We don't have to wait for tip-offs any more," says Dr Patrick O'Mahoney, chief specialist, food science and technology at the FSIA.Nevertheless he cautions against interpreting the results too literally."As regulators, we have to be pragmatic about what could be a labelling error rather than food fraud," he says."We go for the ones where there's an obvious financial benefit for somebody."Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
How a bookshop wolf handles awkward customers:::::Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne Barnetson uses humour to show how to defuse situations that can make people feel bad We've all heard of the saying "the customer is always right" but when you work in service industries, what can you do to vent your frustration when the customer is rather annoying?Whether it's children running riot, requests for the most obscure information, or just plain rude customers, Australian bookshop worker Anne Barnetson has faced it all.But she's come up with a rather novel way of dealing with such awkward situations.Anne is the creator of Customer Service Wolf, a comic found on Instagram and Tumblr.It gives a humorous anthropomorphic take on life dealing with strangers turning up in bookshops with strange requests.Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption The wolf is supposed to represent the "everyman" and show a whole range of experiences felt by those in customer service The images can have a bite to them.Some show the wolf getting so frustrated with unfair demands and indecision that it ends up bounding over the counter and eating the customers, who tend to be rabbits, birds and other prey."It's unenacted fantasies that I think people have after a very long day when they think: 'It would just be great to stop all this right now,'" laughs Anne, who lives and works in Perth, Western Australia.She is, however, keen to stress that she's a lot more polite in real life and the interactions shown are very much exaggerated.This is a bit of a relief as one of the more icky comics shows a creature seeking a (made up as far as we can tell) book called Chicken Soup for the Soul: Urine Therapy for Tweens, second edition.The wolf worker's reaction is one of sheer unadulterated horror.Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne says she would probably recommend barbecue recipe books to any wolves that turned up in the bookshops she works in Anne says: "The idea came about when I was working at a bookstore with a good friend and we had nicknames for each other.I was 'Flying Wolf' and she was 'Black Wolf'.She said: 'Wouldn't it be funny if savage predators worked in retail and they could just eat the customers that really irritated them?'"Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption The first comic was created for Anne's friend as a gift She drew the first strip for her friend in 2012 - an interaction between a wolf worker and an indecisive rabbit - but soon realised that she had a whole hoard of experiences to unleash upon the world.Anne says it's far safer to draw the characters as animals."It gave me free rein to be as humorous and rude as I liked about the interactions I've had with my customers.I'd hate to actually upset anyone."Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption The comments on the comic strip tend to reflect similar experiences other workers have had However, she does have friends and colleagues who turn up in the comics."Dr Fox is always happy when he sees himself.Manager Wolf is another repeat character.You can pick him out because he wears a tie, which my boss used to find hilarious.He didn't wear a tie, but still it's about representing middle management."Anne hasn't revealed which bookshops she works in, although she is now starting to get recognition because of the comic strip."Thank goodness no-one has pointed out themselves and said: 'Oh, I'm going to sue for defamation or anything,'" she says.People who comment on her strips often share their own experiences."On my first shift in a bookstore, a lady asked for an orange book but she couldn't remember the title.Or summary.Just 'big orange book'," says one fellow bookshop worker."My favourite record store repeat request.'You know that love song they're always playing on the radio.You must know it.They play it all the time,'" another reader comments.Image copyright Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com Image caption Anne, a professional illustrator, hopes the comic strip will eventually lead to a book deal But what does Anne personally do when dealing with difficult customers, apart from store up the experiences to use as inspiration for the comics?"I've found that if you're in customer service, people can be a little condescending or just assume you don't have feelings or will be very impatient.The ones that still make me feel horrible when I think about them are those where I've been properly yelled at, usually by a man."I am definitely not as quick as the wolf.I stumble, get quite awkward, and then fume about it for hours, days and weeks afterwards."That's what's so nice about living out the fantasy in the wolf comics - they are completely instinctual, specialised animals that are quick to act and they don't think about it."But of course, being human is much more awkward, complicated and difficult."All images courtesy of Anne Barnetson/CustomerServiceWolf.com
Chinese imports 'driving fishermen to despair':::::Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Kenya's fishermen are increasingly struggling to make a living As the frozen fish defrosts under the hot Kenyan sun, fishmonger Mechak Juma prefers not to tell his customers that it has come all the way from China.We are at the largest fish market in the city of Kisumu, on the eastern shores of Lake Victoria, Africa's largest lake.A scene of hustle and bustle, business is booming for the traders, but very little of that money now goes to the local fishermen.As fish stocks in Lake Victoria have plunged over the past two decades, and prices have risen sharply as a result, cheap farmed Chinese imports are increasingly filling the gap."People don't want to buy Chinese fish because they don't trust the [farmed] production process, but we don't have much of a choice," says Mechak, standing next to a big wicker basket of whole Chinese tilapia fish.The trampled cardboard boxes used to ship the frozen fish 8,000 km (5,000 miles) are stashed away in a corner, and the fish itself is more than two years old.It will expire in less than a month, according to the dates on the boxes.Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Chinese fish farms are able to operate very cheaply by using rice industry waste as food "People prefer to buy local fish, but we earn nothing on local fish now," says the 29-year-old."Only by selling Chinese fish am I able to earn enough money to feed my family."Fish catches from Lake Victoria have plummeted by more than half over the past two decades, due to overfishing and pollution.Over the same period Kenya's population has doubled.Vast stretches of water hyacinths, an invasive weed, along the shorelines, have also caused severe problems for the country's fishermen.The thick, interwoven carpet of the plants means that smaller boats can struggle to get out to clear water.Kenya's Lake Victoria fishermen now bring in an estimated 140,000 tonnes of fish per year, little more than a quarter of the 500,000 required.Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Kenya's fisherman sometimes cannot sell all their catch Chinese companies and their Kenyan partners seized the opportunity, and are now said to be exporting more than $17m (13m) of fish to Kenya annually, more than double the amount three years ago.It was an easy gap for the Chinese to fill, because the freshwater fish that they farm on a vast scale - tilapia - is from the same broad species that Kenyans mostly catch in Lake Victoria.So for Kenyan consumers the fish look and taste very similar.The Chinese fish is just considerably cheaper, selling for as little as $1.70 per kg, compared with about $5 per kg for the local catch.For Kenyan fisherman Frederike Otieno, it is a hopeless situation."While we spend many nights on the lake and lose a lot of money on fuel, we have to compete with this cheap Chinese farmed fish that floods the market," says the 36-year-old.Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Kenya's fishmongers are often reluctant to admit that their fish is Chinese The father of three says that sometimes he cannot sell all his catch.A fisherman for 10 years, he says he used to earn about 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($30; 23) per day, but that has now fallen to little more than 400 shillings.In November last year, the Kenyan government moved to try to protect the Lake Victoria fishing industry by imposing an import ban on foreign tilapia.But the restrictions were lifted in January after China's ambassador to Kenya, Li Xuhang, referred to the ban as a "trade war".It was also reported that China had threatened to freeze funding for a new railway line connecting Kenya with Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.However, the official explanation from Kenya's Department for Fisheries for the U-turn was that "a huge shipment of [Chinese] fish was held up at the port of Mombasa, negatively impacting local supplies".Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Not all the frozen Chinese fish on sale in Kenya is within its best before date What Kenyan authorities are continuing with is efforts to improve fish stocks in the lake, for example, by arresting fishermen who fish too close to the breeding areas near the shores to save on time and fuel.But this deterrent continues to increase prices in the short term, as fisherman have to travel further out into the lake.The biggest importer of Chinese fish in Kenya is a company called East African Sea Food.Its director, John Musafari, says that while the farmed Chinese tilapia is high quality, the low prices are possible because the fish is fed on rice bran, which is cheap and plentiful.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: This bran is the hard outer layer of each rice grain, which is removed in China before the rice is sold to consumers.Mr Musafari adds that fish farming has not taken off in Kenya because fish feed "is extremely expensive" in the country, due to it currently being made from maize, which is also the country's staple food.He wants to see more investment in the development of cheaper fish feed in Kenya."That could really boost the country's aquaculture," he says.Image copyright Jeroen van Loon Image caption Some say that the long-term future of fishing on Lake Victoria is in doubt Others in Kenya are very happy with the growing reliance on Chinese fish imports, such as Simon who helps to transport the boxes across the country."Thanks to this Chinese tilapia, poor people can now eat nutritious protein-rich fish as well," says Simon, who declined to give his full name.He now makes $300 a day, which for many Kenyans is more than their monthly salary.Yet for Edward Oremo, a Kenyan fisheries official, it will ultimately mean the end of commercial fishing on Lake Victoria."As long as Chinese imports continue... fishermen will be driven to despair, and Lake Victoria will be empty [of fishing boats] in less than 50 years."All pictures copyright Jeroen van Loon.
'Corruption in Ukraine has to be stopped':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Cranes stand idle at Mariupol on the Azov Sea The port of Mariupol in eastern Ukraine has become a symbol in recent months of the country's economic struggles.A recent partial blockade by Russian naval vessels of the nearby Kerch Strait means that fewer ships are now docking at the harbour.The port has lost 33% of its fleet and up to 140,000 tonnes of exported metal products a month since Russia's construction of a bridge across the Kerch Strait in May 2018, and restrictions on the size of ships that can pass underneath.Cargo vessels are being delayed by up to a week, and the cranes on the dock stand idle.Larger international shipping firms have simply stopped coming.Hundreds of jobs depend on the work here - Mariupol is Ukraine's second port - and many tens of thousands more depend on the export of goods it allows.Image caption Mariupol needs the blockade to be lifted, says Galina Balobanova "Big business feels it and we all feel it too because prices are rising," says Galina Balobanova, a local businesswoman."A lot of people work in the port and they're not being laid off, but for them it's an unexpected vacation.We need this trade and for the blockade to be lifted."Yet it's not just the relationship with Russia that is the problem for firms in Mariupol.Another businessman, who doesn't want to be named, meets me in a local bar and puts it bluntly: "The Russians are a big problem - but the corruption here is the single biggest thing strangling our trade."Money for much-needed dredging of the harbour has simply gone missing, he tells me, presumed stolen by officials, and this has placed big limits on the types of ships reaching the dock.Image caption The recent defence procurement scandal in Ukraine has angered many in the country The way that corruption impedes business in Ukraine is varied and has been widely studied.In the past ordinary citizens would often have to pay a bribe just for simple procedures such as a visit to a doctor, obtaining a passport or driving licence.Much of this has now improved, though, thanks to a system called PreZorro that bypasses human officials and allows digital processing of applications and tenders."The last five years the pace of reforms is amazing," says Olesia Verchenko, academic director at the Kyiv School of Economics."If you look at the price of drugs, for example, in hospitals you sometimes have a tenfold decrease in the health ministry's costs [as a result of the reforms]."These changes mean that regular small and medium-sized businesses in Ukraine may not see corruption firsthand.But experts say it is still a problem at the highest level, in the courts and among the political class.Image caption An anti-corruption slogan: Transparency International's 2018 corruption perception index ranks Ukraine as 120th out of 180 countries "They stole money from our army, they stole the lives of our soldiers," says Vyacheslav, a protester I meet at a noisy demonstration in Independence Square in Kiev.The charges he refers to are recently revealed documents implicating senior members of Petro Poroshenko's government in a defence procurement scam worth some $10m (8m).Smuggled Russian munitions and other weaponry were allegedly sold to the Ukrainian military at wildly inflated prices.The two senior officials have been suspended by the president pending an investigation."They were so confident they wouldn't get caught, they filtered the money through their own companies," says Sergey Leshchenko, an MP and former investigative journalist.President Poroshenko has not been directly accused of any wrongdoing himself.But one of those firms was one formally owned by the president."It's impossible he couldn't have known," Mr Leshchenko adds.Image caption "Fixing corruption in this country is Ukraine's number one problem, it has to be stopped," says MP Sergey Leshchenko The IMF has made accountability and transparency a condition of recent bailouts in Ukraine, but even it admits that those accused of corrupt practices are rarely seriously punished.In what's been seen as a backwards step, just two days after the defence scandal broke, the constitutional court ruled that those accused of corruption no longer have to provide evidence in court on how they came by their wealth.For Mr Leshchenko this scandal has been the last straw.He has withdrawn his support for President Poroshenko and is not backing any of the other established parliamentary candidates in this month's presidential election either, saying the entire political elite is compromised."Fixing corruption in this country is Ukraine's number one problem, it has to be stopped," he says."It's in the interests of Europe and the whole world and that's why I urge friends abroad not to back Ukraine's corrupt leadership but to protect anti-corruption institutions - and free and fair elections."
Jim Ratcliffe: Turning cast-offs into gold:::::Image copyright Getty Images The UK's richest man Jim Ratcliffe is the proud new owner of a high-profile professional cycling team, after his firm Ineos took over the former Team Sky.The team will change its name to become known as Team Ineos mid-season, racing under its new name for the first time at the Tour de Yorkshire at the beginning of May.The British-registered outfit had been seeking new funding after Sky said in December that it would end its ownership and sponsorship at the end of this year.In many ways it is a familiar modus operandi for the man once called Dr No by trade unions for his tough negotiating stance.Through buying up and turning around cast-off parts of other businesses, the Mancunian has made a 21bn fortune.Private equity From operations once owned by the likes of oil giant BP, Mr Ratcliffe has created a company whose chemicals and raw materials go into nearly everything we touch every day.And it only took him 20 years to do it.Mr Ratcliffe, 66, has always been involved in chemicals and industry.After graduating with a degree in chemical engineering from the University of Birmingham in 1974, he spent a very brief spell at BP before jumping to rival oil business Esso as a trainee accountant.Armed with an MBA from the London Business School, Mr Ratcliffe moved to fabric and chemicals producer Courtaulds before a career-changing step into the world of private equity when he joined Advent International in 1989.Art of the deal Advent served as a platform for Mr Ratcliffe to learn the cut and thrust of doing deals.But after just three years, he was already making a leap into co-owning a business based on what would become a well-worn strategy.He and fellow businessman John Hollowood decided to buy BP's chemicals division in Hythe, Kent for 40m in 1992.By 1994, it was valued at 100m when it floated on the London Stock Exchange.It was a high-risk move, Mr Ratcliffe admitted."I started the business in the days when you had to put all your worldly goods on the table," he told the London Business School in an interview."I had to put 100% of the equity that I owned at that stage on the line, so that was the house, savings and even the wife and children, which makes you very focused."The business, Inspec, went on to acquire BP's speciality chemicals business in Antwerp, Belgium.Mr Ratcliffe left Inspec to form his own firm, Ineos, in 1998 which bought the Belgian business for 89m.Ineos is now worth 35bn, according to The Sunday Times Rich List - based on Mr Ratcliffe's strategy of buying "unfashionable or unsexy facilities owned by large corporations where you'd know they would be sloppy with the fixed costs".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ineos reversed a plan to close its Grangemouth plant in 2013 From 181 sites across 22 countries, Ineos generates sales of around 45bn and employs 18,500 people.Its raw materials are used in everything from packaging for toiletries, medicines and food, to mobile phones and furniture.Because of his decision never to float the company and thus have no City shareholders to consult, Mr Ratcliffe, who owns 60% of Ineos, has been able to move quickly on deals.In its first 10 years, Ineos bought more than 20 operations from huge companies such as German chemicals maker BASF, Dow Chemical of the US and ICI, once the biggest manufacturer in the UK.Quadrupled sales Arguably, the most important of these deals was Ineos's 5bn takeover of Innovene, BP's petrochemical business, in 2005.Overnight, it quadrupled Ineos's sales to more than 18bn and doubled its staff numbers to 15,000.Innovene also included the Grangemouth petrochemical plant and refinery in Scotland which, in 2013, became the scene of a tense stand-off with trade unions threatening strike action over pay and pensions.The dispute - which earned Mr Ratcliffe the Bond villain moniker of Dr No - led to Ineos announcing that it would close the petrochemical plant and cut 800 jobs.Shortly afterwards, Ineos reversed its decision when the Unite union agreed to a survival plan to invest 300m in the plant to keep it open.Ineos continues to expand either through acquisitions such as buying the Forties Pipeline System from BP, which delivers 40% of the UK's North Sea oil and gas or through investment into controversial areas such as fracking.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ineos bought the motorcycle wear maker Belstaff Ineos has pledged to invest 650m in fracking and in 2016 created much fanfare around the arrival of the first shipment of shale gas from the US to arrive in the UK.The company is locked in a legal battle with the Scottish government over its moratorium on fracking.Meanwhile, Mr Ratcliffe took a surprising step away from chemicals when he announced plans to invest 600m to build a new vehicle based on the Land Rover Defender, which was discontinued in 2016.Ineos then bought Belstaff, the luxury motorcycle wear maker whose jackets were once worn by actor Steve McQueen and modelled by the likes of David Beckham.The company then acquired the Swiss football team FC Lausanne-Sport.Whether or not these businesses could be classed as unloved is not certain, but Mr Ratcliffe clearly sees plenty of potential in them.
Why are Venezuelans seeking refuge in crypto-currencies?:::::Image copyright Megan Janetsky Image caption Eli Meregote uses crypto-currencies to send money home to Venezuela Crypto-currencies have faced a lot of criticism since Bitcoin first came on the scene 10 years ago.But for one group of people, they're proving very useful.Venezuela has seen its currency rendered practically valueless after suffering one of the worst periods of hyperinflation since World War Two.A cup of coffee now costs 2,800 bolivars (21p; 28 cents), up from 0.75 bolivars 12 months ago - an increase of 373,233%, according to Bloomberg data.And that's after a 2018 devaluation that knocked five zeros off the currency.More than three million Venezuelans have left the country, as essential goods such as toilet paper and medicine have become unaffordable and crime has soared.As a result, many are turning to digital assets such as Bitcoin as an alternative to the Venezuelan bolivar.And given how volatile Bitcoin is - its value has plunged from nearly 15,000 in 2017 to less than 3,000 now - it's an indication of just how desperate people have become.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bitcoin may be volatile but the Venezuelan bolivar has been losing value much faster Even the government has launched its own crypto-currency, the Petro, supposedly backed by oil, to provide a solution to the economic crisis.But critics say it is a sham and there is no evidence of anyone using it.Eli Meregote, 28, has been using Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies as a way of sending money home from Colombia where he now lives and works, avoiding the fees usually associated with money transfer services such as Western Union."I first discovered crypto in 2017 when I lost my job in Venezuela," the CCTV technician says."Even if I had my job, it would've been useless anyway, because the minimum wage was $4 a month."Cryptos offered him "total control" of his money "without banks or third parties", he says."With Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, I can send money home faster and without obstacles."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Venezuela blackout crisis: "It's like living in the apocalypse" Bitcoin was designed to be a global, digital currency that governments and banks couldn't interfere with.Like many other crypto-currencies it works by recording all transactions permanently on a distributed ledger called the blockchain.Critics say Bitcoin and other cryptos - there are more than 1,600 globally - are unstable, use too much energy, and are used by money launderers or those wanting to buy illicit goods on the web.But for Venezuelans, storing their money in a digital wallet in the form of Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash or any of the others, is still a better option than holding on to the national currency.Adoption has rocketed, with trading volumes on Localbitcoins.com - a person-to-person Bitcoin trading platform - rivalling those of the US.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness Although trading volumes dipped in March due to a power cut that plunged the country into darkness for days, February saw trading levels reach 6.84m ($8.76m) per week and nearly 1m per day, according to crypto-currency data tracker Coin Dance."Many Venezuelans are using Bitcoin to convert their bolivars, which are being permanently devalued by hyperinflation, to keep something of value," says economist Asdrubal Oliveros of Caracas-based consultancy Econanalitica."It is practically a vehicle for buying foreign currency and to conserve value, as it is relatively easy and you can keep small amounts which do not involve large investments."Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Venezuelan bolivar notes are now useful only for making handicraft gifts Mr Oliveros points out that in Venezuela many people work as freelancers, receiving their pay in bitcoin since in most cases they do not have accounts abroad that allow them to make transfers in dollars."Receiving payments in bolivars does not make much sense," he says.Matt Aaron, who manages the Venezuela arm of Bitcoin.com, the crypto-currency news and trading platform, says: "We pay our team members in Caracas in Bitcoin Cash.Transactions are instant and cost less than a cent to make."Ricardo Carrasco, 29, an IT engineer who is paid in bitcoin, is a fan of the crypto-currency."It has given me access to the financial world outside Venezuela," he says."We are not free to exchange our currency for US dollars or any other currency.We don't have access to the banking services of the world, so crypto allows you to bypass those barriers."Image copyright Ricardo Carrasco Image caption Ricardo Carrasco likes Bitcoin's borderless nature Mr Carrasco sells small amounts of Bitcoin on Localbitcoins.com and other exchanges, and receives money in bolivars to his Venezuelan account.He is then able to buy goods with his card as and when he needs to."It is a pretty simple, straightforward process," he says.But Venezuela's government is intervening, recently launching a remittance service that caps the amount of crypto-currency someone inside the country can receive.It has started earning commissions from the transactions.More Technology of Business One thing is certain: despite the Bitcoin crash and loss in value of other crypto-currencies, Venezuelans have more interest in digital assets than ever before.In the Colombian border town of Cucuta, which sees tens of thousands of fleeing Venezuelans arrive every day, a new crypto-currency cash machine (ATM) was opened in March.It is designed to make carrying funds safer and more convenient.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Security services have clashed with looters panicking about short supplies of goods "With the ATM, Venezuelans can receive bitcoin from anywhere in the world and cash out in Colombian pesos right away," says Matias Goldenhrn from Athena, the company that installed the machine."A Venezuelan family of four, getting on a bus in Cucuta to emigrate to Argentina, was carrying all their life savings in cash on their 14-day bus journey," he recalls."They just exchanged all the money into bitcoin and, once they arrived at their final destination, sold the crypto for the local currency, hence not risking travelling with the money on them."It made life a lot easier for them."At least there is one country in the world where Bitcoin is serving a practical value for ordinary citizens rather than speculators.Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Exam failure who became a multi-millionaire hotelier:::::Image copyright Robin Hutson Image caption Robin Hutson has had an illustrious career in the hotel industry The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to Robin Hutson, founder and chief executive of UK hotel business Home Grown Hotels.Robin Hutson's life would probably have been far less successful if he hadn't failed his school exams."I managed to screw up all my O-levels, and wasn't invited to sixth-form college," recalls the 62-year-old."So I had to find something else to do."At the age of 16 I wasn't interested in doing much apart from chasing girls, and my mother said 'well, you always liked messing around in the kitchen'."Image copyright Robin Hutson Image caption To launch the first Hotel du Vin, Robin and his wife Judy put their home up as guarantee She advised her son to enrol on a course in hotel and catering operations, which whetted his appetite for a career in the hospitality industry.He went on to establish the popular Hotel du Vin chain in 1994, which made him a multi-millionaire 10 years later when he and his business partner sold the company for 66m.Since 2011 Robin has build up another collection of hotels, called The Pig.Currently with six locations across the south of England, the company behind the brand - Home Grown Hotels - has annual revenues of more than 20m.While Robin's successful career has seen him dubbed "Britain's most influential hotelier", you cannot accuse him of not serving a decent apprenticeship.After graduating from catering college in Surrey, south of London, in the mid 1970s, he joined the management training programme of the then Savoy Group of hotels.Image copyright Home Grown Hotels Image caption Robin's hotels always put a big emphasis on the food they offer This saw him start as a junior waiter at the five-star London hotel Claridge's, before moving across to the equally prestigious Hotel de Crillon in Paris.He then returned to London where, at the age of 23, he became the youngest ever reception manager at The Berkeley.This was followed by two years at a hotel in Bermuda.He was lured back to the UK when he was offered the position of general manager at a hotel in Hampshire when he was just 28.Robin clocked up eight years in that job.but then decided it was time to strike out on his own."I was 36, I'd done a fair amount of working for others, and I thought 'is that what I want to do for the rest of my life, or will I try and do something else?'."Image copyright Home Grown Hotels Image caption The Pig hotels are mostly country retreats The something else was a boutique city centre hotel, with a particular focus on the food and wine.So in 1994 he teamed up with his friend, Gerard Basset, a former sommelier, to launch Hotel du Vin in Winchester, Hampshire.To raise the money he needed, Robin says he managed to persuade his wife Judy to agree that they would put their house up as a guarantee."It's probably the bravest thing Judy has ever done, and thank God she did," he says.Robin and Gerard also raised 500,000 from friends and family, and borrowed 750,000 from the bank."I sort of passed the hat around anyone we knew had a spare bob," says Robin.Image copyright Robin Hutson Image caption Robin Hutson, left, is an enthusiastic long distance cyclist in his spare time Due to a lack of resources, the two founders were forced to roll up their sleeves."Gerard and I used to take time sleeping on the sofa to provide night cover," he says."It was exhausting, we were doing everything from making breakfast to serving in the restaurant.But we were profitable in the first year."Striving to offer guests something new, Hotel du Vin provided fresh milk in the mini bars, and served decent ground coffee.While those two things don't seem imaginative now, Robin says that at the time they were "seen as revolutionary" in the hotel industry.More The Boss features: Hotel du Vin grew into a chain of six hotels, but on its 10th anniversary Robin and Gerard sold up to an investment group, after they said they were given an offer they couldn't refuse.Robin went on to become chairman of the Soho House private club chain for four years.Then in 2008 he set up a new five star hotel in Hampshire, called Lime Wood.The first The Pig hotel opened nearby in 2011.As was the case at Hotel du Vin, Judy leads the design of the interiors of each The Pig location.Robin chose the name because he likes a well-known New York restaurant called The Spotted Pig.Zoe Monk, editor of Boutique Hotelier magazine, says that the secret of Robin's success is his "ability to spot where the market is heading and identify gaps in the hospitality sector".Image copyright Robin Hutson Image caption Robin called his latest hotel chain The Pig after being inspired by the Spotted Pig restaurant in New York She adds: "He creates trends and experiences that tap into a new mindset... after noticing what was missing from the mainstream market."Last year, trade magazine The Caterer ranked Robin as the UK's second most powerful hotelier.Looking forward, the publication's editor Chris Gamm says that Robin and other hotel owners may face recruitment difficulties due to Brexit."A major challenge the industry is currently facing is recruiting and retaining enough staff, which will be especially hard for Robin as he's in the process of opening new hotels," says Mr Gamm.Robin agrees that Brexit is a worry."Everyone in the hospitality industry is concerned how staffing will tighten up," he says."In the industry we generally rely on a lot of labour from outside the UK.About 25% of our 700 staff are non-Brits."As to his plans for the future of The Pig chain, and his other hotel business - Lime Wood Group - he is keeping his aspirations in check."I have no ambition to grow a 50-strong hotel chain," he says."It's not my thing," says Robin, who in December rode a motorcycle 7,000 km (4,350 miles) across Chile and Argentina."I don't know how many more I'll open.It's got to be the right property and right location."
Mopping up Dieselgate: The boss transforming Volkswagen:::::Image copyright Volkswagen Image caption Hiltrud Werner grew up in East Germany, where "more than 90% of the women worked" Hiltrud Werner knows how to handle rooms full of men.As the lone woman on Volkswagen's management board, she is a rarity in the upper echelons of German industry.Yet her ascent was not the result of an effort to blend in.Ms Werner's first appearance in front of an all-male board was less than a decade ago - at a firm she declines to name - and it was a memorable one."I got a very nice email that said: 'Please Hiltrud, wear trousers, they are not used to skirts in the boardroom,'" she recalls with a playful grin."Of course, I came in a pink dress."The 52-year-old joined Volkswagen's board in February 2017, at one of the most turbulent moments in the carmaker's history.As head of integrity, she was charged with putting VW's house in order, and reforming a corporate culture which turned a blind eye to the widespread cheating of diesel-emissions tests.In the German press, she is often portrayed as a matron-like figure, hired to clean up a mess made by men who should have known better.It is a characterisation she dislikes - noting that women are among those charged in the various "Dieselgate" investigations.However, it is hard to overlook the irony of the appointment: when a woman finally got to the top of VW, she was handed a poisoned chalice.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Volkswagen is in the process of repairing the damage to its brand Ms Werner says she considered it an "honour" to be asked to oversee VW's turnaround, but she is under no illusions about the scale of the task.To date, the diesel emissions scandal has cost Volkswagen roughly 28bn, ($31bn; 24bn) and her prediction is that 2019 will be the firm's "most difficult year" ever.The pressure on her is not just internal.Her efforts are being closely scrutinised by the court-appointed monitor Larry Thompson, a former US Attorney General who worked on the prosecutions of Enron executives, and whose task it is to evaluate whether the group's ethics programmes are robust enough to prevent further criminal activity.Since Ms Werner's interview for this piece, the company has faced further negative headlines.Its chief executive, Herbert Diess, apologised for evoking a Nazi slogan, while American regulators filed suit against VW, claiming it misled investors in the run-up to Dieselgate."We are still busy with the root cause analysis," Ms Werner explains.The origins of the Dieselgate scandal, she maintains, are "complex" but that VW felt it was "too big to fail" and there was not enough self reflection, employees thought what they did "in the context of the company, was good".To try to remedy that, Ms Werner and her team have rewritten the job specifications for more than 2,000 people, "to make sure that roles and responsibilities are clear and that everyone understands what their obligations are".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Germany needs to reflect on how it views women in business, says Ms Werner But she is not content with challenging the culture of one of Germany's largest companies, and has her sights set on transforming her compatriots' attitudes to women in power.That task may prove to be even more daunting: Germany, as she points out, was one of last developed economies to get an anti-discrimination law, in 2006.At the time of writing, not a single one of German's top 30 firms has a female chief executive.The Reykjavik Index - a survey of 10,000 people across the G7 group of nations conducted by Kantar and Women's Political Leaders - found that only 29% of Germans would feel very comfortable having a woman at the helm of a major company.(For comparison, almost 60% of British respondents were very comfortable with the concept.One theory is that austerity has forced more women into work in the UK, which in turn led to greater cultural acceptance.)Many of Ms Werner's fellow corporate leaders do not grasp the scale of Germany's problem.When touring other companies' offices, she says, executives sometime say: "Oh you know what, we did really well, we've got a woman on the board."Image copyright VW Image caption Germany's car industry is still male-dominated When she appears in public in Germany calling for equal pay and equal opportunities, "people think I'm the chief human resources officer", she says.In other words, they don't see her cause as being central to a company's overall governance.The lack of progress within German business is in stark contrast to the country's political arena.Angela Merkel is in her 14th year as chancellor.Her most likely successor, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, is a woman, as is Andrea Nahles, who leads their coalition partners, the SPD.Hiltrud Werner and Angela Merkel have something in common - both were brought up in East Germany, a country, Ms Werner points out, in which "more than 90% of the women worked".With some sympathy, she recalls how Mrs Merkel was publicly dismissed by her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder, in the immediate aftermath of her first win in 2005.But she is critical of the way in which the chancellor went about winning over her critics.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption VW's headquarters are being closely scrutinised by a US monitor "She has been seen as very gender neutral," says Ms Werner, adding that Mrs Merkel is "always wearing trousers - boring outfits, you could say".Ms Werner makes an effort to do the opposite: "I don't want to be a woman dressed like a man, I often intentionally come in colourful dresses."Not having children has also helped Mrs Merkel overcome German prejudices."She has never been seen as a working mother that left her kids at home," says Ms Werner."She did not experience all the struggles that other women in leading positions feel."That's why we have such a long way still to go in Germany, because the role model is just half a role model."Not that Ms Werner is immune to the pressure felt by women in the workplace to please their male peers.At the start of her 28-year career in the car industry, she confesses, she was just "looking for a survival strategy" and taught herself to speak "the language of men" in an attempt to blend in.Image copyright AFP Image caption Angela Merkel is "just half a role model", says Hiltrud Werner She learned that "if you are asked what car you are driving, and you answer 'a red one' then that is wrong".Instead she would show colleagues pictures of her particular model - highlighting its engine power and how exhilarating she found it to drive on alpine roads.This adjustment was a part of "making sure everyone understands that you love the product," she says.As VW goes about repairing its reputation, Ms Werner wants the firm's hundreds of thousands of employees to hear the same message: that she has the car industry's best interests at heart."I have a lot of fuel in my blood," she says, pausing to acknowledge Volkswagen's next big bet."Maybe in future I will have to say I have some electricity in my blood."
AI and spices: Would you put cumin on a pizza?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption What role can technology play in the ancient art of spice mixing?What do Tuscan Chicken, Bourbon Pork Tenderloin and New Orleans Sausage all have in common?They're all new spice mix flavours that have been developed by the world's biggest spice firm using artificial intelligence (AI).But with taste such a subjective experience, can machines really do the job better than humans?And what does this mean for cultures that see spice as a clear token of identity?Spice giant McCormick, which sells spices to consumers but also develops flavours for the food industry, says it spent four years crunching through more than 40 years of flavour-related data, using machine learning to come up with new flavour combinations that human scientists might not have considered.After all, would you have thought of trying cumin on pizza?But some traditional spice producers are unimpressed.Neelam Verhomal runs Mohanlal Verhomal (MV) Spices in Jodhpur, northern India, along with her mother and six sisters.She laughs when she hears about the AI developments.Image copyright MV Spices Image caption Neelam Verhomal uses traditional methods to blend spices in her spice store in India For her, there is a real human art to creating the perfect spice blends."My late father Mohanlal was a scientist and inventor and he actually tested each spice and its chemical composition to prepare the masala blends," she says."My mother would then do the taste test at home - and that made a big difference."Her family's mixes don't contain preservatives or flavour enhancers and are made using traditional grinding methods, with matriarch Bhagvanti overseeing the process and giving the final sign-off.So McCormick and its tech partner IBM Research are straying into controversial territory.As someone of Kenyan-Indian heritage, I can testify that it's rare for a South Asian family not to possess a masala dabba - a storage box used to create spice blends at home filled with staples such as turmeric, cumin, paprika and asafoetida (hing).Our own one is more than 60 years old and has travelled through several continents and generations.Image copyright Dhruti Shah Image caption Many South Asian homes have a masala dabba spice box as a fixture in the kitchen Spices aren't just a flavour, they're key to culture, heritage and history.So does AI really have a role to play here?Dr Hamed Faridi, McCormick's chief science officer, says that deep analysis of tens of thousands of previously successful spice mixes is helping the company come up with new flavours more quickly."A product, from the beginning to the end, can take somewhere between 50 to 150 iterations before it is ready for commercialisation," Dr Faridi says.If all that data is shared and analysed, the company says it could cut the time it takes to come up with new flavours by 70% and reduce training time for new product developers."It takes an experienced product developer about 10 to 15 years to become highly trained in what they do, so it makes business sense to develop a system that means every person is as good as the best person we have," says Dr Faridi.Combining flavours is a complex business it seems."In a kitchen [at home] you might have maybe one or two types of fresh garlic and possibly a garlic powder," explains IBM research scientist Dr Robin Lougee."But a product developer at McCormick will have potentially 50 different types of garlic, all of which are different sizes, different granule sizes, have different flavour profiles.On top of that they have to consider all of the other constraints."These constraints - usually client requirements - can include the need for recipes to be kosher or halal, free from genetically modified organisms, or low in salt, for example, as well as needing regulatory approval.More Technology of Business The AI is also useful for suggesting similar flavours that might act as a substitute if a certain spice is hard to come by, says Dr Lougee.But sometimes the AI isn't all that clever."In the early days of our collaboration, a product developer was trying to make a Cajun rice dish," she says."We tried out our suggestion generation engine and it created a great Cajun spice mix, but it left out all the rice."It hadn't yet learned that you have to take into account the application, so all it had done was create a seasoned salt," she says.Food technology historian Dr Nadia Berenstein says that in a world full of so many food and drink choices there is a "restless search for novelty" in an increasingly competitive industry.And the battleground is flavour.Image copyright The Science of Spice/DK Image caption Dr Stuart Farrimond's "periodic table" of spices in his book The Science of Spice Neelam does admit that technology can play a part, given that spices such as green cardamom and pepper from Kerala have been hard to source recently.AI-suggested alternatives could be useful.But if you don't have access to commercially sensitive databases produced by the largest spice company in the world, Dr Stuart Farrimond, author of The Science of Spice, has come up with a spice-based periodic table for home cooks.He believes people now want to know more about where their food has come from and how it is made."Spices have always been in demand but there appears to have been a rise in flavour transparency because people are interested in health and also what is going into the food that they are cooking," he says.So should traditional spice mix producers fear AI?"AI is just a tool that's available to our generation to be able to do what humans have always done, and that's to explore new tastes and experiences," says Dr Lougee.That may be true, but just don't think of taking away our masala dabba.Follow Dhruti Shah on Twitter @dhrutishah Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook
Ethiopian Airlines probe: What do we know?:::::Image copyright Jonathan Druion Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed on Sunday morning killing all 157 people on board.It's led to a serious crisis for Boeing.The company manufactured the 737 Max 8 plane that was involved.The model has now been grounded globally as the pressure mounts in a search for answers.Current estimates of the number of 737 Max 8 and 9s grounded ranges from 350 to 370.That represents a significant cost for airlines using the plane as routes, schedules and passengers are affected.The race is on for investigators to find answers - and fast.What do we know?The flight data recorder (FDR) and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), or black boxes as they are often called, arrived in France on Thursday morning for inspection by the Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety (BEA), the French version of the UK's Air Accident Investigation Branch.Ethiopian inspectors chose to send the black boxes to France even though there are similar facilities in Nigeria, Dubai, Singapore, Germany and here in the UK at Farnborough.But it is the country where the accident happens that makes the decision on where the black boxes go.The BEA in France is a highly respected organisation with considerable expertise in this area.In addition, part of the engines on the Boeing 737 Max 8 are manufactured by a French American conglomerate so this may have played a part.How did they find the black boxes?One of the biggest challenges in air accident investigation is locating the black boxes after a crash.In modern aircraft, the black boxes are fitted at the back of the aircraft as history has shown that this area tends to sustain crash impact better.In the instance of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302, the plane is reported to have hit the ground nose first at high speed.The rear of the aircraft was therefore closer to the surface which made it easier to find and retrieve the black boxes.Now they've got the black boxes, what comes next?Firstly, what state are they in?Black boxes are engineered to withstand huge force in order to protect the all-important data chips inside.But the casing could be crushed which means soldering it open.Connectors inside could also be damaged which means starting the analysis could be delayed further.Once data chips are in hand, the information stored needs to be interpreted.Image copyright BEA Image caption The BEA tweeted a picture of a black box from the Ethiopian Airlines plane But the way that data is stored is not the same across the industry.Recording differs between specific aircraft models, operators and airlines.For completely accurate data, conversion information held by Ethiopian Airlines will be necessary.It is hoped that conversion detail is readily available.Each black box holds 25 hours of flight information.The last flight will be the prime focus but previous flights (over the 25 hour period of the recording) are also likely to be looked at to see if there were any anomalies.What about the investigation in Ethiopia?The investigation in Ethiopia will be led by an investigator from that country, but will be assisted by teams from around the world, all with an interest in the crash.The US will have sent investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board, as the Boeing 737 Max-8 was manufactured there.It is also thought French investigators are on site due to the black boxes making their way to France.Three investigators from the UK arrived in Ethiopia on Tuesday to provide assistance, but plans are being made for them to return to the UK.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Investigators in Ethiopia are continuing to search for evidence What are the investigators on the ground looking at?How investigators work on the ground differs from country to country dependent on the lead investigator.But generally, separate teams will focus on different disciplines.Core areas include: Engineering: Understanding how the plane's workings, design and systems contributed Operations: Interviewing eye-witnesses, flight crew, operators and regulators Flight data: Black boxes, surveillance and en-route radar, CCTV, still and video cameras Human factors: Understanding how the sequence of events led to the accident.The investigation in the field is only the start of a very long process.Once everything has been documented and photographed, and witnesses have been contacted, the wreckage is usually recovered and transported to a secure facility for extensive analysis.Timing - what can we expect?Work on the black boxes will begin in Paris on Friday.The first image of a black box reveals the damage it sustained after the crash and subsequent explosion.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bereaved families have been paying their respects at the crash site When any data has been extracted, it will then be passed back to the lead investigator in Ethiopia, who will decide on the course of action and what information to release.A former investigator told me that the team in Paris will work day and night because of the global interest in this crash and the impact it is having on airlines, passengers and, most importantly, the bereaved families.Interest in the what happened with Ethiopia Airlines flight 302 has been heightened because of reported similarities with a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October 2018.Both flights were using the Boeing 737 Max 8.But it could be tomorrow, the weekend or next week before we start to get the first answers.
Boeing grounded: What it means for air travel:::::Image copyright Getty Images The grounding of Boeing's 737 Max fleet is expected to cause little air travel disruption - at least for now.The plane-maker grounded its global fleet of the aircraft as a safety precaution after new evidence emerged about a fatal crash involving the jet.The 737 Max is flown by airlines around the world for short trips.Analysts say the initial impact of the grounded jets will be contained, but may escalate if the fleet is not permitted to fly for a longer period.How popular is the 737 Max?The 737 Max has been the fastest-selling aircraft in Boeing's history, with more than 4,500 ordered by 100 different operators globally.But the model still only accounts for a small proportion of travel around the world.Globally, airlines were scheduled to fly just under 700,000 commercial flights this week, data from flight consultancy OAG shows.Of those, 6,548 were due to be operated by a Boeing 737 Max variant."We are talking about just 1% of global flights planned for the aircraft this week," said OAG's John Grant.Which regions will be most affected by the grounded jets?The Boeing 737 Max 8 - the model involved in the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday - is generally used for short-haul and domestic flights.Analysts say North America will face the most disruption as Southwest Airlines, Air Canada and American Airlines are the three largest operators of the 737 Max aircraft in the world.Ellis Taylor, Asia Finance Editor at Flight Global, said the grounding of the aircraft "will have some impact" on US schedules.Still, even if the grounded jets prompts some flight cancellations, analysts expect airlines will be able to accommodate passengers by putting them on other flights, using alternative aircraft or putting old jets back into action."There is plenty of capacity available globally to accommodate this capacity loss for quite a long period of time," OAG's Mr Grant said.Flight Global's Mr Taylor said the scheduled 737 Max flights in the US will mostly run using other jets, but there may be "some inconvenience over the next couple of days as the airlines implement their contingency plans".What will happen next?The level of disruption will depend on how long the 737 Max aircraft are forbidden to fly.That will turn on how long the investigation into what caused the Ethiopian Airlines crash takes, and what the cause is determined to be.It could take some time.A preliminary report on the October Lion Air disaster was released about a month after the crash.The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which has a team investigating the Ethiopian Airlines crash site, has drawn parallels between the two disasters.Flight Global's Mr Taylor said it now looks more likely the grounding "will extend at least a few weeks, and potentially into a few months, but it all depends on what safety issues are identified".
Classic car industry fears Trump and Brexit roadblock:::::Image copyright Elliot Cuker Image caption Elliot Cuker has seen sales slow sharply For more than four decades Elliot Cuker has been selling classic cars from his garage in New York, but last year he hit a roadblock."I have been in business for 42 years, and 2018 stands out as one of the worst," he says.Now in his 70s, Mr Cuker remembers when his company, Cooper Classics Collection, could sell more than 100 cars a year.Lately, he says, people are buying far fewer."I don't know where things are going right now.I don't know if they'll ever be as strong as they were."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The value of classic cars soared as a result of the global financial crisis While the global financial crisis of 2007-08 was a worrying time for most people, for Mr Cuker and the whole global classic car industry, it marked the start of a decade-long boom.As stock markets slumped, wealthy investors turned to putting their money into luxury assets, such as art, high-end property, expensive wines - and especially classic cars."That was my best year, 2008, believe it or not, when we had that stock market crash," says Mr Cuker."At least you know that if you invest in a car, a classic car, that you have it and it's [at least historically] consistently always gone up in value."Such was the rise in the price of classic cars that one report from insurance firm Axa Art said that the average value of vintage vehicles soared 192% between 2006-17, compared with growth of just 84% across the wider luxury goods sector.But last year, average classic car prices rose just 1%, according to a separate report by classic car index Hagerty Price Guide.Image copyright Elliot Cuker Image caption Classic car prices easily outpaced gains across the wider luxury goods sector in the decade to 2017 While some slowdown is highly likely after such a strong decade of growth, most in the industry blame President Trump's threat to hit car and car parts imports to the US with tariffs of as much as 25%.The president first asked the US Commerce Department to investigate the issue in May last year.Then in November he tweeted that a 25% tariff on imported cars would mean that "many more cars would be built here".With no suggestion that older vehicles and parts will be given an exemption, the Commerce Department filed its confidential report on the issue to President Trump on 17 February.He now has until 18 May to decide whether to hit car imports with a tariff, as he has already done to imported vans.Many in the wider automotive industry expect some kind of import levies.Those in the classic car sector say it would have a substantially negative impact.Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: "When you get to tariffs, right now the importation rate to the US on a classic car, or classic car parts is 2.5% [the same as for new cars and parts]," says Rory Jurnecka, features editor at US publication Automobile Magazine."A tenfold increase, when we're talking about tariffs, to 25%, is really unsustainable.And I think will basically bring any global industry, as it pertains to the US, to a halt."But President Trump's tariff threat is not the only issue causing the classic car industry anxiety.The UK's continuing Brexit uncertainty is another factor said to be weighing heavily on the sector.Malcolm Barber, co-chairman of auction house Bonhams, which has its headquarters in London, says Brexit has led to "caution" among UK car collectors "as it has in most industries in Britain".Image copyright Mary Balfour Image caption Rodger Dudding has a vast collection of classic cars Yet despite all this doom and gloom and the current twists in the road, others say that the classic car industry will remain strong.One such person is avid collector Rodger Dudding."I think at the last count I have something like about 430 classic motor vehicles," says the 81-year-old multimillionaire."To my mind, without being too dramatic, they are three-dimensional art."If you look at modern day cars, this model or that model, they're all so similar, and they're boring.They don't have personality."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Classic car collector Rodger Dudding spoke to the BBC in 2018 Mr Dudding, who made his fortune in the self-storage industry, owns nine Ferraris and 24 Aston Martins.He hires out his cars to TV and film productions, such as The Crown and Mary Poppins Returns."We are still investing in cars," he says."We believe the market will be maintained."Image copyright Patrick Ernzen Image caption This Ferrari 250 GTO could have been yours last August, if you had more than $48m to hand This confidence is shared by Kenneth Ahn, president of car auction firm RM Sotheby's.He points to the fact that last August RM Sotheby's sold a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO for $48.4m (36.8m), at an auction in California.This was the most expensive car ever sold at auction."We are optimistic about 2019," says Mr Ahn."Even though there are macro concerns, for truly rare and important cars the collector demand is still very healthy."
Do supermarkets know more about us than we do?:::::Image copyright Getty Images When you buy something at the supermarket, what makes you pick one brand - or one product - over another?Retailers invest huge sums trying to understand this decision-making process, or influence it, in a UK grocery market worth almost 200bn.We know supermarkets can learn a huge amount about us by studying what we buy.But our research also suggests that we form personal bonds with products over time, as we try to self-justify our buying decisions.In short, we do not just buy what we prefer, we end up preferring what we buy; and this means we are more open to influence than we might think.Analysing the decisions we make in the supermarket can help us understand the choices we make in other areas of our lives.Shaped by our choices To explore shoppers' decision-making, we collected more than a million till receipts from one of the UK's major supermarket chains over several years.Unsurprisingly, we discovered that people's purchases reveal what they value and what their aims are.These range from very specific goals such as making a stir-fry, to general goals such as reducing their overall spending.Image copyright Getty Images But our relationships with products go a step further, according to a second study involving loyalty card customers.Analysing the buying decisions of 280,000 customers revealed that they fell into a self-reinforcing cycle, where they became more and more attached to a product.These cycles tend to last for several consecutive store visits before the pattern is broken and the process starts again with a different brand.Interestingly, when consumers break out of these self-reinforcing loops, they tend to do so across multiple products at a time.For example, when switching their brand of coffee, they are more likely to change their brands of yoghurt and washing detergent as well.Blind loyalty Why does this loyalty build up?Further analysis of the data ruled out simpler explanations, such as price or force of habit being responsible for these patterns.One explanation is that people come to like what they purchase, out of a need to "make sense" and explain their choices to themselves and others.For example, after buying the ingredients for a salad, a consumer might start to value healthy foods more to justify the purchase.This pattern of behaviour could be exploited to try to create a relationship with a selected product.In the loyalty card study, we sent the supermarket's instant coffee drinking customers coupons to try a different brand.Those in the switching phase were twice as likely to use the coupon as those still locked in to their existing coffee product.Beyond shopping This self-justified decision making is not limited to the weekly shop, but probably spills over to many areas of our lives.For example, studies suggest people defend their selection of everything from the jam they buy to the politicians they decide to vote for in an election.After we vote for a leader we may mimic their positions on many issues, including those we were undecided about or even to which we were opposed.More stories like this Finding a 'hidden gem' Image copyright Getty Images Human decision-making can sometimes be more logical, with takeaway food choices one example of this.A wide-ranging study looked at users of a popular food delivery app in 197 cities, to deduce how they decided from which restaurant to order.It is natural to think the app's users make their ordering decision based on ratings and popularity.In reality, we found they were more interested in finding "hidden gems" with fewer positive reviews.This may seem counter-intuitive and wrong, but this is actually how sophisticated machine-learning systems deal with uncertainty.The more reviews a restaurant has, the more trustworthy the rating is.When a restaurant only has a few reviews, even if they are not very positive, there is still a decent chance that the restaurant will be excellent.After all, those few reviewers may just be off the mark.In contrast, when a restaurant has many good - but not excellent - reviews, the odds are vanishingly small that the restaurant is exceptional.In effect, customers prefer to take a chance on greatness rather than a guarantee of mediocrity.Image copyright Getty Images We found that people ordering in cities with better restaurants are more likely to take risks.This is a smart move, because you are more likely to chance upon an excellent restaurant in a city with a good food scene.However, our research indicates that when people do explore and are burned by a bad experience, they return to familiar and unhealthy choices, like hamburgers.A method to the madness Although consumers might not be aware of it, their purchases reveal a great deal about them.While they may appear to be mindlessly browsing food delivery options after a night out, the data trail they leave reveals a method to the madness.We now know that when loyalty to one product is broken, consumers are likely to switch other products too.Shoppers could take advantage of this window to replace bad habits with good ones, but could also be more susceptible to advertisements for new products.Our understanding of human decision-making is improving all the time.Combined with advancements in AI, this could help unlock not just our food choices but all of the decisions that we make.About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation.Brad Love is a fellow at The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national centre for data science and artificial intelligence.He is also professor of Cognitive and Decision Sciences at University College London.You can follow him on Twitter here.Professor Love has previously worked as a consultant for Customer Data Science company dunnhumby.Edited by Eleanor Lawrie
Meet Tengai, the job interview robot who won't judge you:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Would you be happy being interviewed by a robot?The world's first robot designed to carry out unbiased job interviews is being tested by Swedish recruiters.But can it really do a better job than humans?Her name is Tengai.Measuring 41cm (16in) tall and weighing 3.5kg (7.7lbs) she's at eye level as she sits on top of a table directly across from the candidate she's about to interview.Her glowing yellow face tilts slightly to the side.Then she blinks and smiles lightly as she poses her first question: "Have you ever been interviewed by a robot before?"Tengai is the brainchild of Furhat Robotics, an artificial intelligence (AI) and social robotics company born out of a research project at Stockholm's KTH Royal Institute of Technology.The firm has spent the past four years building a human-like computer interface that mimics the way we speak, as well as our subtle facial expressions.The idea, according to chief scientist Gabriel Skantze, is that "it feels much less scary or strange compared to a more traditional robot".Since October 2018, the start-up's been collaborating with one of Sweden's largest recruitment firms, TNG.The goal is to offer candidates job interviews that are free from any of the unconscious biases that managers and recruiters can often bring to the hiring process, while still making the experience "seem human".Image caption Elin berg Mrtenzon from recruitment agency TNG hopes Tengai will standardise interviews "It typically takes about seven seconds for someone to make a first impression and about five to 15 minutes for a recruiter to make a decision.We want to challenge that," explains Elin berg Mrtenzon, chief innovation officer at TNG's office in central Stockholm.Unconscious biases include making assumptions about someone's competence based on gender, ethnicity, voice, education, appearance, or as a result of informal conversations before or after an interview."For example, if I ask you a question at the beginning of the process like: 'Do you play golf?'and you say: 'Yes I do, I love playing golf', and I do too, then in some way I will put that in a positive box," says Ms Mrtenzon.Tengai, by contrast, doesn't engage in pre-interview chit-chat and poses all questions in an identical way, in the same tone, and typically, in the same order.This is thought to create a fairer and more objective interview.Recruiters or managers are then given text transcripts of each interview to help them decide which candidates should move to the next stage of the process, based on the answers alone.Image caption Recruiter Petra Elisson has been putting Tengai through her paces "I think it is a really good help while screening - if you have a big recruitment process with a lot of candidates - having someone, a robot, with no emotions, no feelings," says Petra Elisson, a 50-year-old who works in healthcare recruitment.She has been taking part in the trials, both as a recruiter analysing candidates transcripts and as an interviewee."I was quite sceptical at first before meeting Tengai, but after the meeting I was absolutely struck," she reflects."At first I really, really felt it was a robot, but when going more deeply into the interview I totally forgot that she's not human."But robots are programmed by humans, analyse datasets compiled by humans, and learn from human behaviour, so couldn't they inherit some of our biases?Furhat Robotics says it has sought to stop this by carrying out multiple test interviews using a diverse pool of volunteers."It's learning from several different recruiters so it doesn't pick up the specific behaviour of one recruiter," explains the start-up's chief scientist, Gabriel Skantze.Image caption Furhat Robotics' Gabriel Skantze says Tengai is trained to avoid human biases Following several months of trials, Tengai will start interviewing candidates for real later in May.Recruiters and developers are also working on an English-language version of the robot which is expected to be rolled out by early 2020.The goal is that she will eventually be sophisticated enough to decide for herself whether a candidate can move forward to the next stage of recruitment, avoiding the need for a human to review interview transcripts."Before we completely rely on that, we have to make sure that there is no bias in our data," explains Mr Skantze.Sweden does offer an especially interesting test bed for AI recruitment.As well as being a small country with a reputation for early adoption when it comes to new technologies, ethnic diversity in the labour market is a particularly hot topic following record immigration in recent years.Unemployment among native Swedes is around 4%, but for citizens born abroad the figure is more than 15%.Compare that to the UK, where 5% of foreign-born citizens are without a job.Image caption Bulgarian job seeker Ekaterina would welcome bias-free interview robots A recent survey for TNG suggested that 73% of job seekers in Sweden believe they have been discriminated against while applying for a job on the basis of their ethnicity, age, gender, sexual preferences, appearance, weight, health or disability."Swedish culture is very risk-averse, so normally they like the safe card... the Swedish person," says one Bulgarian job seeker who wants to be known only by her first name, Ekaterina, waiting outside a city centre employment agency.Ekaterina believes robots such as Tengai could be "great as a first step" in the recruitment process, because they "don't have any stereotypes about your dialect or accent or where you come from".The technology has also been championed by Diversity Foundation, a non-political, non-profit organisation that campaigns for more inclusion in the Swedish labour market."Any method that emphasises competency and skills over things like ethnicity is a welcome development and truly part of the Swedish innovation spirit," says chief operating officer Matt Kriteman.More Technology of Business A growing number of AI tools and technologies are being tested around the world in the field of recruitment.Among the most high-profile is HireVue, a US-based video platform that enables candidates to be interviewed at any time of day and uses algorithms to evaluate their answers and facial expressions.Seedlink, which has offices in Amsterdam and Shanghai, asks candidates to answer questions on their smartphones, and analyses their language to see if they're the right cultural fit for a role.And UK start-up JamieAi focuses on matching candidates with the right credentials for relevant job openings, seeking to eliminate bias by excluding demographic factors, such as name, age or ethnicity.Image copyright Dr Malin Lindelw Image caption Dr Malin Lindelw has several concerns about the use of robots in recruitment Swedish recruiter TNG says interviewees have enjoyed their encounters with Tengai.But some professionals have concerns.Dr Malin Lindelw, a Swedish psychologist who specialises in recruitment, says: "Recruiting is very much a leap of faith.It's a huge investment.It's a huge commitment.And you need to believe in the decision that you make."I find it very difficult to believe that recruiting managers will rely on a robot."She also points out that interviews - especially those in sectors where there is a skills shortage - can be as much about job seekers deciding whether or not they want to work for a company as the reverse."The candidate will come to the interview thinking: 'Is this a place where I want to work?'Is this somebody I want to work with?'They get their own gut feeling and it will affect their decision a great deal," she says."I am very concerned about what robots may do to that part of the process."
No-deal Brexit and how businesses are planning for it:::::Image copyright Ian Davies, Brussels Street Studio We're still no clearer on what will happen on 29 March when the UK is set to leave the European Union.The prime minister doesn't seem any closer to getting a deal finalised and leaving without one remains an option.If that happens it means the UK would leave the EU and cut ties immediately, with no agreement at all in place.Some economists warn that it could mean businesses have to pay more to send their products to countries in the rest of EU.The government says it's planning for a no-deal and told businesses to do the same.Radio 1 Newsbeat has been chatting to people who run their own companies to find out if they're preparing.'Keeping things local' Image copyright Alex Leslie Wyman Image caption Harvey and Rory are founders of Matcha Work Harvey Hodd is 23 and runs Matcha Works with his friend Rory Jeffries.They're a range of iced lattes containing matcha green teas with plant-based milks, including almond, coconut and oat milk.Harvey says the main thing they're trying to do is keep everything they do in the UK."A lot of manufacturing, especially for beverage companies, is in Europe or further afield."We had an option of working with a manufacturer in Austria but decided to stay in the UK because of the worries around Brexit."We thought if we can get something closer to home, yes, it's more expensive but it would safeguard against any future supply issues."Image copyright Alex Leslie Wyman Image caption Matcha Works was founded in 2018 The drink's main ingredient is plant-based milk, which Harvey says is hard to find in the UK."We formulated our own range of milks, but obviously we have to source the almonds, the coconuts and the oats."It's all well and good working directly with someone, but that doesn't create a supply chain, so we've had to find partners we can work with in the UK but it's really hard."Harvey says keeping things local means the cost goes up but there are benefits to keeping things in the UK "There's more control over the manufacturing if it's closer to home which is a benefit and is a strategic move and we can work in smaller quantities."'I'm optimistic about future deals' Image copyright Brussels Street Studio Image caption Jack Thompson and Amelia Watson have high hopes for Brexit In Leeds, Leave voter Jack Thompson and Amelia Watson, both 22, have a make-up company called MEMI.It's an online business that started in 2017, which has most of its customers in Europe.These two aren't preparing for a no-deal Brexit - they're going to wait and see what happens instead."In Parliament there might be a new development that can alter the direction of Brexit."We've taken the decision to wait and see before we restructure any of the business as one wrong decision could be costly."Jack told Newsbeat there are some things they'd have to consider if the UK left the EU without a deal.Image copyright Simon Lyle Ritchie Image caption MEMI is aimed at 16 to 22-year-olds "At the moment we have the free trade deals so we can depend on quick and reliable delivery, that's why we can have a shipping cost of 5.99."If we leave with no deal and we leave the customs union we would have to increase our shipping rate for international sales by about 3."We could end up paying a lot to ship large amounts of stock to Germany or France - that would impact our margins as we would have to factor in the cost customs checks."But he is optimistic about Brexit and any trade deals the government can do with other countries.Jack told Newsbeat: "I voted to leave and I stand by my vote."Depending on what trade deals we get outside of the EU, that could potentially be a massive help for us so we are hoping for free trade deals with the US and Australia," he adds.'It's a constant worry for me' Image copyright Ian Davies Image caption Jocelyn Evans has helped develop more than 40 brands Jocelyn Evans is 28 and runs a manufacturing company in Birmingham called Hook and Eye UK.She helps new or small clothes brands turn their designs into real products - she says she's helped set up more than 40.She voted to stay in the EU and says she's thinking out of the box to prepare for Brexit."Instead of offering the customers physical goods I am trying to offer more digital support."I think that's the only way people can get through a no deal Brexit - think of innovative ways to provide a business and still avoid costs."Joss told Radio 1 Newsbeat she thinks about Brexit a lot and worries about it too."I don't know what the full effects of a no deal Brexit will be to my business."If we come out of the EU and there are no trade deals that is going to put the price up on everything - it's a constant worry for me."Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.
‘I sold my wedding presents to set up my company’:::::Image copyright Twilio Image caption Jeff Lawson's entrepreneurial streak was first evident when he was 13 The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world.This week we speak to Jeff Lawson, co-founder and chief executive of US technology company Twilio.Jeff Lawson was all set to secure investment in his new start-up Twilio when suddenly people thought the world might be collapsing.Back on Monday, 15 September 2008, Jeff and his two co-founders walked into a meeting with potential investors in Silicon Valley.Getting the funding was supposed to be "almost a formality", remembers Jeff, who was 31 at the time.Unfortunately, US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed on the Sunday night, one of the most shocking moments of the then global financial crisis.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lehman Brothers' demise caused Twilio some problems "We walk in, and it's like chequebooks closed," says Jeff."People were wondering: 'Is the world melting?!'"My co-founders and I looked at each other and thought: 'Maybe this is a dumb idea.Maybe you know, maybe this is just stupid.'"The idea that Jeff and colleagues Evan Cooke and John Wolthuis had was a software business that helps companies automate communications with their users, be it by text message, or telephone and video calls.Fast forward to today, and San Francisco-based Twilio is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and worth more than $14bn (10.5bn).With annual revenue of $650m in 2018, its thousands of customers include Uber, WhatsApp, Coca-Cola, AirBnB, Twitter, eBay, and UK retailer Marks & Spencer.So when you get a text message from your Uber driver, Twilio's technology probably handles that interaction.The same if you telephone M&S - Twilio's technology will route the call.Or if you get a notification via numerous firms' mobile phone apps.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Uber is one of Twilio's major customers Back in September 2008 the success of Twilio was still a world away.After the funding had fallen though, Jeff says he felt as if the company - which they started work on in March of that year - was back at square one.But determined to carry on, he and his co-founders borrowed money from family and friends to get started on what techies refer to as the MVP - minimum viable product.As in, the most basic incarnation of their idea.When that first pot of money started to run out, Jeff - with the blessing of his wife Erica - sold their wedding presents.Twilio's first client was a man who had designed a website to help people find their missing mobile phone.You'd visit the site, input the number, pay a dollar, and it would ring your phone.Jeff and his colleagues made the process more automated.Hardly world-changing, but a client is a client.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jeff is a regular speaker at tech events A big break came in November 2008 when Twilio decided to show off its technology by pranking the most influential tech blogger of that era, Michael Arrington, founder of tech news website TechCrunch.It did this by telephoning him a recording of the pop song Never Gonna Give You Up by UK singer Rick Astley.At the time there was a craze to play the song unexpectedly, a phenomenon that was given the term "rickrolling".The publicity Twilio gained caught the attention of record label Sony Music, which called Jeff the next day."There was a guy who was a manager of one of their bands," says Jeff, now 41."And he said: 'Look, we've been trying to have this little promotion where the band records a voicemail, and we blast it out to fans who opt into this.Can we build it?'"I told him: 'Yeah sure, I've never heard of that idea.'"With Sony Music on board as a client, Jeff was able to go back to the same investors who had previously turned him down.This time they said yes, and Twilio secured $1m of seed funding at the start of 2009.It went on to raise $261m in investment, and in 2016 it floated on the stock market.Today it has 16 offices in 10 countries, and 1,275 employees.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As is the custom, Jeff was there in person when Twilio floated on the New York Stock Exchange Twilio's business model sees it charge companies for every communication with a customer.For a simple text message in the US the fee is $0.0075.That doesn't sound like much at all, but when a business is texting tens of millions of customers it can soon add up.Growing up in Detroit, Jeff's entrepreneurialism can be traced back to when, aged 13, he launched a video production company, despite knowing very little about it."My first event was a three-year-old's birthday party," he says."By the time I graduated high school I was doing full wedding videos, and I made $15,000 for that.So I graduated high school with a lot of money saved up."Also learning to code as a teenager, he wrote computer programs for his father's company, which provided the software for industrial printers.More The Boss features: Jeff then juggled doing a computer science and film and video course at the University of Michigan with business interests including running a company called Notes for Free.This offered college students a way to share notes and study material online.Senior jobs at ticketing firm StubHub and Amazon then followed, before the idea for Twilio was born.The company's success is down in part to its terrific timing - it emerged just as businesses were realising that customers, particularly the younger ones, would rather get a text message than have to make a phone call.Or if they did need to make a call, they were simply not prepared to sit on hold.However, it has not all been plain sailing for the business, with its shares slumping in 2016 and 2017 as it missed Wall Street's earnings targets.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Auction and retail website eBay is another company that uses Twilio's technology Alex Wilhelm, editor in chief of Crunchbase, a website that tracks tech investments, says: "Starting in mid-2016 Twilio went into Wall Street purgatory, losing more than half its value and seeing its stock stagnate until early 2018."Since then the company has been on a tear, appreciating rapidly and drawing accolades from media and investors alike.Twilio now has to prove that its sky-high revenue multiple is not dangerously inflated and that it can increase profitability while growing into its $14bn valuation."On a day-to-day basis Jeff says that Twilio staff are encouraged to solve problems on their own, without the need for hand-holding by bosses.To counteract the possibility for reckless decision making, the company also tells employees that there should be "no shenanigans".It is more straightforward, Jeff argues, than a vague, loftier declaration like "have integrity"."I know what the word integrity means," he says."But do I really know if what I'm doing right now has integrity?It can be hard to tell."But shenanigans you know, you know shenanigans."
Brexit: 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal:::::Image copyright Getty Images The EU has said Brexit can be delayed from 29 March by two weeks, with that date being pushed back further if Theresa May's withdrawal agreement gets through Parliament.But if MPs still don't agree on it, the UK has to propose a way forward - and European Council President Donald Tusk has said that the UK government would face "a choice between a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50".With all options still on the table, how would you be affected if the UK leaves the EU with no deal?1.The contents of your shopping basket may change What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects.About 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more expensive in the event of no deal.Increased import taxes and transport delays could all mean a rise in prices.And if a no-deal Brexit was followed by a fall in the value of the pound, that would also have the same effect.Supermarkets themselves have already warned that there could be empty shelves and higher prices.And Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that, in a worst-case scenario, our shopping bills could increase by 10%.The government has said that while a no-deal Brexit alone won't lead to food shortages, consumer behaviour could.Panic buying could mean food retailers run short of some products.Supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg.2.You will need to take extra measures when travelling to Europe Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe.If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork.Flights and Eurostar The government and the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) have both said that flights to and from the UK would still operate in a no-deal scenario.And Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensure their services run as smoothly as possible, despite a government assessment that warned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK.Visas In terms of paperwork, you won't need a visa for stays in countries in the Schengen area - where passports are not required and all other types of border control have been abolished (full list here) - of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period.However, you may need a visa if you intend to stay for longer.Passports Image copyright PA The government is also advising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months if you are travelling to the Schengen area.Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document.But the government has now warned that this time carried over will not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit.You can check if your passport has enough time left with this government tool.For countries that are in the EU but not in the Schengen area (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), you'll need to check the entry requirements for the country you're travelling to before you travel.Travel to Ireland is subject to separate Common Travel Area arrangements, which will remain the same after the UK leaves the EU.Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (the European Economic Area), the government has warned that it may become more expensive.European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, then in theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist.The government is advising travellers to buy insurance to cover health care "just as you would if visiting a non-EU country".Driving If you intend to drive in the EU after exit, you may need an International Driving Permit and a green card from your insurer.3.You may need to check medication is available and it may be more expensive Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU.Measures taken include: a six-week stockpile of essential medicines a plane chartered to fly in medical devices and clinical consumables that can't be stockpiled warehouses with refrigeration capacity rented ports other than Dover and Folkestone prepared to take ferries with lorries carrying imported medical supplies However, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society warned in January that pharmacists were struggling to obtain common medicines - including painkillers and anti-depressants.While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there are concerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse.Pharmacists have advised patients to order medicines in advance to give them time to deal with requests.And the Royal College of Radiologists has told doctors to prepare for delays in some drugs used to detect cancer, by reducing their workload in the days after the UK leaves the EU.4.UK nationals living abroad may have to take extra measures About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries.The government is advising UK nationals living in the EU, the EEA or Switzerland to take steps to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.These will differ according to the country being lived in.The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country.There is country-specific government advice here.Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU.If you are eligible, you should register for healthcare under your country's local rules.You may have to be a long-term legal resident or pay social security contributions to access free or discounted healthcare.The government recommends you get health insurance while you are applying for residency.UK students studying abroad are also advised to buy health insurance.Information on how to access healthcare abroad can be found on the NHS website.Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU.Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements.These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income/gain, and determine which country has primary taxing rights.5.EU citizens need to apply for 'settled status' The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members who are living in the UK.There are currently 3.8 million EU citizens living in the UK.If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has a tool to find out what you need to do and when.Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button 6.Importing goods from the EU may get more expensive Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure.As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU.But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply.Earlier this month, the government published a 1,477-page document outlining their plan for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Under the temporary scheme, 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access.At the moment 80% of imports are tariff free.Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture.Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection.7.House prices could be affected Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market.UK house prices grew at the slowest annual rate for nearly six years in January, according to the Nationwide.It said it was likely that the recent slowdown in the market was due to "the impact of the uncertain economic outlook on buyer sentiment".The Bank of England says the impact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant.It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a "disorderly Brexit".Property agents Savills suggest buyer confidence will have a bigger role to play than affordability in house price movements this year.8.Mobile phone roaming charges may rise Using your mobile in the EU may be more expensive in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government has warned.The amounts EU mobile operators would be able to charge UK operators for providing roaming services would no longer be regulated after Brexit.Digital, Culture and Media Secretary Jeremy Wright has said although mobile operators will be able to implement roaming charges if they want to, the government would be legislating to put a 45-a-month limit on the amount customers could be charged.To be safe, the government advises you to understand how to turn off data roaming on your mobile if you are worried about being charged.9.Some ports and motorways could see extra delays Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said there could be freight traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no deal, if additional customs checks are introduced in Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk - where freight services disembark.At the moment, freight vehicles going through Dover are subject to passport and security checks.But under a no-deal scenario, EU-bound lorries will also need to complete customs declarations, and certain goods may also require physical checks, and this could lead to bottlenecks.In this scenario, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20.Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side.If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used.Kent County Council says it has employed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal.10.UK students studying in the EU and EU students studying in the UK face a period of uncertainty More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17.UK universities say they would expect a similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.The government is committed to funding everything already agreed, so people who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them.But if the UK leaves the EU without a deal before the exchanges for the next academic year have been finalised, then the government would need European agreement to keep taking part.It has issued a technical note explaining this.That is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK.Meanwhile, Universities UK has launched a campaign supporting opportunities for studying abroad.Remind yourself of the Brexit basics with: .
Ethiopian Airlines: What do we know about Boeing 737 Max 8?:::::Image copyright Jonathan Druion Image caption The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed on Sunday The Ethiopian Airlines tragedy marks the second fatal crash within five months involving a new type of Boeing aircraft.The Boeing 737 Max 8 has only been in commercial use since 2017.In October last year a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max went down shortly after take-off from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board.That aircraft was less than three months old.Ethiopian Airlines flight ET302 also went down just minutes after take-off.The aircraft - registration ET-AVJ - first flew in October 2018, according to flight tracking websites.How the plane differed from previous model Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman told the BBC the 737 Max's "engine is a bit further forward and a bit higher in relation to the wing, compared to the previous version of the plane.That affects the balance of the plane".The Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee indicated that Lion Air flight 610 experienced "erroneous input" from one of its sensors designed to alert pilots if the aeroplane is at risk of stalling.The inquiry has not yet reached any final conclusions about the cause of the disaster.The sensor and connected software work in a different way to previous models of the 737, but pilots had not been told that.Within days of the Lion Air crash, the aircraft maker Boeing issued an operations bulletin to airlines.The US aviation regulator then issued an "emergency" airworthiness directive to US carriers about this sensor - a so-called Angle of Attack (AOA) sensor.The Federal Aviation Administration said the sensor "condition, if not addressed, could cause the flight crew to have difficulty controlling the airplane, and lead to excessive nose-down attitude, significant altitude loss, and possible impact with terrain".Who was sent the emergency alert?US airlines were told to update information flight manuals for air crew.At the time the FAA said the information was passed on to other national aviation regulators.The expectation was that regulators would inform airlines and they in turn would update pilots.Aviation sources say it almost certain that Ethiopian Airlines pilots would have been updated on the sensor issue.There is no immediate evidence to suggest the Ethiopia Airlines jet has encountered the same difficulties as the Lion Air flight.Aviation analyst John Strickland of JLS Consulting told the BBC: "There will be attention to the fact that this was a very new aircraft, the same type as that involved in the recent Lion Air accident and in a similar phase of flight - but detailed work taking time will be required to establish the cause."What's Boeing's response?In a statement on Sunday, Boeing said a "technical team is prepared to provide technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the US National Transportation Safety Board".It has also said it extended its "heartfelt sympathies to the families and loved ones of the passengers and crew on board and stand ready to support the Ethiopian Airlines team".The Boeing 737 Max has been the fastest-selling aircraft in Boeing's history, with more than 4,500 ordered by 100 different operators globally.The initial findings of the investigation in Ethiopia will determine what action regulators and airlines take.Ethiopian Airlines is regarded as Africa's leading airline.Analyst John Strickland said it is "also recognised globally as a high-quality professionally-run company".
Wonky spud vodka couple eye export market:::::Image caption Graeme and Caroline Jarron reckon there is demand for their vodka overseas A potato-farming couple who make vodka using spuds which are too "wonky" to sell in supermarkets are planning to sell their product across the globe.Caroline and Graeme Jarron have been distilling Ogilvy Vodka at their Angus farm since 2014.They have found it tough selling in the UK, but believe there could be big demand for their product in places like the US and Middle East.The couple have also opened a 150,000 vodka visitor centre at their farm.Now, they are driving forward plans to take their product global."We're actively looking at opportunities in the Middle East and in America," Caroline told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme."I think there's some big vodka-drinking markets globally, the trend being gin in the UK at the moment so that's been a tougher market for us."We are up against the mainstream vodkas and that's quite tough for us in terms of pricing - we're a lot more expensive to produce our vodka."Caroline said making the first batch of vodka for sale came at the end of a long process."We have potatoes that we sell to supermarkets, but there's the wonky ones - the ones that are too big, too small, a bit ugly," she said."We didn't know what to do with those ones so it was frustration with that and trying to find a use for them that led us to this."Image copyright Photographer: Jakub Iwanicki Image caption The vodka is made using misshapen potatoes that would not normally make it onto supermarket shelves The wife and husband team first worked with Heriot-Watt University's brewing and distilling department."Graeme drove down week after week with sacks of potatoes and they took it on as a bit of a test project," said Caroline.They then spent another seven months perfecting the process, before settling on Maris Piper as the perfect potato with which to make vodka.Scotland's spirits industry is best-known for making whisky, while the number of gin producers has been growing steadily."We've gone against the trend, but tried to do something a bit different to stand out from the crowd," said Caroline."There has been this big boom in gin - but a lot of them buy in the base spirit.We grow the potatoes, we distil it and we bottle it all on the farm ourselves."Graeme and Caroline are also hoping their new visitor centre will attract 3,000 people in its first year, by providing a behind-the-scenes look at how a potato vodka distillery works."A lot of people approached us to see if we do tours, and we haven't had the facility to do it up until know," said Caroline."We are something different.We're not whisky, we're not gin.People are really keen to see how we produce it."For more on this story and the latest business news as it happens, follow BBC presenter Andrew Black's updates each weekday morning on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme between 0600 and 0900.
