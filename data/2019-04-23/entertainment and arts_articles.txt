Hollywood earns lowest Easter weekend box office in almost 15 years: report:::::As we were the first to say yesterday very early in the morning, its the lowest Easter weekend at the box office in well over a decade actually, since 2003, per ComScore this morning (when it hit $107.1M), with the last three days totaling $110.8M in US/Canada ticket sales.This despite the fact that New Lines $9M James Wan horror production, "The Curse of La Llorona," over-performed and kicked its $15M-$17M tracking to the tune of $26.5M.This weekends domestic B.O.is also off 12% from the comparative three-day frame a year ago ($125.55M), which was also the pre-period prior to "Avengers: Infinity War" debuting.All of this speaks to the power of "Avengers: Endgame," or specifically, a hands-down, must-see Marvel movie on the calendar: no major studio wants to program a tentpole and spend a $100M-plus global P&A to launch a movie in the weekend preceding a Marvel movie, even if its during a lucrative holiday period at the box office.At least thats the attitude this year."BREAKTHROUGH" IMPACTED "THIS IS US" STAR CHRISSY METZ'S OWN FAITH True, folks may curb their movie ticket spending at the B.O.in the weekend prior to a Marvel or Star Wars movie, but cmon its Easter weekend, and three-quarters of the nations K-12 schools were on break.Previous Easter weekends, when "Furious 7" and "Batman v. Superman" played, have amassed north of $224M.Not to mention, studios have proven before that two tentpoles, launched next to each other in subsequent weekends, can live in the marketplace at the same time.Surely among some in the industry and exhibition, theres a So what?attitude about this weekend at the B.O.: Next weekend will probably deliver one of the biggest thee-days of all-time at the domestic box office with "Endgame."Nonetheless, the 2019 domestic box office according to ComScore still lags greatly behind last year at -16% with $2.9 billion through today, a difference of $568M."Endgame" isnt going to fix that gaping hole in just one weekend of its opening; it could take well into June before we make up that difference.Much of this has to do with how pics were dated between last year and this year.Then again, there were some movies like Universal/BVIs "Glass" and Foxs "Alita" which didnt work as they were intended to do.Marvel launched "Black Panther" in mid-February last year and amassed $688M by the time when "Avengers: Infinity War" opened.Compare this to "Captain Marvel" which just became the 7th Marvel move to cross $400M in its 45th day of release today.The pic saw a 6% spike in business despite shedding 322 screens as fans prep for "Endgame" next weekend."Captain America: Civil War" took 44 days to hit $400M, "Iron Man 3" reached that threshold in 47 days.Warner Bros. hit the demos they were expecting for "La Llorona" with 49% Hispanic audiences and 30% females under 25, along with 26% men under 25.She played best in the West and South-West, with 17 of the pics top 20 runs coming from these regions.The pic is safe counter-programming at a minimal estimated domestic P&A spend around $35M-$40M, which can be the second choice next weekend when "Avengers: Endgame" potentially sets another opening weekend record, beating Infinity Wars $257.6M.'UNPLANNED' STAR ASHLEY BRATCHER SAYS 'IT'S SO INCREDIBLE' HOW MOVIE IS CHANGING HEARTS AND MINDS ON ABORTION "Llorona" also didnt ding New Lines own "Shazam!"that much.In his third weekend, that film is expected to gross $17.3M, a very sweet -29% hold in second place at 4,183 theaters.CinemaScore audiences gave "Llorona" a B-, which is less than both "Annabelles" Bs and higher than "The Nuns" C. PostTrak gave the pic a low 2 1/2 stars and a 48% definite recommend.Friday made $11.8M (including $2.75M Thursday night previews), and the Michael Chaves-directed movie was frontloaded with a Saturday that was down 26% with $8.7M.The 13-17 set who were able to get into "Llorona" liked the movie the most at 79% positive, but they only repped 12% of the crowd.Caucasians came out at 27%, African Americans at 11%, and Asians at 8%.Says social media analytics corp RelishMix about "Llorona," There are a lot of fans sharing stories of this legend and how it was an integral part of their childhood, with some being told by friends, others by their Grandma the point is its seen as a legend that just might be true.That said, James Wans contribution and the scary clips from the film have horror fans convinced this effort is worth seeing in theaters.Another element that fans like is that the movie is rated R, which many horror fans see as a good sign.One of the best things "La Llorona" has going for it is the simple suggestion or rumor that it might be related to the "Conjuring" universe."Llorona" is not directly connected to "Conjuring," as it doesnt involve, nor is it connected to, the paranormal investigators, the Warrens.RelishMix considers "Lloronas" social media universe at over 137M very strong for a horror genre.Broken out, thats 33.8M Facebook Fans, 14M Facebook video views, 9.2M Twitter Followers, 66.1M YouTube views and 14M Instagram followers.Video materials both organic and bought are at 44:1, well above the typical horror films 25:1 viral rate.Similarly, the average daily views for Lloronas top YouTube clips are coming in at 50.3K, once again exceeding the benchmark of 27.7K for the genre.Notable "Llorona" materials on social, per RelishMix, include a number of YouTube influencer clips sponsored by Warner Bros.The Buzzfeed Unsolved Network posted a clip that was 24 minutes long and earned 3.3M views, which called out the movie in the description to the Channels 2.4M subscribers.Similarly, there are fan-posted clips about the "Llorona" legend, which have clocked well over 1M views.This campaign has featured a real push and pull from sponsored WB clips and organic videos from fans, which is clearly driving the high YT views heading towards open.In addition, there was this clip from Glam & Gore (which counts 3.5M subscribers) that features a makeup tutorial and a look at the film, followed by the host trying not to cry and ruin the makeup.Disney/Foxs faith-based "Breakthrough" drew $11.1M over the 3-day and $14.6Msince its Wednesday opening at 2,824.While thats slightly lower than the $14.8M 3-day and $18.3M made by DeVon Franklins "Miracles From Heaven," its not a disaster of the pics estimated $14M production cost.These faith-based titles have a home entertainment life for their demos.As typical with faith-based films, they earn great exits based on their demos, and PostTrak shows 49% females over 25 being the dominant quad, and 51% over 35, with an overall 4 1/2 stars and a very notable 69% definite recommend.Overall audience diversity breakdown was 48% Caucasian, 28% Hispanic, 15% African American, & 9% Asian/Other.Breakthrough played strong in the Mid-West and South, with the top 10 theaters in that area.Missouri and Tennessee had seven of the top ten runs.Meanwhile, anti-abortion film "Unplanned" from PureFlix in its fourth weekend made $650K off 839 theaters for a running $17.2M cumulative.RelishMix says that the social media universe for "Breakthrough" is exceptional at 161.5M across Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter, with positive word of mouth into the weekend from the faith-based crowd.For context, the next largest SMU RelishMix has seen in recent history for a faith-based pic was for 2017s "The Shack" at 89.4M.Big social media movers here for the film are "This Is Us" star Chrissy Metz with 1.7M, who is pushing a 7:30pm free screening at the Burbank, CA AMC 16 today.The campaign also benefited from Metzs duet with Carrie Underwood at the Country Music Awards last Sunday of Im Standing With You, which has added 11 clips to its social media push.the earned bucket of social media.While its common to have a film support a live broadcast to build awareness, its such a bonus to have one of the movies stars actually perform there and reap the benefits on social.Universals "Little" in its second weekend eased -45% with $8.45M and a 10-day take of $29.3M.Disneynatures "Penguins" plopped outside the top 10 in the No.12 spot with around $2.3Mover three days and $3.3M for the five days at 1,815.Even though much isnt expected from these nature docs at the B.O."Penguins" is the worst opening for a Disneynature doc ever.2012 "Chimpanzees" $10.6M posted the biggest three-day in the nature canon, and the previous low before "Penguins" was "Monkey Kingdom" at $4.5M in 2015.The last Disneynature movie to open over 5-days was "Penguins" co-director Alastair Fothergills "Earth" in April 2009 which posted a $8.8M FSS at 1,804 theaters and a $14.4M five-day opening.As we mentioned the pic nabbed an A CinemaScore, however PostTrak exits were moderate at 78% positive and a 52% definite recommend from the general audience while kids under 12 gave it a 77% positive and 60% definite recommend.Fridays gross was around $900K.Not that much is ever expected from these nature docs at the box office; theres goodwill vibe to these big-screen presentations.Those who showed up to "Penguins" were 55% female with 52% under 25 and 35% under 17.Diversity demos were comprised of 63% Caucasian, 23% Hispanic, 11% Asian/Other, and 3% African American.Bleecker Streets expansion of "Teen Spirit" from 4 to 696 theaters earned an estimated $250,5K in weekend 2 for a running total of $305,3K."It Follows" director David Robert Mitchell has the comedy crime drama "Under the Silver" Lake from A24 at two locations and it minted a theater average of $20K or $40K over three days.Starring Andrew Garfield, Riley Keough and Topher Grace, pic follows a guy (Garfield) who meets a mysterious woman in his apartments swimming pool.She disappears and he embarks on a quest to find her across Los Angeles.Rotten Tomatoes is 53% Rotten.NY and LA runs were at the Angelika & ArcLight Hollywood.At the latter, the pic was the top grossing

Cuban indie artists challenge government at Havana arts biennial:::::HAVANA (Reuters) - A blustering bureaucrat fills a form out with your personal details and hands you a badge declaring you an inspector qualified to police Communist-run Cubas cultural sector under a controversial new decree.Cuban artist Leandro Feal holds a badge reading "Authority invested with power to inspect and recognize contraventions laid out in decree and impose pertinent measures", during the 13th Biennial in Havana, Cuba April 15, 2019.Picture taken April 15, 2019.REUTERS/Sarah Marsh This interactive performance by Cuban artist Leandro Feal, 33, is one of the politically charged artworks in a parallel exhibit on the sidelines of Havanas 13th Biennial arts celebration that kicked off this weekend.The exhibit underscores both simmering tensions in Cubas arts scene and artists growing independence from the state, which has dominated all aspects of society since the 1959 revolution, including promoting culture.The official biennial program of more than 300 works by artists from 52 countries is taking over Havanas museums, galleries and open spaces, including its seafront, until May 12.Meanwhile, the parallel program of exhibits is sprawling - often in private studios and galleries - and reaches into the most remote neighborhoods.The growth of tourism and the private sector over the past decade, as well as greater freedom to travel and Internet access, have enabled artists to work more independently of state institutions.While most of these exhibits are not explicitly political, artists say the greater independence allows them to address politically sensitive issues more freely.The biennial at the end of the day is a kind of mirror of Cuban society where the independent scene is growing, said Abel Gonzalez Fernandez, 27, curator of the group show that includes Feals performance and works by some of Cubas top young artists, like Reynier Leyva Novo.Some say Cubas cultural institutions are ideologically outdated and too strapped for cash to promote them sufficiently.The so-called biennial, impressive as it is, was last held four years ago.Gonzalez Fernandez and others believe the government last year introduced Decree 349 partly to rein them in.It gives inspectors the right to shut down exhibits and performances deemed to violate Cubas revolutionary values.The government says the legislation targets offensive and mediocre content.But it agreed in December to revise the accompanying regulations after broad outcry, and since then, it has not expressed itself again on the topic.They tried to impose a moratorium on the topic, but we have artists who are getting imprisoned, said Feal.Self-proclaimed artivist Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, who led a vocal campaign against Decree 349, was arrested on Friday after staging a small but politically charged performance in his neighborhood.In the show, competitors carrying the flag of Cubas old-time foe, the United States, ran a race, in homage to the Cuban who interrupted Havanas mass May Day march in 2017 by running in front of it waving the Stars and Stripes.Otero Alcantara told Reuters he had been briefly detained a week earlier and warned not to stage his planned performance.He was released on Monday.Rights groups say Cuba often uses short-term detentions to repress public criticism.Asked by Reuters about the arrest, the head of Cubas National Council of Visual Arts, Norma Rodriguez, said at a news conference: As far as I know he is an activist, not an artist.Cuba considers dissidents to be mercenaries in the pay of the United States trying to subvert the government.A few other artists who have protested Decree 349 say they have also been harassed by authorities.Some supporters of the Cuban government accuse activist artists of trying to boost their cachet or get offered asylum through altercations with the state.A top cultural official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Decree 349 had nothing to do with the biennial and described it as an inclusive event showing the work of several artists who had publicly criticized it.Cuban artist Kiki Faxas holds a badge from fellow artist Leandro Feal (not pictured) as Cuba's late President Fidel Castro is seen on a television screen as part of Faxa's installation, during the 13th Biennial arts celebration in Havana, Cuba April 15, 2019.Picture taken April 15, 2019.REUTERS/Sarah Marsh Cuban artists who are critical of the government have often used the biennial - which attracts international collectors, gallery owners and critics - to raise awareness of the restraints on freedom of expression in Cuba.We are testing the limits of whats possible, said Gonzalez Fernandez.Tania Bruguera, one of Cubas most famous living artists, who has had frequent run-ins with authorities, said she would not participate in this years biennial because the government was using it to clean its international image in the wake of the campaign against Decree 349.
Notre-Dame's famed rose window spared but blaze harms priceless artworks:::::PARIS (Reuters) - Four-hundred-year-old paintings hung high inside Notre-Dame were damaged by the immense fire that engulfed the Paris cathedral, but emergency workers formed a human chain to whisk gem-studded chalices and other priceless artefacts out of harms way.FILE PHOTO: View of the north rose window (rosace) of Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral in Paris October 18, 2012.REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo Notre-Dames famed stained-glass rose windows and most of its many religious relics appeared to have escaped the worst of Mondays inferno as well, easing fears for the fate of the vast trove of artworks in the 800-year-old gothic cathedral.Among the most cherished articles to make it out unscathed was the Sainte Couronne (holy crown), made of braided reed brought to France from Constantinople in the 12th century.Though lacking its original thorns, the crown has been revered as an object of Christian worship for centuries.Gold, silver and gem-inlaid chalices, candelabras and many other artefacts survived the blaze thanks to quick-thinking firefighters, police and city employees who formed a human chain to move revered artefacts away from the flames.Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo tweeted a picture of heavy-set candlesticks stacked in the safety of nearby Paris City Hall.Art specialists were still poring over the extent of the damage to Notre-Dames 13th-century South Rose Window, measuring 10 meters across (33 feet), and other stained-glass masterpieces still standing after the cathedrals wood-beamed roof collapsed.It seems they have not been destroyed for now, although well have to see what real state theyre in, and whether they can be restored properly, said Maxime Cumunel, secretary general of Frances Observatory for Religious Heritage.We have avoided a complete disaster.But some five to 10 percent of the artwork has probably been destroyed, we have to face up to that, Cumunel said.Four of the largest-scale 17th and 18th century paintings depicting scenes from the lives of the apostles had been damaged, at least in part, he added.Culture Minister Franck Riester said the paintings were mainly affected by smoke damage, rather than by flames.The artworks, which were dampened during the 15-hour battle to douse the blaze, will be removed from Friday and transferred to the Louvre museum, where other objects will also be kept, for attempts at restoration, he added.DAMAGE MAKES ME QUAKE It remained unclear how well the cathedrals towering master organ, embedded into a sculpted wooden casing, had fared, as rescuers remained on high alert for the possibility that some of Notre-Dames fragile vaults might come crashing down.The organ - which survived the French Revolution in the late 18th century, when it was used for recitals of patriotic songs - may have been slightly damaged too, according to Cumunel, though city hall officials said it was largely intact.Whats happened is really disturbing and makes me quake, said Veronique Proust, a specialist guide who has led tours of the cathedral and its treasury for a quarter century.For 25 years Ive shown these treasures, the exceptional quality of the stone carvings, now Ive got nothing to show anymore.Most of the sacramental artefacts in Notre-Dames treasury - where they were traditionally kept as reserves to be sold off or melted down in times of need - date from the 19th and 20th centuries.It was not immediately clear how much Notre-Dames treasures were worth, with Riester only pointing to the many years and hundreds of millions of euros of investment that would be required to restore the cathedral.A combined 460 million euros ($520 million) has already been pledged for reconstruction and restoration efforts, led by a 100 million euro donation from Francois-Henri Pinault, billionaire boss of Gucci-owner Kering, and 200 million euros from his rival Bernard Arnault, head of luxury group LVMH.Oil company Total promised 100 million and Paris City Hall a further 50 million.State-owned investment fund Caisse des Depots said it would donate oak timber from the forests it owns to help rebuild the framework under the cathedral roof, which went up in flames.Other relics that made it out of the wreckage included a tunic worn by Saint Louis, a 13th-century king of France, while the cathedrals 13-tonne bell, its largest, which rings sonorously on special occasions like Easter, was spared.Sixteen bronze statues that adorned Notre-Dames collapsed spire - itself a 19th-century restoration - were airlifted out just days before the fire as part of ongoing renovations.A gold cross stood eerily intact above the altar on Tuesday, surrounded by debris - the first images from inside the cathedral that reached the wider world.
AI Robot paints its own moonscapes in traditional Chinese style:::::LONDON (Reuters) - A Hong Kong artist has created an artificial intelligence (AI) robot which creates its own paintings.Victor Wong took three years to build and program the robot called A.I Gemini and teach it artistic techniques.Randomness has been written into its algorithm, meaning Wong does not know what it will paint before it begins.The project is called Far Side of the Moon.The robots AI was fed NASA 3D images of the moon and imagery taken by Chinas Change-4 lunar rover.It captured images of the dark side of the moon in January.A.I Gemini takes an average of 50 hours to create a blend of landscapes on traditional, fresh xuan paper made from bark and rice straw.The average price for a piece on sale in London is 10,000 ($13,000).Wong designed the robot to use the ancient Chinese art of shuimo to create its paintings, using mainly black ink and water.Wong said it felt good to display the work and have people praise it.Asked if work created by robot can be art, Wong added: I think so, at this moment.
Art frenzy takes over Havana as biennial kicks off:::::HAVANA (Reuters) - Cones of white paper sprout from the seasalt-eroded pillars of one colonial building along Havanas seafront, elaborately painted curtains cascade from another while out front children play with an installation of multicolored hoses.A giant photograph of a boy by French photographer and artist JR is seen on a wall, during the 13th Havana Biennial, in Havana, Cuba April 12, 2019.REUTERS/Fernando Medina Havanas 13th Biennial kicked off this weekend with works by more than 300 contemporary artists from 52 countries taking over the citys museums, galleries and open-air spaces, and many more collateral exhibits.They turned my home into an artwork, said Silvia Perez, smiling at the paper sprouting from the colonnade of her home, a piece by Cuban artist Elio Jess Fonseca.The artist said it meant peace.The transformation of the Malecon seafront boulevard into an open-air, interactive gallery, has become one of the most popular venues of Cubas most important arts event.Along the sidewalk this year are smooth boulders encased in volcanic slabs by Mexican artist Jose Davila, while a swirling light installation by Peruvian artist Grimanesa Amoros protudes from a building.Cubas Communist government, which has heavily promoted the arts since the countrys 1959 leftist revolution, created the Havana Biennial in 1984 to promote artists from the developing world, especially Cuban ones.This year, 80 Cubans will exhibit their work, including a performance on Monday by Manuel Mendive, considered the Caribbean islands top living artist.Still, it also includes a large contingent of European and U.S. artists including Cuban-Americans like Enrique Martnez Celaya and Emilio Perez.Biennial Director Jorge Alfonso said it had been a challenge to stage the biennial given Cubas difficult economic situation - authorities postponed it half a year - but that it had succeeded underscored the importance Cuba placed on culture.Not even in the most difficult moments have we ever given up on staging one of these kind of events, he told Reuters.The slogan of this years edition, the construction of the possible, is related to our ideal that a better world is possible.Some artists who are critical of the government however have subverted that slogan.In one piece on the Malecon called Potemkin Village, Cuban-born artist Juan Andres Milanes Benito who lives in Norway has propped what appears to be the perfect facade of a building on another that is falling into disrepair.It fits a lot with the Cuban government these days and how the system is working - there is a lot of facade, he said.Inside it is not so perfect.Originally he had wanted to replicate the facade of a renovated government building but authorities would not allow him, he said.Some Cuban artists feel the Havana Biennial itself is a facade papering over simmering tensions between them and authorities.Artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, who led a campaign against a controversial new decree on the cultural sector last year, was arrested last Friday after staging a small yet politically charged performance in his neighborhood.Slideshow (5 Images) His whereabouts remain unknown, his friends say.Asked by Reuters about the arrest in a news conference, the head of Cubas National Council of Visual Arts, Norma Rodriguez, said as far as I know he is an activist not an artist.Cuba considers dissidents to be mercenaries in the pay of the United States trying to subvert the government.The Havana Biennial runs until May 12.
Artist Ai Weiwei takes aim at state violence in Mexico with Legos:::::MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Chinese artist Ai Weiwei unveiled a new installation in Mexico that tells the story of 43 students likely massacred five years ago in a case that exposed government stonewalling and complicity in abuses, a frequent theme for the dissident artist.The installation features large portraits of the students made from a million multi-colored Legos that hover above a cavernous exhibit space, images that have become seared into the Mexican conscience by grieving family members who often hoist posters with the same images at protests demanding answers for their sons disappearance.Entitled Reestablishing Memories, the work also features a timeline of the 2014 abduction of the trainee-teachers from the all-boys Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers College in southern Mexico and the governments widely disparaged investigation into the case.Why do we have to do it?Because every crime creates a vacuum and it poisons society, Ai told reporters at a news conference on Thursday.Known for his criticism of Communist-run Chinas stifling of free expression, Ai said his latest project was partially inspired by the Chinese governments refusal to explain its errors following a massive 2008 earthquake in Sichuan in which thousands of students died in government-built schools.It reminded me of the Mexicans who lost their children, he said, explaining how his own search for answers following the tragedy was stymied.An initial Mexican government investigation found that the Ayotzinapa students were abducted by corrupt police who handed them over to a local drug gang.The gang then killed them for reasons that remain unclear and burnt their bodies in a trash dump, discarding the ashes into a nearby river, it concluded.But the account was tainted by allegations of torture and the possible involvement of soldiers.To date, the remains of just one student have been identified.Ai, who was detained by the Chinese government in 2011 and currently lives in Berlin, supervised the creation of the oversized Lego portraits by students from Mexicos National Autonomous University (UNAM).Slideshow (9 Images) Last year, Ai accused Lego of refusing to directly sell its interlocking plastic toy bricks to him.The Danish company said its policy was designed to keep it out of politics, but later reversed its stand in the face of a public backlash.Reestablishing Memories, which is paired with Ais earlier Wang Family Ancestral Hall installation, opens on Saturday on the UNAM campus in Mexico City, and will be on display through October.
FBI's 'art cops': In hot pursuit of Renoirs, Rembrandts and ruby slippers:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - When a 17th century Dutch painting looted by the Nazis turned up for sale in New York in late 2017, the FBIs Art Crime Team moved in, verified its identity and helped win a court order to return the work to its rightful owners.FILE PHOTO: A pair of ruby slippers featured in the classic 1939 film The Wizard of Oz and stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota in 2005, is shown after it was recovered in a sting operation conducted in Minneapolis earlier this summer in this FBI Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S., image released on September 4, 2018.Courtesy FBI/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo It was the latest of many high-profile cases for the 22-person Federal Bureau of Investigation division dedicated to solving a wide array of art-related crimes at an agency that is better known for chasing bank robbers, spies and other criminal rogues.Solomon Konincks 17th-century painting A Scholar Sharpening His Quill, was one of many treasures belonging to the family of art collector Adolphe Schloss that were seized by the Nazi-supporting Vichy government in France 75 years ago.The portrait, which once adorned Adolph Hitlers Munich offices, disappeared at the end of World War Two.It resurfaced at Christies auction house, which tipped off the FBI unit last year that a Chilean art dealer was trying to sell it.The evidence was really overwhelming, FBI Special Agent Chris McKeogh said, days after the works formal repatriation to the Schloss heirs in early April.There was really no question that this was the painting in question.In its early days, recalled Robert Wittman, the Art Crime Teams founding chief, being art cops was not exactly a path to directorship.But after 14 years, the team is getting more respect from fellow agents after several headline-grabbing recoveries in the United States of art works and other cultural property, Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter said.People just think what were doing is cool, said Carpenter, who now runs the unit from the FBIs Washington headquarters.I think weve changed a lot of perceptions, even within the organization, he said.So now my phone rings off the hook weekly for folks wanting to be on the team.Since it was founded in 2005, the team has recovered nearly 15,000 objects worth nearly $800 million and secured more than 90 convictions.CHAGALL, RENOIR AND RUBY SLIPPERS Last year alone, its recoveries included a painting by Marc Chagall that had been taken from the Manhattan home of an elderly couple nearly 30 years earlier, a Nazi-looted work by artist Auguste Renoir and a pair of ruby slippers worth millions worn by Judy Garland as Dorothy in the 1939 movie The Wizard of Oz.It is not the money, Carpenter stressed, but rather the intrinsic value of stolen art and cultural property - anything from baseball cards to a $5 million Stradivarius - that determines whether the FBI will pursue it.The red sequined shoes stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Minnesota 13 years ago were a prime example.People responded to that case, he said.They said this is really important; this is a piece of Americana.Agents selected for the team must understand why art and culture matter to humanity, Carpenter said.Agent McKeogh pinpointed his art awakening to a college backpacking trip in Paris.On an obligatory visit to the Mona Lisa at the Louvre, he happened to pass Pierre-Narcisse Guerins 18th-century oil painting The Return of Marcus Sextus.I found a painting that spoke to me and spent about a half-hour sitting in front it, said McKeogh, who is based in New York.And from there, I was really hooked.MOST VEXING UNSOLVED CASE The United States was lagging far behind European countries in art crime-fighting resources when Wittman helped launch the team in 2005, partly to track down antiquities that were looted from the Baghdad Museum after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.Now a private consultant, Wittman was the bureaus original art sleuth.He said art thieves were always most vulnerable when they tried to unload their high-profile, ill-gotten gains.The real art in art heists is not the stealing, its the selling, said Wittman, who had recovered more than $300 million in stolen art when he retired in 2008 after 20 years.While there are no reliable statistics on art crime, Carpenter said he thinks technology is making things worse because stolen works and forgeries can be sold anonymously on online marketplaces.If the Art Crime Teams most vexing case is a daring 1990 heist at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in which thieves made off with 13 pieces by Dutch masters Rembrandt and Vermeer and other artists worth half a billion dollars.Despite a $10 million reward, none of them has been recovered, and the theft, considered to be among the biggest in art history, looms as the teams most glaring unsolved case.Theres not a single person on the Art Crime Team that doesnt dream of the day that we can recover those pieces, said Carpenter.
Florence study proves artist Leonardo da Vinci was ambidextrous:::::FLORENCE, Italy (Reuters) - An in-depth study of Leonardo da Vincis earliest-known drawing has proved that the great Renaissance artist was ambidextrous, Italys Uffizi Gallery said on Monday.The scientific and technological analysis also revealed a hidden, previously unknown landscape sketch, also by Leonardo, on the back of the original work.It is a real revolution in the field of Leonardo studies, said Uffizi director, Eike Schmidt.The findings were announced a month ahead of the 500th anniversary of the death of Leonardo, with museums around Europe organizing exhibitions and events to celebrate the life of the man responsible for such masterpieces as Mona Lisa.His first-known drawing is dated Aug. 5, 1473 when Leonardo was 21 and shows a landscape of the Arno river valley and Montelupo Castle, just outside Florence.Commonly known as Landscape 8P from its inventory number, the work has words on the front going from right to left, as Leonardo often used to write, which gives the date.On the back, the brief script goes from left to right, and alludes to an informal contract.A study of the two texts confirmed they were both written by Leonardo and showed he was able to write perfectly using both his left and right hand.Leonardo was born left-handed, but was taught to write with his right hand from a very young age, said art historian Cecilia Frosinini.By looking at his writings, including from this drawing, one can see his right-handed calligraphy is educated and well done.Slideshow (11 Images) Using infrared light, the art experts also discovered two different layers of drawing, both on the back and front, with an ink line covering the original charcoal trace in certain places.Not much ink is visible on the back, but the infrared revealed that another landscape depicting a river crossed by a bridge was originally drawn there using a type of charcoal.It was not clear if the artist had rubbed the paper clean or if the charcoal had simply faded over time.The elements that emerged during this research open up new perspectives on the interpretation of Leonardos Landscape 8P and on how the artist (built) the landscape, on his technique and even on his habits and abilities in writing, Schmidt said.
Finely painted Ptolemaic tomb unveiled in Egypt:::::SOHAG, Egypt (Reuters) - Archaeologists on Friday unveiled a well preserved and finely painted tomb thought to be from the early Ptolemaic period near the Egyptian town of Sohag.Two mummies, of a woman and child, are on display at the newly discovered burial site, the Tomb of Tutu, at al-Dayabat, Sohag, Egypt April 5, 2019.REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany The tomb was built for a man named Tutu and his wife, and is one of seven discovered in the area last October, when authorities found smugglers digging illegally for artefacts, officials said.Its painted walls depict funeral processions and images of the owner working in the fields, as well as his family genealogy written in hieroglyphics.Mostafa Waziri, secretary-general of Egypts Supreme Council of Antiquities, described the burial chamber as a beautiful, colorful tomb.The tomb is made up of a central lobby, and a burial room with two stone coffins.The lobby is divided in two, he said.It shows images of the owner of the burial room, Tutu, giving and receiving gifts before different gods and goddesses.We see the same thing for his wife, Ta-Shirit-Iziz, with the difference that (we see) verses from a book, the book of the afterlife, he added.Two mummies, a woman aged between 35-50 and a boy aged 12-14, were on display outside the shallow burial chamber, in a desert area near the Nile about 390 km (242 miles) south of Cairo.Around 50 mummified animals, including mice and falcons, were also recovered from the tomb.Ptolemaic rule spanned about three centuries until the Roman conquest in 30 B.C.Egypts ancient sites are a draw for tourists and authorities hope new finds can help boost the sector, which has been recovering after foreigners were scared off by the North African countrys 2011 popular uprising and the turmoil and insecurity that followed.
Germany's new Bauhaus museum set for interactive opening:::::BERLIN (Reuters) - The new Bauhaus museum opens its doors to the public for the first time in the east German city of Weimar on Saturday after three years of construction, giving admirers of the world-famous form follows function aesthetic a new place of pilgrimage.An inauguration weekend, with free entry and various concerts and spectacles, will mark the peak of a year during which hundreds of events across Germany are commemorating the 100th birthday of the Bauhaus movement, associated with clean and functional design.Bauhaus has influenced design all over the world, said Ulrike Bestgen, the museums director, adding that Bauhaus pioneers dealt with urgent issues of their times, like housing shortages which are still relevant today.Three light and sound installations are set to interact with the new building, which, designed in white and gray by Berlin architect and long-time Bauhaus teacher Heike Hanada, itself recalls the minimalist sobriety of the original style.The school began in 1919 in the aftermath of World War One.Bauhaus - German for building house - pioneered a new restraint as a reaction against the decorative frills of the pre-war era that now seemed frivolous.The art school later moved from Weimar to Dessau, also in the east, where - once Hitlers Nazis moved into the local townhall - the Bauhaus was shut down.That was in 1933, the year in which Hitler came to power, bringing an end to the Weimar Republic, a short period of democracy between two World Wars in Germany which also started in 1919 and, like Weimars Bauhaus school, ended 14 years later.
Hemingway center opens in Cuba to preserve writer's work:::::SAN FRANCISCO DE PAULA, Cuba (Reuters) - A restoration center to preserve the work of Ernest Hemingway opened in Cuba on Saturday, highlighting an area of cooperation with the United States even as bilateral ties between the old Cold War foes have chilled again.A view of the Ernest Hemingway Museum during a visit of U.S.Congressman James Mcgovern (not pictured) in Havana, Cuba, March 30, 2019.REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini Hemingway, who won the Nobel prize for Literature in 1954, wrote some of his greatest books during the 21 years he lived at Finca Vigia, or Lookout Farm, now a museum in San Francisco de Paula on the outskirts of Havana.The restoration center built by the Cuban National Cultural Heritage Council and Finca Vigia Foundation of the United States is located on the 15-acre (6-hectare) property where Hemingway lived in a tree-shaded, airy Spanish-style home.When we come together, when we work together, we can do positive and amazing things, Jim McGovern, a U.S. congressman for Massachusetts who wants better U.S.-Cuban relations, said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony.McGovern said the project would have been much easier were it not for the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, that President Donald Trump has tightened since coming to power.Hemingway moved to Finca Vigia in 1939, the year before For Whom the Bell Tolls was published, and wrote The Old Man and the Sea, A Moveable Feast and Islands in the Stream while he was there, according to local scholars.He left Cuba in 1960, more than a year after the Cuban revolution and less than a year before he killed himself in Idaho at age 61 amid a struggle with depression.The writer left thousands of documents in Cuba, ranging from manuscripts of some of his works to letters, as well as photographs and annotated books.The restoration center, which received financing from the Ford Foundation, American Express Philanthropy and the AT&T Foundation amongst others, includes laboratories and an air-conditioned vault.The Cuban National Cultural Heritage Council and Finca Vigia Foundation had previously signed three cooperation agreements to conserve and disseminate the legacy of Hemingway.
Italy's Pompeii offers new glimpses of life before calamity:::::POMPEII, Italy (Reuters) - Nearly 2,000 years after Pompeii was destroyed by a volcanic eruption, the ancient Roman city is still giving up its long-buried secrets.Fantastic frescos, preserved mosaics and obscene graffiti are just some of the discoveries emerging from the largest archaeological dig at the site since the 1950s.As teams of construction workers shore up mounds of earth pressing down on the excavated areas to prevent them crushing the ruins, archaeologists and conservationists are busy restoring newly discovered art and bolstering fragile walls.The burst of activity marks the final stages of the Great Pompeii Project, launched in 2012 after a spate of cave-ins, with the European Union and Italian state handing over 105 million euros ($118 million) to halt the decay.The risk of collapse, of serious damage is past.Now Pompeii is quite safe, said Francesco Muscolino, 42, an archaeologist working on the program.The extensive conservation work has enabled scholars to uncover a few more areas of Pompeii still buried under volcanic debris, including two large houses, alleyways, highly decorated interiors and a brightly colored snack bar.Pompeii was submerged by volcanic ash when Mount Vesuvius exploded in AD 79, killing thousands of Romans who had no idea they were living beneath one of Europes biggest volcanoes.Memory of the catastrophe faded over time and it was not until 1748 that any meaningful exploration was undertaken.More systematic excavations were launched the following century, but by the end of the 20th century, neglect, lack of funds and repeated flooding were taking a heavy toll.In 2010, less than 15 percent of the excavated area was accessible to tourists, wild dogs roamed the paved streets, and only 10 buildings were open, against 64 in 1956.Today, around 70 percent of the uncovered city is accessible and more than 30 fully restored buildings can be visited.A view of the ancient archaeological site of Pompeii, Italy March 27, 2019.REUTERS/Ciro De Luca CHARCOAL INSCRIPTION The improved access has helped lift tourist numbers, with some 3.5 million people coming to Pompeii last year, an increase of one million in just a decade.Even more visitors are expected as the latest finds are gradually unveiled to the public.Among the highlights are a fresco of the Greek mythological figure Narcissus leaning languidly on a block of stone and staring down at his own reflection in a pool of water.In the same house, archaeologists found a small, exquisite wall painting portraying the seduction of the Spartan queen Leda by the Greek God Zeus, disguised as a swan.It was wonderful because it is very beautiful and in very good condition, said Stefania Giudice, one of the conservationists tasked with preserving the new discoveries.The frescos bright colors have already faded since the ash and pumice were painstakingly removed last year as moisture on the surface of the wall dried out, dulling the rich tones.We will clean it and protect it and get the beautiful colors back, Giudice said, predicting that the fresco-rich house, still partially buried, would be opened to the public within one or two years as new tourist routes were laid out.Elsewhere, some graffiti contains graphic sexual references.Perhaps one of the most significant finds was the least spectacular at first sight - a brief charcoal inscription which cites the date Oct. 17 written in the hallway of a grand house where at least six bodies were also discovered.Archaeologists believe the faint note might have been written just before the eruption, meaning the disaster probably struck two months later than previously thought.Muscolino predicted it would take many years for scholars to assimilate and interpret all the material recovered in recent months, with trays of delicate glass, fresco fragments, plaster moldings, coins and amphora stored away for future research.More than 270 years after the first serious excavations began, a third of the city, which covers roughly 165 acres (66.77 hectares), remains buried and unexplored.Slideshow (7 Images) But there are no plans for further, major digs after this latest project ends, with the emphasis now on conservation.Excavations are like having children.You have to take care of them.You cant just abandon what you find and move on to the next thing, said Giudice.It is a real responsibility.($1 = 0.8909 euros)
Botticelli painting revealed under century of varnish:::::LONDON (Reuters) - British art restorers working on a painting long thought to be a later imitation of a Sandro Botticelli masterpiece have found it in fact came from the Italian renaissance artists own workshop.English Heritage said on Thursday its conservators made the discovery while removing layers of aging varnish from the Madonna della Melagrana (Madonna of the Pomegranate), which shows the mother of Christ holding both her child and the fruit.I noticed instantly that the painting bore a striking resemblance to the workshop of Botticelli himself.Stylistically, it was too similar to be an imitation, it was of the right period, it was technically correct and it was painted on poplar, a material commonly used at the time, said English Heritage senior conservator Rachel Turnbull.To see these colors come out under these layers of later restoration, it was just a wonderful experience, she told BBC radio.The experts used X-ray and infra-red examination to reveal drawing underneath, including changes to the original lines, which provided clues to its real identity.It is the closest version of the 15th century painters original masterpiece, which sits in Florences Uffizi gallery.Famous for paintings like The Birth of Venus and Primavera, Botticelli commonly made copies of his own work to sell to those who liked a painting they had seen elsewhere.Part of the collection amassed by 19th century diamond magnate Julius Wernher, the restored painting will go on display at Londons Rangers House gallery on April 1.
Surrealist artist Man Ray's tomb vandalized in Paris:::::A view shows the desecrated tomb of American-born surrealist artist Man Ray and his wife in the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, France, March 28, 2019.REUTERS/Charles Platiau PARIS (Reuters) - A man has been arrested after the tomb of American-born surrealist artist Man Ray was desecrated in Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, a city official said on Thursday.Born into a family of Russian Jewish immigrants in 1890, Man Ray spent much of his career in the French capital and was close to dada and surrealist artists such as Salvador Dali and Marcel Duchamp in the 1920s and 1930s.The mans motives were unclear, a spokeswoman for Paris City Hall said, adding that early investigations indicated he was homeless and drunk when police arrested him on Tuesday as he was damaging another nearby tomb.A headstone added to the tomb after Man Rays wife died was also knocked down.Man Ray is best known for Ingress Violin, a nude print in which he transformed the naked back of his muse, singer Kiki de Montparnasse, into a violin.Man Ray, who was named Emmanuel Radnitzky at birth, fled to the United States from France during World War Two.He returned to Paris in the early 1950s where he lived until his death in 1976.France has seen a spate of vandalism at Jewish cemeteries and memorials amid concern about rising anti-Semitism in France, home to the largest Jewish community in Europe, although there was no indication that this incident was linked to anti-Semitism.Montparnasse Cemetery contains the graves of other well known people, including philosopher and playwright Jean-Paul Sartre, and writers Simone de Beauvoir and Charles Baudelaire.
Qatar's 'desert rose' museum opens at last:::::DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar on Thursday will open the doors to one of its most lavish cultural projects yet, a sweeping national museum designed by French architect Jean Nouvel that lays out the tiny Gulf states origin story and gas-powered rise to riches.Desert oryxes are seen on display at Qatar National Museum, in Doha, Qatar March 27, 2019.REUTERS/Ibraheem al Omari The museum is the latest move in Dohas campaign for regional dominance in arts and culture that has seen big-ticket acquisitions, new galleries, film festivals and international exhibitions by artists like Damien Hirst and Richard Serra.Qatari officials declined to disclose the cost of building the museum, which includes 52,000 square meters of winding floor space, an artificial lagoon, and the restored palace of Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani, who ruled until 1949.Set along the Doha seaside and over a decade in the making, the museums exterior is a tangle of massive interlocking discs that evoke the shape of a desert rose, a design Nouvel said was a big technical challenge.It creates a variation of space and unexpected spaces and unexpected proportions.I think the visitor will be surprised, Nouvel said at an event on Wednesday to mark the opening.The interior features walls splashed with looping videos on Qatars desert life and pearl diving in past eras, plus digital archives about life under Ottoman and British rule.Its unveiling comes amid a protracted diplomatic and political boycott launched in mid-2017 by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Egypt.The bloc accuses Qatar of supporting terrorism, a charge Doha denies.The blockade has not affected us one bit, Qatar museums chairperson Sheikha Al Mayassa Al Thani said.All people are welcome to this museum and we remain open to the rest of the world and we remain open to dialogue.Nouvel designed rival United Arab Emirates Louvre Abu Dhabi, which opened in 2017 with more than 600 art works from around the world as part of that countrys own efforts to burnish its regional culture credentials.Sheikha Mayassa, sister of the ruling emir, is considered one of the worlds most important art buyers after making a string of high-price acquisitions in the years before Qatar was hit by an energy price slump in 2014.
Etruscan tomb in Corsica may yield secrets on civilization's decline:::::An archaeologist works in an Etruscan tomb containing a skeleton and dozens of objects in Aleria, in the east of the French Mediterranean island of Corsica, in this picture provided by INRAP (Institut National de Recherches Archeologique Preventives) on March 27, 2019.Denis Gliksman/Inrap/HANDOUT via Reuters ALERIA, Corsica (Reuters) - French archaeologists have unearthed an Etruscan tomb containing a skeleton and dozens of artefacts in Corsica, a rare discovery that could shed new light on the wealthy civilization of northern Italy and its assimilation into the Roman Empire.The archaeologists found the vault, chiselled into the rock and dating back to the fourth century B.C., within a large Roman necropolis containing thousands of tombs in Aleria, in the east of the French Mediterranean island.The Etruscans originated in Tuscany during the Bronze Age in around 900 B.C.and left little written trace of their culture.Their decline was gradual and the last Etruscan cities were absorbed by Rome around 100 B.C.The discovery, announced this week, could yield new details on the existence of a stable Etruscan population in Corsica and help archaeologists understand the slow demise of the Etruscan civilization.Its the missing link which will allow us to piece together Etruscan funerary rites, but it also reinforces the hypothesis that before the Roman conquest (in -259 B.C), Aleria was a transit point in the Tyrrhenian Sea, blending Etruscan, Carthaginian and Phocaean interests, head curator Franck Leandri said.The grave appears to belong to a high-ranking official, holding about 15 ceramic vases similar to Etruscan pieces and what appears to be a mirror or the lid of a casing, anthropologist Catherine Rigeade said at the site.We have some knowledge of Etruscan objects, but we know very little about Etruscan subjects; here we have both, Rigeade added.Close to the tomb, archaeologists discovered a gold signet ring bearing almost no trace of time.On it, a feminine face, possibly depicting the goddess Aphrodite, can be made out.The researchers will now focus on accessing the skeleton, which is covered with collapsed furniture apart from its skull.They plan to call in forensic scientists to help reveal the secrets of the remains.
Dutch art sleuth says he has recovered stolen Picasso:::::AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A prominent Dutch art detective says he has helped recover a painting by Pablo Picasso that was stolen from a private Saudi owners yacht in France in 1999.In an interview with broadcaster RTL, Arthur Brand said he was passed in confidence the 1938 Buste de Femme, which portrays Picassos fellow artist and lover Dora Maar.You fear that it will be fake, but when I had it in my hands, I knew right away: this is real, he said.Having received the painting in black trash bags at his house, Brand said he contacted police and handed it to an insurance company for possible return to its owner.I had it hanging in my house for one night, he said, estimating its value at 25 million euros ($28 million) .That was exciting ... Its fantastic, so unbelievably beautiful.Brand said he had first heard the painting was in the Netherlands in 2015.He told the broadcaster he believes it may have been traded back and forth 20 times in the Amsterdam underworld, used as collateral in drugs and weapons deals.He said the final owner was a real estate agent who wanted to be rid of it after he realized it was stolen.Brand said two men contacted him and arranged the drop-off at his house.Dutch police told local media they were not taking further action, as the painting has been returned and the statute of limitations in the 1999 theft has expired.The owner, identified as Saudi businessman Abdulmohsen Abdulmalik Al al-Sheikh, could not immediately be reached for comment.
India to auction fugitive billionaire's art collection:::::MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian tax authorities are hoping for a windfall with the auction on Tuesday of rare oil paintings that were once part of fugitive billionaire jeweler Nirav Modis collection and have been seized by the government.A journalist takes photos of artworks once part of billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi's collection ahead of their auction at a gallery in Mumbai, India, March 25, 2019.REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui Auctioneers say the sale is the first of its kind in a country where tax authorities have usually auctioned property, gold and luxury items, but not art.After a court order allowing the auction to take place, tax authorities, who are pursuing Modi over the countrys largest bank fraud, appointed professional auction house Saffronart.The sale in Mumbai of some 68 works is expected to fetch anywhere between 300 million and 500 million rupees ($4.4 million-$7.3 million).Until a few years ago, the tax authorities really didnt know the value of art, said Farah Siddiqui, an art adviser who is advising clients eyeing Modis collection.The 48-year-old Modi, whose diamonds have sparkled on Hollywood stars, is one of the prime accused in a $2 billion loan fraud at state-run Punjab National Bank.Modi denies the charges and believes they are politically motivated.The auction comes just weeks before a national election and as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces pressure to bring back Nirav Modi (no relation), who fled the country last year and has been residing in the United Kingdom.He was arrested last week by British authorities and remanded in custody after he appeared before a London court.India asked Britain last August to extradite Modi.The auction includes works by Raja Ravi Varma, a 19th century painter considered among Indias finest, and V.S.Gaitonde, a modern artist known for his abstract and often monochromatic paintings.We believe that the collections intrinsic value will garner a positive response from collectors, said Saffronart Chief Executive Dinesh Vazirani.India Law Alliance, a law firm representing the company controlled by Modi that owns the artwork, said it was challenging the court order that allowed the auction.The case will be heard by the Bombay High Court on Wednesday, a lawyer at the firm told Reuters.Vijay Aggarwal, a lawyer for Modi, declined to comment.($1 = 68.8990 Indian rupees)
Cavalli's creative director Paul Surridge quits:::::FILE PHOTO: British creative director Paul Surridge acknowledges the applause at the end of Roberto Cavalli Spring/Summer 2018 show at the Milan Fashion Week in Milan, Italy, September 22, 2017.REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo ROME (Reuters) - Paul Surridge said on Monday he would resign from his position as creative director of Italian fashion house Roberto Cavalli, confirming press rumors about his imminent exit.The designer, who joined the Florentine label in 2017, said in an Instagram post he wished to focus on other projects that I put aside in order to achieve our common goals with Roberto Cavalli Group.The company, founded by Roberto Cavalli in the early 1970s and famous for its animal prints, was taken over by Italian private equity firm Clessidra in 2015 in a bid to turn it around.Clessidra in October hired Rothschild to find a minority partner for the fashion group, sources have said.Since then the private equity group, which owns 90 percent of Cavalli, has also decided to consider offers for a majority stake in the fashion label, other sources have said, as the sale process has proven more difficult than previously envisaged.Under new Chief Executive Gian Giacomo Ferraris, hired in 2016 to help boost the label, the company has been working to expand into lifestyle categories to find new sources of revenue.Ferraris said in October Cavalli was on track to return to a net profit in 2019.
Immigrant portraits in New York art show face down Trump:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - Immigrant faces captured in life-sized portraits by artist Betsy Ashton look the viewer straight in the eye, as if eager to tell their stories of leaving home to brave new struggles in a strange land.Visitors examine Artist Betsy Ashton's exhibition, "Portraits of Immigrants: Unknown Faces, Untold Stories" at Riverside Church in New York, U.S., March 10, 2019.REUTERS/Demetrius Freeman Ashton said she created the oil paintings to counter what she calls a false political narrative spun by the Trump administration.I simply decided it was time to balance the story, time to try to counter this inflammatory rage thats being whipped up against a group of people that dont deserve it, Ashton said.Her Portraits of Immigrants are on display through Easter at Manhattans Riverside Church, about 10 miles up the Hudson River from Ellis Island, where 12 million newcomers landed from 1892 to 1954.The Statue of Liberty towers over the island, asking the world in a plaque to Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.The portraits include teachers, entrepreneurs, a nurse, housekeeper, actor, politician and barista from Asia, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Europe.They are newcomers and long-timers.Some are U.S. citizens, others have proper documents, one does not.STRUGGLING TO FIT IN TO A NEW CULTURE Their stories, which Ashton, a former CBS News correspondent, wrote and posted next to each portrait, tell of struggling to fit in to a new culture and learning a new language for the promise of a better life.The collective portrayal of the immigrant experience is whats compelling, not just one individual story, said Ron Kim, who came to New York from South Korea when he was 6.He is pictured in his New York State Assembly office, where he represents part of Queens, one of the citys five boroughs.Another immigrant immortalized in oil paint is Abdul Saboor, who taught U.S. troops the culture of his native Afghanistan before coming to the United States nearly five years ago.For Saboor, now a U.S. citizen working for the upstate New York nonprofit that helped resettle him, Ashtons exhibit is an opportunity for Americans to imagine themselves in my skin.Both Kim and Saboor said they are keenly aware of - and disturbed by - the political hot potato that immigration has become since Donald Trump became president.As a candidate in 2016, Trump stirred anti-immigrant fervor by accusing Mexico of sending drug dealers, gangs and rapists into the country, as his supporters loudly urged him to build that wall along the southern U.S. border.As president, Trump has not only maintained a rhetorical drum beat against illegal immigrants, but also sought to narrow the pathways for legal immigration and travel.The White House did not respond to a request for comment on this story.SERMON ABOUT THE GOOD SAMARITAN Ashton says hearing Trump during the campaign shortly after a Sunday sermon about the Good Samaritan inspired her to put brush to canvas to show the true stories of American newcomers.In her neighborhood in Queens, where nearly half the population is foreign born, the English-Scottish-Welsh-German artist whose ancestors on her fathers side arrived in the country about 300 years ago, had no trouble finding immigrants.She started with Eddie Rigo, who runs the espresso bar she visits each morning.He fled crime-ridden Sao Paulo where his Italian family had been in the pizza business.Then came Beata Szakowicz Kombel, a nurse Ashton knows from doctor visits.She left Polands sagging economy in the early 1990s.The collection grew to 16, and Ashton is seeking two more immigrants from troubled countries, preferably Venezuela and Syria, to complete the set.Winning over her subjects often took salesmanship.I didnt want to be in the spotlight, said Porez Luxama, who left Haiti in the 1990s and teaches math in a New York City middle school.But she was very convincing.Ashton, whose works include a portrait on display in the U.S. embassy in London, has spent two years on the project, which cost her more than $200,000 in lost income.She is seeking other venues for her exhibit after it leaves Riverside Church.The subjects include Angel (not her real name), who came over on a tourist visa 20 years ago; Maria Solome, a Guatemalan housekeeper who sneaked across the Rio Grande but recently secured a green card; and John Lam who came from Hong Kong poor and now heads the Lam Group real estate investment conglomerate.Slideshow (9 Images) Despite their assorted origins, races and religions, Ashton said immigrants share a determination to overcome the problems that drove them from their homes.Its the grit, the guts and the resilience that comes with survival, sacrifice and risk-taking, she said.Those are the same qualities that we celebrate in immigrants from generations past.(This story refiles to fix amount in paragraph 22 to $200,000)
Alibaba, Tencent, car makers set up $1.5 billion China ride-hailing venture:::::BEIJING (Reuters) - Alibaba, Tencent, Suning, and car makers including Chongqing Changan Automobile have set up a $1.5 billion Chinese ride-hailing venture, a move that could test the dominance of ride-sharing giant Didi Chuxing.FILE PHOTO: A man stands near the logo of Alibaba Group at the company's newly-launched office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia June 18, 2018.REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin/File Photo Chongqing Changan Automobile said on Friday that it has invested 1.6 billion yuan ($238.36 million) in the Nanjing-based investment company alongside partners such as the investment units of Alibaba, Tencent and retailer Suning.Com Co Ltd, and automakers FAW and Dongfeng Motor.China is home to the worlds largest ride-hailing market, estimated by consulting firm Bain & Co to be worth $23 billion.Of that, Didi Chuxing takes 90 percent of all bookings.However, a swathe of car makers, from BMW, Geely to SAIC as well as other tech firms such as Meituan Dianping have also launched their own mobility services in a bid to grab a share of the fast growing market.Didi, which is backed by Japans SoftBank Group Corp and Uber Technologies, also has joint ventures with BAIC and Volkswagen.Wijaya Ng, who tracks Chinas automotive industry at Ipsos Business Consulting, said the new venture dovetails with a larger, global trend wherein traditional automakers are entering the ride-hailing sector.They see that moving forward, if car-hailing is going to be the future, they want to tap into this market sooner rather than later, said Ng.Changan said that itself, Dongfeng and FAW will each have a 15 percent stake in the joint venture, which will set up a ride-sharing company with a focus on new energy vehicles.Suning will be the biggest shareholder with a 19 percent stake while Alibaba and Tencents investment units will together hold the remainder shares with some other funds, it added.The new ride-hailing company and its investors, which come from a range of fields, will help form business synergies which will help enrich the companies ecosystems, Suning said in a statement.FAW and Dongfeng confirmed the venture while Alibaba and Tencent declined to comment beyond the Changan statement.Didi declined to comment.Shares of Changan and Dongfeng Automobile Co Ltd jumped by the maximum daily allowed 10 percent after the news.FAW Car Co Ltd shares climbed 6.6 percent.The growing popularity of ride-hailing services for commuting and running errands in congested cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is showing early signs of reducing private car ownership.However, the industry and Didi came under tighter government scrutiny and regulation last year after a Didi passenger was raped and murdered by her driver.

Writers Guild of America sues four major Hollywood talent agencies:::::NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Wire creator David Simon, seven other writers, and the Writers Guild of America sued the four major Hollywood talent agencies on Wednesday for getting paid in such a way that the agencies financial interests prevail over those of their clients.FILE PHOTO: The iconic Hollywood sign is shown on a hillside above a neighborhood in Los Angeles California, U.S., February 1, 2019.REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo The plaintiffs are trying to establish that talent agency packaging fees, in which an agent is paid directly by the writers employer instead of getting paid a 10 percent commission fee from the writer, are illegal under both California and federal law.In recent decades, packaging fees have become the standard form of compensation for the four largest talent agencies, which have grown in power and reach amid a wave of consolidation.The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleges that because packaging fees are generally tied to a shows revenue and profits, the agencies are incentivized to reduce the amount production companies pay writers and other talent on a show.As such, packaging fees violate California fiduciary law, the suit claims, because they pit the interests of the agency against those of its writer client.The fees also violate the states Unfair Competition Law, the suit maintains, because they amount to an illegal kickback from production companies to agencies.The four agencies named in the complaint - William Morris Endeavor, Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency and ICM Partners - receive over 80 percent of the packaging fees paid by Hollywood studios and networks, according to the WGA.The Association of Talent Agencies (ATA), whose members include the four defendants in Wednesdays lawsuit, said the filing was a sign that the WGA is on a predetermined path to chaos that never included any intention to negotiate.Knowing that it could take months or even years for this litigation to be resolved, WGA leaders are unnecessarily forcing their members and our industry into long-term uncertainty, ATA executive director Karen Stuart said in a statement.The relationship between the WGA and the Association of Talent Agencies, has been governed by a 43-year-old agreement that regulates how agents represent writers.After negotiations over a new, updated agreement fell apart, the WGA asked agents to sign a new code of contact that would eliminate packaging fees.The majority of agents refused, and on Friday the WGA told its members to fire agents that had not signed the new code.

Actress Lori Loughlin pleads not guilty in college admissions case:::::BOSTON (Reuters) - Actress Lori Loughlin on Monday entered a not guilty plea to charges that she participated in a wide-ranging college admissions scam by paying bribes to get her two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California.Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom Full House, and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.California college admissions consultant William Rick Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.Prosecutors allege that Loughlin, 54, and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USCs crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them.A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal.Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including Desperate Housewives TV star Felicity Huffman.She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.

Art frenzy takes over Havana as biennial kicks off:::::HAVANA (Reuters) - Cones of white paper sprout from the seasalt-eroded pillars of one colonial building along Havanas seafront, elaborately painted curtains cascade from another while out front children play with an installation of multicolored hoses.A giant photograph of a boy by French photographer and artist JR is seen on a wall, during the 13th Havana Biennial, in Havana, Cuba April 12, 2019.REUTERS/Fernando Medina Havanas 13th Biennial kicked off this weekend with works by more than 300 contemporary artists from 52 countries taking over the citys museums, galleries and open-air spaces, and many more collateral exhibits.They turned my home into an artwork, said Silvia Perez, smiling at the paper sprouting from the colonnade of her home, a piece by Cuban artist Elio Jess Fonseca.The artist said it meant peace.The transformation of the Malecon seafront boulevard into an open-air, interactive gallery, has become one of the most popular venues of Cubas most important arts event.Along the sidewalk this year are smooth boulders encased in volcanic slabs by Mexican artist Jose Davila, while a swirling light installation by Peruvian artist Grimanesa Amoros protudes from a building.Cubas Communist government, which has heavily promoted the arts since the countrys 1959 leftist revolution, created the Havana Biennial in 1984 to promote artists from the developing world, especially Cuban ones.This year, 80 Cubans will exhibit their work, including a performance on Monday by Manuel Mendive, considered the Caribbean islands top living artist.Still, it also includes a large contingent of European and U.S. artists including Cuban-Americans like Enrique Martnez Celaya and Emilio Perez.Biennial Director Jorge Alfonso said it had been a challenge to stage the biennial given Cubas difficult economic situation - authorities postponed it half a year - but that it had succeeded underscored the importance Cuba placed on culture.Not even in the most difficult moments have we ever given up on staging one of these kind of events, he told Reuters.The slogan of this years edition, the construction of the possible, is related to our ideal that a better world is possible.Some artists who are critical of the government however have subverted that slogan.In one piece on the Malecon called Potemkin Village, Cuban-born artist Juan Andres Milanes Benito who lives in Norway has propped what appears to be the perfect facade of a building on another that is falling into disrepair.It fits a lot with the Cuban government these days and how the system is working - there is a lot of facade, he said.Inside it is not so perfect.Originally he had wanted to replicate the facade of a renovated government building but authorities would not allow him, he said.Some Cuban artists feel the Havana Biennial itself is a facade papering over simmering tensions between them and authorities.Artist Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, who led a campaign against a controversial new decree on the cultural sector last year, was arrested last Friday after staging a small yet politically charged performance in his neighborhood.Slideshow (5 Images) His whereabouts remain unknown, his friends say.Asked by Reuters about the arrest in a news conference, the head of Cubas National Council of Visual Arts, Norma Rodriguez, said as far as I know he is an activist not an artist.Cuba considers dissidents to be mercenaries in the pay of the United States trying to subvert the government.The Havana Biennial runs until May 12.

AI predicts who survives 'Game of Thrones':::::MUNICH (Reuters) - If you are a Game of Thrones fan and appreciate the element of surprise, stop reading now.Students at the Technical University of Munich have developed an application to predict which character has the best chance to claim the coveted Iron Throne in the HBO hit medieval fantasy series about warring families.They have taught the application to scour the web for information about each of the characters, which is then processed by artificial intelligence algorithms to assess their survival chances.We scraped the results from different Wiki pages and Wiki-like pages about the books and TV show and we took out data like gender and age of the characters, said student Christian Dallago.We put all this together to train the algorithm to tell us when this character is going to die.There is a good chance the application will get it right.Back in 2016, an algorithm created by computer science students at the same university in the southern German city shortly before the start of Season 6 accurately predicted that Jon Snow would resurrect.If youre still reading, clearly youre not a fan of plot twists and turns.So here you go: AI says that Daenerys Targaryen has the best chance of survival in the final season, which starts on Sunday.(This story has been refiled to correct title in headline, paragraph 1 to Game, not Games)
Disney unveils price, launch date for big streaming push:::::BURBANK, Calif. (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co priced its highly anticipated streaming video service below Netflix in an aggressive move to challenge the dominant streaming service and entice families to buy yet another monthly subscription.Disney said on Thursday its new family-friendly streaming service will cost $7 monthly or $70 annually with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies from some of the worlds most popular entertainment franchises in a bid to challenge the digital dominance of Netflix.The ad-free monthly subscription called Disney+ is set to launch on Nov. 12 and in every major global market over time, the company said.In addition to Disney films and TV shows, it will feature programming from the Marvel superhero universe, the Star Wars galaxy, Toy Story creator Pixar animation the National Geographic channel and the entire library of The Simpsons.What we are putting forward is an aggressive strategy, Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger told analysts at the presentation.Weve got to be very serious and all in on it.The company set a target of luring between 60 million to 90 million subscribers and achieving profitability in fiscal year 2024.It plans to plow a little over $1 billion in cash to finance original programming in fiscal 2020 and about $2 billion by 2024.The cost of the service was lower than the $7.50 per month that Wall Street analysts expected on average, according to a Reuters poll, and could likely be seen as a stronger bid to appeal to more customers.Patrice Cucinello, a director at Fitch Ratings, said Disney had priced the new service very affordably.Disney is approaching streaming offerings, particularly Disney+, with guns blazing, looking to take share and quickly ramp subscriber growth, Cucinello said.To get it in front of more people, Disney said it has struck deals with Roku Inc and Sony Corp to distribute Disney+ on streaming devices and console gaming systems and expects it to be widely available on smart televisions, tablets, and other outlets by launch.It did not mention if it would be available on Apple Incs upcoming video service.Disney kicked off its presentation to Wall Street analysts at its Burbank, California, headquarters on Thursday with a video that demonstrated the breadth of its portfolio, showing clips from dozens of classic TV shows and movies from Frozen and The Lion King to Avatar and The Sound of Music.FILE PHOTO: Disney characters Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse attend the 25th anniversary of Disneyland Paris at the park in Marne-la-Vallee, near Paris, France, April 12, 2017.REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo The transformation of the Mouse House, as it is known, from a cable television powerhouse into a leader of streaming media could be Igers final legacy as he told Wall Street analysts he would not extend his contract beyond 2021 and was working with the board of directors on a succession plan.GLOBAL GROWTH Executives said they see opportunities to take its ESPN+ sport streaming video service to Latin America and are looking into international expansion of its Hulu streaming video business, which offers movies and shows targeted to adults.Disney also forecast Hulus subscribers to reach 40 million to 60 million by fiscal 2024 and reach profitability in the United States by either 2023 or 2024.Hulu currently has 25 million subscribers and is expected to lose $1.5 billion in the current fiscal year.The digital push is Disneys response to cord-cutting, the dropping of cable service that has hit its ESPN sports network and other channels, and the rise of Netflix Inc.The Silicon Valley upstart has amassed 139 million customers worldwide since it began streaming 12 years ago.Disney will join the market at a time when audiences are facing a host of choices, and monthly bills, for digital entertainment.Apple, AT&T Incs WarnerMedia and others plan new streaming services.Slideshow (3 Images) To bolster its potential digital portfolio, Disney recently purchased film and TV assets from Rupert Murdochs 21st Century Fox and gained prized properties such as Avatar.Disney had been supplying new movies such as Black Panther and Beauty and the Beast to Netflix after their runs in theaters but ended that arrangement this year to feed its own streaming ambitions.The company estimated it is foregoing $150 million in licensing revenue this fiscal year by saving programming for its own platforms.The Disney+ programming will draw in part from Disneys deep library of classic family films.It also will include exclusive original content such as a live-action Star Wars series called The Mandalorian, a show focused on Marvel movie villain Loki, and animated Monsters at Work, inspired by hit Pixar movie Monsters Inc.Some new Disney movies, such as a Lady and the Tramp remake, will go directly to the Disney+ app.Other new releases will appear on Disney+ after their run in theaters and after they cycle out of the home video sales window, executives have said.
U.S. Senator Warner eyes social media bills for hate speech, data portability:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.Senator Mark Warner, who co-sponsored legislation this week to ban deceptive practices by social media companies, said on Thursday he was eyeing additional bills aimed at limiting hate speech and allowing users to move their data across platforms.The Democratic lawmaker said he would offer more bills in the next month or two, ideally with Republican colleagues as a co-sponsor.The additional legislation could focus on hate speech, data portability, which gives social media users the ability to easily take their data to another site, and transparency about who or what is on the other side of an internet conversation, Warner said in an interview with Reuters.On Tuesday, Warner joined with Republican Senator Deb Fischer to introduce a bill to bar online platforms like Facebook Inc or Alphabet Incs Google from misleading people into giving personal data to companies, or otherwise tricking them.It would also ban online platforms with more than 100 million monthly active users from designing addicting games or other websites for children under age 13.Warner is eager to increase transparency on social media platforms.Shouldnt we have the right to know whether were being contacted by a human being versus a bot when youre on social media?he said.Issues of engagement and data collection are key for social media companies since they use information gathered about users to sell advertisements, a key source of profit.Warner noted the real-life implications of hate speech on social media, pointing to mass killings in New Zealand and Pittsburgh.FILE PHOTO: Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) talks with military families about their hazardous living conditions during a meeting at the Peninsula Workforce Development Office in Newport News, Virginia, U.S. March 11, 2019.REUTERS/Ryan M. Kelly In a massacre in New Zealand, a gunman opened fire in two mosques on March 15, killing 50 people as he broadcast the attack live on Facebook.Last year, 11 people were shot to death in a Pittsburgh synagogue.The man accused in the killings had made aggressive anti-Semitic comments in online forums.Some of the proposed legislation could be rolled into a federal privacy bill being drafted in Congress.That bill was prompted by Californias data privacy law that imposes fines of up to $7,500 on large companies for intentional failure to disclose data collection or delete user data on request, or for selling others data without permission.It takes effect next year.I want technology to stay.I want the social media platforms to stay, Warner said.But I do think the days of the Wild Wild West where anything goes, people just arent going to allow it.

'Avengers: Endgame' and 'Game of Thrones' highlight peak-geek culture:::::(CNN) If you need further proof that the nerds have inherited the earth, look no further than this coming weekend, when "Game of Thrones" and "Avengers: Endgame" will wage separate battles for pop-culture supremacy.As it happens, the hugely anticipated war for the future of Westeros in the HBO drama will coincide with the release of the latest Marvel sequel, which will feature its own separate melee to save the universe from the clutches of Thanos.Beyond a "peak geek" moment, the twin arrival of these events -- an overused term in entertainment circles that actually applies in these cases -- says something about both the "show" and "business" side of the media landscape.Culturally speaking, both the movie and TV show reinforce the importance that science fiction/fantasy/comics have come to occupy in terms of the increasingly rare phenomenon of shared mass entertainment.At a time of a la carte TV viewing and "Netflix and chill," "Avengers" is likely to eclipse the record $257 million domestic haul of its predecessor "Infinity War," while "Thrones" surely has a good shot of surpassing the season premiere's record same-day rating of 17.4 million viewers.Read More
'Veep' imitates life with campaign collusion plot:::::(CNN) The following contains spoilers about the April 21 episode of "Veep.""Veep" has provided a broadly satiric look at politics through its six seasons, in a knowing fashion that has more than a few times caused life to imitate art.Yet as the show heads into its final flurry of episodes, the HBO series has incorporated what appear to be a few rather overt art-imitates-life flourishes.After the writers have lamented that they're hard-pressed to match the absurdity of the current news cycle, they seem to have wryly adopted the strategy that if you can't beat them, join them.In a plot that could hardly be better timed with the release of the redacted Mueller report, Sunday's campaign-themed fourth episode featured past and possibly future president Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus, brilliant as always) engaging in back-channel negotiations with the Chinese government, who approach her campaign through a dimwitted if pliant surrogate.The Chinese then proceed to assist her in a key primary, which includes employing shadowy tactics designed to suppress African-American voter turnout in South Carolina.Read More

'Game of Thrones' Episode 2 recap: Let's all sit by the fire before we die:::::Did you like that episode of the Game of Thrones ?Did all the fireside chats and sweet moments of affection between your faves warm your heart and make you foolishly believe, even for a moment, that there may be true happiness awaiting them on the other side of this war?Good, because we all know what happens next : PAIN, and LOTS OF IT.Winterfell is preparing for battle.For the common folk, this involves lots of training and fighting and weapons making and giant stick-whittling, but for the main characters, it mostly means chugging fermented goat's milk and hooking up on hay bales.Hey, everyone's pretty sure they're going to die anyway.Everyone except Daenerys, that is.What else would explain her continued preoccupation with ruling the Seven Kingdoms when there's an entire army of dead people at her door?She's not dense, and she's seen the threat of the Army of the Dead firsthand, so there's no other explanation than to assume she's just very, very confident that the Night King is gonna be an easy win.Even when Jon (finally!)confesses the truth -- that he is her brother's son and a legitimate Targaryen -- her first thought isn't "Wow, I'm having relations with my nephew," it's that Jon is now her royal competition.Sure, the bar for incest on this show is pretty low, but it still bears consideration, ya know?Previous Recaps Season 8, Episode 1: You now know something, Jon Snow After a tense little parley, Jamie is begrudgingly welcomed at Winterfell, which gives him plenty of time to catch up with Brienne, Tyrion and The Artist Formerly Known as Bran.Bran politely refrains from telling everyone that Jaime definitely tried to kill him all those years ago.He explains that Jamie is now useful in the war to come and that, no offense, it's pretty bold of the newly redeemed knight to assume he's going to survive.For all his power, Bran's social skills definitely scream "Guy Who Was Educated Inside a Tree."Speaking of tension, Daenerys is still at odds with Sansa, who is still just trying to figure out how to feed everyone and get a general idea of what the North is going to look like once everything is said and done.Sensible -- or should we say, SANSABLE.It's telling that Dany has a pretty good vision of what her Iron Throne rule will look like but hasn't given a lot of thought to the future of her nephew boo's homeland.And just like that, their burgeoning sisterhood is quickly stalled.Dany is also at odds with Tyrion, who either did realize Cersei would never send her army north, and lied about it to protect her, or didn't realize she wouldn't send her army, and is just not very smart anymore.Even though Good Guy Jorah tries to defend Tyrion and his sometimes-smartness, the rift between Dany and Tyrion is stil pretty palpable.It's kind of ironic, since Tyrion is basically the only other character this week, in the tense minutes before war, to show any glimmer of hope for survival.After all, you can't die at 80 with a belly full of wine and a [redacted's] [redacted] around your [redacted] if a White Walker gets you first.That's how the episode ends, with Tyrion staring out between the Winterfell merlons and on the other side of the black night, the frozen members of an elderly KISS cover band staring back.Burning questions If Bran knows everything that has happened and is going to happen, and is the only person who can succinctly explain what the Night King wants, why does he spend most of his time waiting around in courtyards and staring at trees?We need INTEL, Bran, not gothic monologues about the persistence of memory!Is Ghost going to do something soon or just waste the CGI budget standing there to remind people he still exists?Are any of the main characters going to actually sit out the fight?It would be a bold move, but Gendry DID look pretty asleep and Davos IS getting pretty old... Where are the Dothraki?Are they okay?This weather can't be good for them.Did Davos at least get them some soup?Melisandre, what's up?We have a few burning questions for you specifically.No, not questions about burning.But you would be a lot of help right now.Best line Tyrion to Jaime: "She never fooled you.You always knew exactly who she was and you loved her anyway."Tyrion may be rusty in the common sense department, but he always has his loyal brother and treacherous sister's relationship pinned perfectly.Oh sweet Jaime, the things you've done for love.Worst line Sam to Jorah: "I hope we win."Best scene Jaime: "Brienne, I will knight you, giving you the dream you have always kept in your heart but never felt you could speak aloud.Let your tears fall during this truly pure and deeply emotional moment as I show you, in words and deeds, that you are worthy of honor and respect and that I would gladly die by your side as an equal and a friend."Tormund: "I WAS BREASTFED BY A GIANTESS."Ship watch Tormund and Brienne and Jaime Yeah, we know you love the big lady, Tormund.EVERYONE knows you love the big lady.But if you want to win the big lady you gotta give the big lady what she wants: Knighthood and some personal space!Missandei and Grey Worm Two of the most sensible characters on the show discuss one of the most sensible plans of action: Getting the hell out of this frozen death hole as soon as possible and going to the beach.Here's hoping against hope that they'll get to chase butterflies together on Naath :( Arya and Gendry HOO BOY this ship turned into a speedboat and we were NOT ready.Arya's last look as she lay naked next to her forge buddy was an interesting one, though.Could there something else at play here?Death count No one...Really?No one?[checks notes] This can't be good.Stray observations Okay, Cersei still IS pregnant, to the best of her brothers' terrible knowledge.Sam joining Bran in his musings about the fragility of human memory wasn't just him having the sads about his dead family.It also supports a popular fan theory that Sam will survive this mess and be the one to put the whole story to parchment at the Citadel.Also, Sam giving Ser Jorah his dead dad's Valyrian steel sword is a nice touch.As soon as Sam stole it from his father you knew it would become important.Well, we hope it becomes important.Podrick has a nice voice and long hair now?Who allowed this to happen?Theon fans, you got your moment.His redemption arc is complete, and he has Sansa's full approval.Related: Getting Sansa's approval has somehow become a true test of merit on this show, and you can't argue with the results.Speaking of Sansa, she's wearing that Littlefinger necklace again.In fact, her whole getup was very ... Littlefingery.We're not saying she'll pick up the mantle of chaotic schemer.She's always learned from the ones who betrayed her, so nodding to their dearly departed influences through fashion is just probably part of her "I know BS when I see it" personality.One bold prediction The crypt is going to be wight city "The women and children are going to the crypt!They are going to be safe there!"Narrator: "They are definitely not going to be safe there."

Marvel lifts its TV game to higher power for Disney+:::::(CNN) Marvel is about to unleash what could be its biggest movie ever with "Avengers: Endgame," which, given the studio's track record, is no small feat.But after some hits and misfires, the upcoming launch of Disney+ suggests the company is about to lift its TV game to a higher power as well.At Disney's recent presentation for the streaming service, Marvel confirmed a number of planned live-action series, each featuring characters -- and actors -- popularized in its theatrical blockbusters.The roster includes "WandaVision," with Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen as the Vision and Scarlet Witch; "The Falcon and the Winter Soldier," with Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan; and a show about Thor villain Loki, starring Tom Hiddleston.There are also reports of a planned "Hawkeye" limited series, starring Jeremy Renner."We're extremely enthusiastic about the opportunities that Disney+ supplies," Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige stated at the investor event."These are new long-form stories in ways we've never done before."Disney has clearly sought to put its best feet forward on behalf of the streaming venture, including the first live-action "Star Wars" series, "The Mandalorian."But Marvel appears to have adopted a new strategy in this space -- one that casts a not-very-flattering light on its previous output -- after having largely devoted its TV efforts to second-tier characters more peripherally connected to its vaunted "cinematic universe."Read More
Jussie Smollett's brother defends him in new essay:::::(CNN) Jussie Smollett's older brother, Jojo Smollett, is supporting him in a new essay published by BET over the weekend."It has not yet been 90 days since my younger brother, Jussie Smollett, was assaulted on a cold winter night in Chicago," the older Smollett wrote."Within less than three months, his life has been turned upside down as my family and I have witnessed him endure unrelenting attacks to his character and reputation."Jussie Smollett, who is black and identifies as gay, told police that two men attacked him on January 29 and yelled racist and homophobic slurs while striking him, police said.The incident ended with a noose being placed around Smollett's neck, according to police.He was later investigated for allegedly staging the incident and was indicted on 16 felony disorderly conduct charges.Read More

Kiss guitarist Paul Stanley reveals a birth defect drew him to fame:::::(CNN) Kiss guitarist Paul Stanley says he was drawn to fame because of a birth defect.During a conversation with Dan Rather on The Big Interview , set to air April 23, Stanley said he pursued fame to compensate for his insecurities."I had what's called a microtia, which is basically not having an ear," he told Rather."I wasn't very socially adept, and when you have something physical that sets you apart from people, it makes you the target of unrelenting scrutiny and sometimes ridicule."Researchers have a hard time estimating how many babies in the US are affected since there are varying severities of the condition, according to the CDC , but recent birth defects tracking systems have estimated that microtia occurs in less than 1 in 10,000 live births to about 5 in 10,000 live births.The musician said his success with Kiss and subsequent rise to fame was "a way to push it in people's faces and say, 'You see, you should have been nice to me!'"Ultimately, he found that being famous didn't solve all of his problems or change anything."At that point in your life when you become famous it's either a disappointment because it's not a remedy, and you either put a needle in your arm, a gun in your mouth or you live life as a victim, and I'm not cut out for that," he said.This realization led him to turn to "self-exploration" and working becoming a better person."I was blessed to be a part of an idea to become the band we never saw, and that led me on a course that I'm still on today.Where it's taking me, God only knows," he told Rather.

Beyoncé's 'Homecoming' doc on Netflix is black excellence:::::(CNN) In April 2018, Beyonc Giselle Knowles-Carter stood in her full goddess glory and drawled, "Coachella, you ready?"The music festival wasn't ready, nor was the world, for what the pop star turned out: two nights of performances that were as much about history as they were history in the making.Thanks to Netflix, we now have some insight into the performance that launched a thousand think pieces."Homecoming: A Film by Beyonc," premiered early Wednesday and it was the fulfillment of all the ancestors' hopes and dreams.Beyonc also dropped "Homecoming: The Live Album."Written, directed and produced by the singer, and shot over eight months, the Netflix project is part concert film, part documentary with a behind-the-scenes look at the two weekend performances which made her the first black woman to ever headline the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.And it was one for the ages."Beychella" took up the entire stage, complete with an orchestra culled from historically black college and university (HBCU) band members, dancers, themes related to African-American culture and her stirring rendition of the black national anthem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing."There were also guest appearances by her fellow Destiny's Child members, her sister Solange and her husband, rapper Jay-Z.For nearly two hours, Beyonc reminded us why her fan base, known as the Beyhive, loses it when she so much as posts a photo on Instagram.But while the uninitiated may have thought they were just enjoying a hell of a Beyonc concert, "Homecoming" lets it be known how intentionally and lovingly black it all was.Filled with quotes from famed black intellectuals, as well as snippets of an audio diary in which the superstar shares how and why her Coachella performance came to be, "Homecoming" is a love letter to HBCUs (the title alone is a nod to the importance of homecomings on black campuses with its band and drumline performances, as well as sorority and fraternity events).For that reason, special advance screenings were held for students at some of the venerable HBCUs, including Spelman and Morehouse in Atlanta and Howard University in Washington DC.There was plenty of "swag surfing" (a popular dance done at concerts) by attendees and singing along with the hits.There was also a plethora of emotion and gratitude that such a superstar would use her celebrity to share the beauty, pain and joy that is the black experience.Far from shying away, Beyonc has embraced her blackness and issues of race.Her 2016 visual album "Lemonade" was critically acclaimed and lauded for its themes of black feminism, love, betrayal, empowerment, tribalism and family.Weeks before that album's release, her costume references to the Black Panthers during her Superbowl halftime performance outraged police unions and led to calls to boycott her performances (something that didn't come to fruition).It hasn't stopped either the singer or her husband from continuing to use their influence to shed light on the state of people of color.He is the executive producer of "Rest in Power: The Trayvon Martin Story," a six-episode unscripted series devoted to the 2012 killing and subsequent trial of George Zimmerman for the shooting death of the teen.In January, the rapper was part of a group of sports and business leaders who launched an organization to try and reform the criminal justice system.Jay-Z appears in "Homecoming" at points seemingly in awe of his wife as task master.A perfectionist, she controlled every aspect of the Coachella performance, right down to the beading on the costumes.It was a struggle, not only because of the multitudes involved in making the performance happen, but also because it occurred months after she had given birth to her twins, Rumi and Sir (daughter Blue Ivy is 7).In "Homecoming," Beyonc shares her desire to be with her growing family, even as she worked diligently to give her audience the show that had been delayed a year because of her pregnancy.She presents a performance that was so unapologetically black that even her mother, Tina Knowles Lawson, said in an Instagram post at the time that she "was afraid that the predominately white audience at Coachella would be confused by all of the black culture and Black college culture because it was something that they might not get.""Her brave response to me made me feel a-bit selfish and ashamed," Lawson wrote."She said i have worked very hard to get to the point where i have a true voice and At this point in my life and my career i have a responsibility to do whats best for the world and not what is most popular.""Homecoming" is a testament to that hard work.
'Sesame Street' shows us how 'Game of Thrones' probably won't end:::::(CNN) Elmo wants to bring peace to Westeros.In a video released Thursday, which emphasizes respect, the "Sesame Street" fave tries to encourage levelheaded dialogue between Cersei and Tyrion Lannister, who are in a tense conversation when Elmo arrives."I only want what's best for Westeros," Tyrion says."And I only want for you not to get what you want," Cersei bites back."See, this is why you don't have any friends," her brother retorts.Read More
Jimmy Kimmel's 'All in the Family' and 'Jeffersons' special will air in May:::::(CNN) Jimmy Kimmel's long-awaited live sitcom special, recreating "All in the Family" and "The Jeffersons," now has an air date and all-star cast."Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's All in the Family and The Jeffersons" will air May 22 on ABC, the network announced A pair of Oscar winners will take on the iconic roles.Woody Harrelson and Marisa Tomei will star as Archie and Edith Bunker, while Jamie Foxx and Wanda Sykes will portray George and Louise Jefferson.Ellie Kemper takes on the role of Gloria Stivic, with Will Ferrell as Tom Willis and Justina Machado as Florence Johnston.Kimmel is set to co-host the event with legendary television producer Norman Lear, who created the shows back in the 1970s.Read More
'Ramy' puts fresh spin on Muslim experience:::::(CNN) The quest for identity as a Muslim living in New Jersey only scratches the surface of "Ramy," a Hulu series that deftly combines comedy with drama, and which gradually peels back layers in ways as impressive as they are relatable.Far from a "Muslims are just like us" sitcom, comic Ramy Youssef's deeply personal show explores familiar themes in a fresh and at times poignant manner.At first blush, "Ramy" resembles the latest addition to a hard-to-categorize brand of half-hour premium series like Aziz Ansari's "Master of None" or Donald Glover's "Atlanta," which explore the vagaries of young adulthood through a unique prism.There are also elements of "The Big Sick," the 2017 movie starring Kumail Nanjiani, in the issues that surround growing up Muslim in the US, caught between the prevailing culture and immigrant parents rooted in tradition.Unlike that movie, however, Ramy -- a first-generation Egyptian-American -- is religious, if occasionally torn by the temptations and pressures associated with life in the US."I'm not going to flirt with girls at the mosque," he tells his parents, who are desperate to see him marry a nice Muslim girl.Later, a woman he's dating expresses surprise when he suggests, almost sheepishly, that he adheres to his faith."You're Muslim I thought in the way I'm Jewish," she says.Read More
'Fosse/Verdon' choreographs FX's latest look at old Hollywood:::::(CNN) If concept and casting are half the battle, "Fosse/Verdon" earns a curtain call before the overture.Sam Rockwell and Michelle Williams play director Bob Fosse and star Gwen Verdon, whose tumultuous relationship and partnership provides another delicious window into what amounts to an FX niche chronicling the big personalities of old Hollywood.The allure of the subject matter is surely helpful, since this handsomely produced eight-part series -- which counts Lin-Manuel Miranda and daughter Nicole Fosse among its many producers -- gets off to a slow start, choreographing the story out of sequence, in a manner that's initially as disorienting as some of those scenes in "All That Jazz."Stick with it, though, and this limited series provides not only a fascinating snapshot of its time but of the unique qualities of the central duo's relationship, with Fosse wooing Verdon, cheating on her and divorcing her, but never losing his reliance upon her as a creative muse and confidant.The depth of that interaction proves vital, since Fosse alone represents a virtual clich in terms of a tortured artist -- someone who can't sit through the premiere of "Cabaret," his breakthrough film, muttering, "All I see is the s**t I should have fixed."Through quick-cut flashbacks, there are glimpses of Fosse as a performer, someone who dreamed of becoming Fred Astaire.He instead became a choreographer and director, meeting Verdon while devising her routines for "Damn Yankees," after she won her first Tony Award.Read More
'Avengers: Endgame' may mean the end for some Marvel characters:::::(CNN) For Marvel Studios, all roads have led to "Avengers: Endgame."More than a decade and 21 films in the making, the fourth Avengers film finally arrives in theaters this month with almost impossibly high expectations -- both for audiences and the box office.In the build up we've accumulated dozens of characters in the ever-sprawling Marvel Cinematic Universe.However, after the events of "Avengers: Infinity War" -- which saw the Mad Titan Thanos wipe out half of all sentient life with the snap of his fingers -- their numbers are heavily depleted.For the sake of the franchise it won't stay that way, but "Endgame" has to live up to its high-stakes billing.This writer isn't out for blood, but deaths are all but guaranteed.So who lives, who dies and who's coming back from the snap?Buckle up, because there's a lot to cover -- from what's happening both on and off screen.Here's a non-exhaustive (but still exhausting) run down of our heroes' chances.Note: This list includes spoilers up to and including "Captain Marvel.""Avengers: Endgame" had not been screened to the press at the time of writing and the blinkers are firmly on regarding set leaks and other online hearsay.Ant-Man Current status: Alive Is Scott Lang going to be the secret sauce in the fight against Thanos?We've never really taken Ant-Man seriously (lord knows he doesn't do so himself), but "Ant-Man and the Wasp's" exploration of the Quantum Realm and its time-bending properties might be the way to travel back pre-snap without the Time Stone.Added incentive for Lang to pull his finger out: the snap wiped out the Wasp, mentor Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne (the original Ant-Man and Wasp).Dead or alive?Paul Rudd's character is a relatively new entry into the MCU.Not a dead cert, but he'll likely survive.Black Panther Current status: Dead Do you really think Marvel is about to drop the superhero behind an Oscar-winning, $1.3 billion-grossing film after one solo outing?Kevin Feige announced "Black Panther 2" was happening back in March 2018 Dead or alive?Wakanda forever!Black Widow Current status: Alive Black Widow was the Avenger that never got the standalone film they deserved (sorry Hawkeye).That finally changed in 2018 when it was announced that Natasha Romanoff would receive a solo outing, with subsequent reporting that Florence Pugh has joined the cast alongside Johansson.Whether it will be an origin story or post-"Endgame" is still unconfirmed.Dead or alive?Killing off your lead before their first solo film would be an odd move, but if the "Black Widow" movie is a prequel that would leave Johansson open to explore other projects afterward and have the last say in what has been a decade-long injustice.I'm leaning toward death.Bruce Banner/The Hulk Current status: Alive When we left Banner in Wakanda he was having a real Hulk impotence problem -- kind of inconvenient for everyone.Banner/Hulk has been invaluable to the Avengers, but as a character he's often worked as a foil within the group.With no solo outing under Marvel Studios announced, and the likelihood a number of his comrades will die in "Endgame," you might think this is the end of the road for Banner.But Mark Ruffalo still has films outstanding on a six-movie deal he signed back in 2012.Dead or alive?Going to survive -- and hopefully continue the intergalactic buddy road trip with Thor.Bucky Barnes Current status: Dead Expect Barnes' death in "Infinity War" to be a motivator behind a self-sacrificing play from old friend Captain America in "Endgame" (whatever shape that might take).Barnes could well pick up the vibranium shield and become the new Cap' post-"Endgame," following a plot line from the comics.(Huge hint: Sebastian Stan is reportedly locked in to a nine-film contract .)There's also the mooted Disney+ series with Falcon.Stan has also expressed an interest in the "Black Widow" film.He'll be busy if that all comes to pass.Dead or alive?Alive -- and possibly with a few personality tweaks if he's to take up the shield.Captain America Current status: Alive Steve Rogers came back from the wilderness in "Infinity War," bearded and bad-ass.Now Captain America looks ready to lay down everything in "Endgame."Chris Evans has dropped anvil-sized hints in interviews for over a year and seems to have already said goodbye to the character on Twitter .It feels like a done deal.Dead or alive?The all-American hero is a goner.We'll miss you Cap'.Captain Marvel Current status: Alive "Captain Marvel" just cruised past the billion-dollar club at the global box office and Brie Larson's take on spacefaring pilot Carol Danvers was a critical success too."Endgame" is only the beginning, and there's murmurs she could eventually head up the Avengers.We've only just started to see what she's capable off.Dead or alive?You come at the queen, you best not miss.She lives.Doctor Strange Current status: Dead Before falling victim to the snap, Strange told Tony Stark this was the only way; he had looked into multiple futures and seen doom in every other permutation.Being the raging narcissist that he is, don't expect any self-sacrificing moves from Strange, who only made his debut in 2016.There's also the small matter of a standalone sequel reportedly in development Dead or alive?The good doctor will return.Drax the Destroyer Current status: Dead David Bautista led the "Guardians" actors in their vocal support of James Gunn after his firing.Gunn is back at the helm , and expect Drax to survive "Endgame" and feature prominently in "Guardians 3."Trivia: It's not going to happen in the Marvel Studios' PG-13 universe, but in one story from the comics Drax defeats Thanos by ripping out his heart.Dead or alive?Alive.His reflexes are too fast.Falcon Current status: Dead The Disney+ series with Bucky all but guarantees he'll be back from the dead and make it through "Endgame."Dead or alive?The second string Avenger lives.Gamora Current status: Dead Gamora's demise was a tough watch.Sacrificed by Thanos to gain the Soul Stone, if you didn't realize already, here was proof that absolute power corrupts absolutely.Killed pre-snap, but "Endgame" marketing art keeps her in the frame, suggests she can still be brought back to life.Dead or alive?If anyone deserves to survive "Endgame" it's probably Thanos' long-suffering adopted daughter.Alive.Groot Current status: Dead Big call, but no character is more beloved in the MCU.Groot already sacrificed himself once at the end of "Guardians of the Galaxy" and is only just returning to his normal size.No way they'd off him permanently.Dead or alive?Alive.There'd be riots outside Marvel HQ.Happy Hogan Current status: Alive The fate of Happy's employer Tony Stark is very much in the air (more of which later).If he does die, Stark's long-suffering friend and chauffeur would appear surplus to requirements.But he's right there in the "Spider-Man: Far From Home" trailer, which arrives in theaters in July and, according to comments from producer Amy Pascal back in 2017, starts " a few minutes after Avengers 4 wraps ."Dead or alive?Alive.Hawkeye Current status: Alive Absent in "Infinity War" because he was under house arrest (a lame excuse in my book), Hawkeye returned in the "Endgame" trailer with an outr haircut and world-weary scowl.What he's been up to is anyone's guess, but after two Avengers films in the shadow of bigger superheroes, will Hawkeye finally have his moment in the sun?Yeah, that could pretty underwhelming.Dead or alive?This smells like a redemption narrative -- I suspect Hawkeye's family might not have survived the snap.Given there's not many other places for the character to go, he could easily bite the dust.Iron Man Current status: Alive Tony Stark's first outing in 2008 was the cornerstone on which this entire cinematic universe was built.If that sounds like a eulogy, that's because it's supposed to.Robert Downey Jr. is out of contract after "Endgame" and let's face it, there's no shortage of wise-cracking egotists in the MCU ready to carry the torch.Will Stark really be able to just walk away from all of this unscathed?Dead or alive?If it happens it will be glorious, tragic and (hopefully) delivered with a wry smile.But he's a prime contender to die.Loki Current status: Dead An early victim in "Infinity War," Loki never made it past the intro, never mind the snap.Intriguingly, one of the Disney+ series in development focuses on the loveable antihero from Asgard -- with Tom Hiddleston to star, Disney have confirmed .What Disney hasn't confirmed is when it will be set.Marvel offered no comment to The Hollywood Reporter when sources suggested the series would have Loki popping up through human history like a god-level Forrest Gump.So it sounds like a prequel.Dead or alive?The master of cheating death could feasibly do it again, but the signs say he's a goner.Mantis Current status: Dead A latecomer to the Guardians clique, Mantis bit the dust in "Infinity War."But there's no good reason for her to stay dead.Fingers crossed we get plenty more laughs from this intergalactic oddball in "Guardians 3."Dead or alive?Death would be a senseless move.Mantis should live.M'Baku Current status: Alive Could M'Baku become king of Wakanda with T'Challa out of the equation?It's possible.M'Baku hasn't featured in any "Endgame" trailers, but Winston Duke has confirmed he's returning .It seems unlikely Marvel will kill off the affable vegetarian, especially given the "Us" star's ever-rising profile.Dead or alive?Alive.Nebula Current status: Alive Thanos' adopted daughter could make a big play in "Endgame."Marvel aficionados will know that in one plot from the comics , Nebula managed to seize the Infinity Gauntlet from Thanos and used it to undo his murders.She then went on a power trip and had to be stopped and imprisoned.We don't know if any of this will happen in "Endgame," but if some of it does, Nebula could end up as collateral in restoring order to the universe.That said, there's rumors a Gamora and Nebula series is in early development for Disney+, and Karen Gillan has talked about "Guardians 3" as if she's involved.Dead or alive?On the basis of her "Guardians 3" hints she'll make it.But there's a huge case for her dying in "Endgame" otherwise.Nick Fury Current status: Dead Fury set the wheels of "Endgame" in motion when he dropped Captain Marvel a message on his pager mid-disintegration.He's been through the wringer, but every time Fury has come out swinging.So don't expect the small matter of Thanos and the destruction of half the universe to spell his end.Dead or alive?Alive.He's in the "Spider-Man: Far From Home" trailer.Okoye Current status: Alive No one had Black Panther's back more than Okoye.Expect her to return with vengeance in "Endgame" to try and bring T'Challa back from the dead.No word on whether Danai Gurira is confirmed to reprise the role in "Black Panther 2," but killing Okoye in "Endgame" would come as a shock.Dead or alive?More alive than dead.Pepper Potts Current status: Alive Eagle-eyed viewers of the "Spider-Man: Far From Home" trailer will have spotted a giant check from Stark Industries signed by Pepper Potts.I'm not sure how long it takes for one of those to get printed, but remarkably Potts might outlive her maverick boss-turned-partner.Dead or alive?With Tony Stark probably heading for the exit, is the MCU going to see its first conscious uncoupling?Pass me a Goop-branded hanky.Rocket Current status: Alive A tougher call than it should be.Rocket has had quite the character arc since he was first introduced in "Guardians of the Galaxy," and a self-sacrificing move -- especially when it comes to Groot -- wouldn't be out of the question.But there's no way they'll leave Groot without his translator, right?Dead or alive?Alive and quipping.Scarlet Witch Current status: Dead Snapped after watching Vision die twice over, but reportedly returning in Disney+ series " The Vision and Scarlet Witch ".So this shouldn't be the end of the road for Wanda Maximoff.Dead or alive?Alive.Shuri Current status: Dead The internet was shocked when Marvel released marketing art suggesting Shuri was victim of the snap -- it was the first we'd heard of it.An off-camera death is short shrift for a character that stole nearly every "Black Panther" scene she was in.Don't expect her to stay out of the picture.Dead or alive?T'Challa wouldn't last two minutes without his little sister.She's going to pull through.Spider-Man Current status: Dead Tom Holland delivered a gut punch of a death scene in "Infinity War," with Peter Parker watched over by helpless mentor Iron Man.Expect Parker's resurrection to be a prime motivator for Stark.Dead or alive?Not a chance.Unless Sony and Marvel Studios have played us all and "Far From Home" is in fact a prequel, flying in the face of all previous reporting.Star-Lord Current status: Dead When the third installment of "Guardians of the Galaxy" was in the doldrums there was a question mark hanging over the fate of Peter Quill/Star-Lord, but not any more.The Guardians need their leading man.Dead or alive?He'll make the cut, you big turd blossoms.The Ancient One Current status: Dead Died in "Doctor Strange," but Tilda Swinton is reportedly among the cast of "Endgame."Expect the Ancient One to feature in some form of flashback or time travel to impart some wisdom, but not to stick around beyond "Endgame" -- she'd just get in the way of Strange in future films.Dead or alive?Dead.Thor Current status: Alive Arguably "Infinity War's" MVP, Thor levelled-up his weaponry and so nearly killed Thanos.Chris Hemsworth has said he's out of contract after "Endgame," but after the roaring success of Thor's last solo outing "Ragnarok," it doesn't feel like the Norse god has run his course.Dead or alive?Strong chance Thor lives.Valkyrie Current status: Alive Critics agreed that Tessa Thompson knocked it out the park as warrior drunk Valkyrie in "Ragnarok," and there's plenty of room for this character to grow.Marvel Studios know an asset when they see one.Dead or alive?Only just beginning to spread her wings.She lives.Vision Current status: Dead Whatever lies beyond the mortal plane, Vision still probably has a killer migraine after Thanos ripped the Mind Stone from his forehead.His story arc has arguably run its course, but an upcoming Disney+ series alongside Scarlet Witch would likely make him indispensable.Dead or alive?Probably going to survive, proving you can never keep a part-android, part-space gem down.War Machine Current status: Alive James Rhodes survived the snap, but as a long-term vet of the MCU and with associates likely to die in "Endgmae," the next chapter for the colonel is murky.Dead or alive?This could go either way.Assuming Stark dies, donning the Iron Man suit wouldn't be a big leap for War Machine.On the other hand, with no Tony Stark to keep in check, Rhodes loses some of his raison d'etre.But paralyzing him, fixing him with robotic legs, only to kill him would be a cold, cold move.Wasp Current status: Dead Killed by the snap that brought the end of "Ant-Man and the Wasp" in line with "Infinity War," Evangeline Lilly's Hope van Dyne has only had two outings in the Marvel films.Lilly's badinage with Paul Rudd's Steve Lang was one of the best things about the Ant-Man sequel, and there's no reason why that need come to an end -- unless to lend emotional heft to as-yet-unannounced "Ant-Man 3."Dead or alive?Likely to survive, but not a lock.Wong Current status: Alive Not a huge presence in "Infinity War" (someone has to protect the Sanctum Sanctorum), Wong will likely be thrust into the action in "Endgame," especially given his knowledge of the mystic arts.Dead or alive?Doctor Strange is going to need a friend in his next standalone, and their budding bromance has room to grow.He lives.Bonus: Thanos Current status: Alive The Mad Titan's victory at the end of the last chapter wasn't surprising, but the manner of it shocked audiences.It also prompted a deluge of think pieces asking if, in an epoch of unsustainable resource consumption, he was really the villain after all.But while Thanos won the battle for the universe, he's never going to win the war.That's just not how superhero movies work.Dead or alive?He should enjoy his retirement while he still can.Definitely dying."Avengers: Endgame" arrives in cinemas in international territories beginning April 24 and in the US April 26.
Just a 'Little' black girl magic:::::(CNN) Marsai Martin might want to work a little harder.At least that's the joke her "Little" co-stars Issa Rae and Regina Hall made to CNN when asked why there haven't been more films like theirs, starring young actors of color."Cause she's lazy," Hall teased Martin."One movie and you're 14 already.""'Oh, I just started a production company just now,'" Rae said, pretending to be Martin."I've been busy, I'm sorry," Martin said in a mock exasperated teen voice.Indeed she has.As one of the stars of ABC's hit comedy "Black-ish," Martin already had plenty on her plate.But when she was 13 she strolled into a pitch meeting with Universal Studios to suggest a reboot of the 1988 Tom Hanks hit, "Big," modernized with a black female cast."The pitch meeting was actually pretty smooth," Martin told CNN."I wasn't nervous at all, because I didn't even know what nervous or afraid even meant."The meeting eventually evolved, Martin said, into those gathered sharing memories from their childhoods.The young actress said she went to the "Little" pitch meeting dressed in a blazer to embody her character in the film, Jordan Sanders, the temperamental business woman who wakes up one morning having been thrust back to childhood.Hall portrays Jordan as an adult.The pair said they worked closely together to create continuity for their character."We talked a little bit before we actually started shooting and then we kind of grew with Jordan," Martin said."Regina was on set every single day.She was watching my scenes and I would watch hers to actually get the feel of what Jordan would be like."And while the movie is based on the beloved "Big," Rae, who portrays Jordan's much put upon assistant April Williams, said "Little" stands on its own. "allowfullscreen> "People are going to compare, but we really tried to make our own thing," she said."Little's" director Tina Gordon said body-swapping movies are such a popular genre that she focused more on character development than the fact it's a reboot."I actually just delve deep into the characters and who those women would be, which is what you have to do, breathing life into any piece that you're writing," she said."Those characters are what make the story new."That's where the black girl magic comes in.Not only is the movie about black female characters, conceived of and starring a young, black woman and directed by a black woman, but it also offers black women of all ages the opportunity to see themselves on the big screen.Will Packer produced "Little" and hopes it will create more opportunities for family films told from a black perspective, much like Jordan Peele's success with "Us" is stoking interest in black horror films and "Black Panther" has Hollywood on the lookout for the next big, black superhero movie."I think the world itself is changing, and so now you're going to see films that feel more diverse and more inclusive," Packer said before adding, "Remember we're starting from such a deficit that now that there's more, it doesn't mean that we're anywhere near where we need to be."Martin aims to do her part to get the industry there.She's already made history with "Little" as the youngest person to ever executive produce a major Hollywood film.The teen will star in "StepMonster," a comedy about a young girl trying to navigate life with her stepmother.Rae and Hall joked that they're cast in that film as well and teased their young co-star about a possible "Little" sequel, with Rae lamenting, "Marsai, work harder!"So will there be a "Little" sequel?"We have to figure out how this 'Little' does first before there's a 'Little' sequel," Martin laughed."That's the answer."
'Veep' and 'Barry' are a winning comedy ticket:::::(CNN) "Game of Thrones" isn't the only HBO stalwart coming to an end this spring, as "Veep" begins its final campaign.The network has paired it with a worthy running mate in season two of "Barry," the dark comedy about a hit man suddenly bitten by the acting bug.The writers of "Veep" have joked that the current political climate has essentially lapped the three-time Emmy winner, which has been away for longer than usual as Julia Louis-Dreyfus has dealt with treatment for cancer.(HBO and CNN share parent company WarnerMedia.)The timing, however, could hardly be better, as the show's seventh season finds Louis-Dreyfus' Selina Meyer embarking on a new presidential run, unleashing a comedy of errors as she begins by crisscrossing Iowa, attending events and meeting people for whom she privately harbors nothing but disdain.Indeed, in "Veep" voters aren't there to be served, but merely the means to an end.Similarly, mass shootings aren't viewed as tragedies but rather political opportunities or impediments, depending on the details.The wanton cynicism that permeates the series seems even funnier now, although its refusal to identify Selina's party affiliation has always felt a bit strained.At this point, though, that's easier to forgive, especially in exchange for lines like Selina talking about how disgusting America has become, to which aide Kent (Gary Cole) flatly replies, "That's a demo we're targeting mostly on Facebook."Read More
'The Twilight Zone' gets a makeover for the 'Black Mirror' age:::::(CNN) Rod Serling's classic "The Twilight Zone" made its debut almost 60 years ago, but each generation seems destined for its own revival.The latest incarnation, courtesy of streaming site CBS All Access, tries to give the sci-fi anthology a new coat of "Black Mirror" polish, with intriguing but mixed results.Riding high after directing "Get Out" and now "Us," Jordan Peele has overseen the reboot with Simon Kinberg (a veteran of the "X-Men" franchise), and they have brought the concept to life with both knowing winks to nostalgia and a clear desire to upgrade it for the current moment.The format, moreover, is a casting boon, enticing marquee actors to drop in for an episode.The four episodes previewed, however, feel a bit more hit-miss than one might have hoped.Some of the stories have firm roots in previous versions of the show, the most obvious being "Nightmare at 30,000 Feet," a title that recalls not only the gremlin-on-a-plane original featuring William Shatner but the 1983 movie that cast John Lithgow in the role.Here, the danger isn't on the wing, but in the cabin -- and perhaps the head of a frazzled passenger (Adam Scott), who is convinced the plane he's aboard is going to crash.It's the weakest of the four hours, whereas another about a time-zapping camcorder proves the most provocative and urgent, with a concerned mother (Sanaa Lathan) desperately trying to use the device to protect her college-bound son ("Snowfall's" Damson Idris), triggering unforeseen consequences with each rewind.Jordan Peele hosts 'The Twilight Zone' Kumail Nanjiani, meanwhile, plays a struggling comedian who discovers the means to achieve fame, albeit at considerable cost; and Steven Yeun is a mysterious prisoner in a remote Alaskan town, in an installment that hews most closely to the Cold War/alien invasion paranoia that was one of the original's most salient themes.Read More
Hollywood writers escalate war with lawsuit against talent agencies:::::Los Angeles (CNN Business) The Writers Guild of America has escalated its war against talent agents, filing a lawsuit on Wednesday against the four major agencies that seeks to establish the illegality of the practice of packaging fees.The guild and eight writers are acting as plaintiffs in the case, which was filed in California Superior Court against William Morris Endeavor, Creative Artists Agency, ICM Partners and United Talent Agency.The guild announced the lawsuit after hopes for a negotiated settlement with the agencies ended without an agreement.Since then, guild members have been urged to fire their agents , arguing that they need "unconflicted representation."The somewhat arcane nature of the dispute has made it difficult for the guild to convey the issues that are at stake, which was evident in some of the questions its representatives fielded at the press conference on Wednesday.David Simon, creator of the hit show "The Wire," has been critical of packaging fees.The major agencies commonly collect what are known as packaging fees, which are payments for assembling multiple clients -- say, a writer, actor and director -- into a "package" for a TV studio.The fees collected include a percentage of profits from TV shows.The writers maintain the system leads to abuse, and that agents should receive a flat 10% of their clients' income, which, as writer Meredith Stiehm said, "aligns agencies financial incentives with their client."Read More

How Late-Night TV Took on the Redacted Mueller Report:::::The Mueller investigation fueled countless late-night monologues and sketches over the last two years, and Thursday's release of the 448-page report was no exception.Late night hosts Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert peppered their Thursday night routines with material from the report, cracking jokes about months of speculation from Washington and the media, parodying the report in song and quipping about its contents.In his recurring "A Closer Look" segment, Meyers joked on "Late Night" about speculation that Mueller's investigation was "winding down," even as far back as 15 months ago."They've been saying the Mueller report was about to come out forever," Meyers said."In fact, true story, when they found those 20,000-year-old cave paintings in France, one of them just said, 'Is Mueller wrapping up?'"After Attorney General William Barr's pre-release news conference, the report was delivered to Congress on CDs, which Meyers thought was hilarious: "They got the Mueller report the same way we all got Encarta."On "The Tonight Show," Jimmy Fallon took a musical approach to lambast the report's 900+ redactions, set to the tune of The Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.""I can't take more, more redactions," he sang, accompanied by The Roots."I can't read those Trump infractions.But I try, try to find, what they hide, 'neath the lines."In his opening monologue, Fallon got into the report itself, quoting Trump's reaction to first learning that special counsel Robert Mueller would be investigating potential contacts between his campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election.According to the report, Trump said, "Oh my God.This is terrible.This is the end of my presidency.I'm f*****."Fallon quipped about Trump's personal attorney: "Keep in mind, Trump says the same thing every time Rudy Giuliani goes on TV."On "The Late Show," Stephen Colbert took aim at how Barr characterized the report before it was released.Barr was roundly criticized by Democrats, who said he distorted the contents of the report in his news conference and unduly defended the president."Now, until this morning, no one knew what was in this thing," Colbert said."We hadn't read it.Congress hadn't read it.And evidently, Bill Barr hadn't read it either because there's some insane s*** in here."Colbert also commented on the revelation that White House counsel Don McGahn said Trump asked him to "do crazy s***," a reference to Trump once asking McGahn to fire Mueller in 2017.Colbert said, "I for one don't know what McGahn is complaining about.He had to see this coming.After all, that was Trump's 2016 campaign slogan."

How Late-Night TV Took on the Redacted Mueller Report:::::The Mueller investigation fueled countless late-night monologues and sketches over the last two years, and Thursday's release of the 448-page report was no exception.Late night hosts Seth Meyers, Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert peppered their Thursday night routines with material from the report, cracking jokes about months of speculation from Washington and the media, parodying the report in song and quipping about its contents.In his recurring "A Closer Look" segment, Meyers joked on "Late Night" about speculation that Mueller's investigation was "winding down," even as far back as 15 months ago."They've been saying the Mueller report was about to come out forever," Meyers said."In fact, true story, when they found those 20,000-year-old cave paintings in France, one of them just said, 'Is Mueller wrapping up?'"After Attorney General William Barr's pre-release news conference, the report was delivered to Congress on CDs, which Meyers thought was hilarious: "They got the Mueller report the same way we all got Encarta."On "The Tonight Show," Jimmy Fallon took a musical approach to lambast the report's 900+ redactions, set to the tune of The Rolling Stones' "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction.""I can't take more, more redactions," he sang, accompanied by The Roots."I can't read those Trump infractions.But I try, try to find, what they hide, 'neath the lines."In his opening monologue, Fallon got into the report itself, quoting Trump's reaction to first learning that special counsel Robert Mueller would be investigating potential contacts between his campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election.According to the report, Trump said, "Oh my God.This is terrible.This is the end of my presidency.I'm f*****."Fallon quipped about Trump's personal attorney: "Keep in mind, Trump says the same thing every time Rudy Giuliani goes on TV."On "The Late Show," Stephen Colbert took aim at how Barr characterized the report before it was released.Barr was roundly criticized by Democrats, who said he distorted the contents of the report in his news conference and unduly defended the president."Now, until this morning, no one knew what was in this thing," Colbert said."We hadn't read it.Congress hadn't read it.And evidently, Bill Barr hadn't read it either because there's some insane s*** in here."Colbert also commented on the revelation that White House counsel Don McGahn said Trump asked him to "do crazy s***," a reference to Trump once asking McGahn to fire Mueller in 2017.Colbert said, "I for one don't know what McGahn is complaining about.He had to see this coming.After all, that was Trump's 2016 campaign slogan."

Ray, wrote that "some of the best minds from the corporate world" participated in the meeting, the large majority of them people of color."They made great demands," Dapper Dan wrote."It's time for Gucci to answer.That is supposed to happen today."He said he would announce a town hall meeting in Harlem to talk about how the community feels about Gucci's proposals once those proposals have been received.It wasn't clear who else was in attendance at Friday's meeting; Dapper Dan said in a post Sunday that Gucci's CEO had agreed to fly from Italy to Harlem this week to discuss the matter with community and industry leaders.Cyrus Stuns in Never-Before-Seen Photos From Her Wedding Day Miley Cyrus can't stop thinking about her wedding!In honor of Valentine's Day, the "Rainbowland" singer shared a handful of never-before-seen photos from her big day, including a silly photo with her groom, Liam Hemsworth.Take a peek into Miley's celebration.(Published Friday, Feb. 15, 2019) "There is no excuse nor apology that can erase this kind of insult," he wrote in that Sunday post."There cannot be inclusivity without accountability."Gucci has apologized for the turtleneck black wool balaclava-style sweater, which covered the nose and included a red cut-out for the mouth.The fashion house pulled it from online and physical stores, saying in a statement it was committed to diversity and considered it a "fundamental value to be fully upheld, respected and at the forefront of every decision we make."Earlier this week, Gucci's creative director broke his silence on the matter, saying racism was never his intention.Alessandro Michele, a design force at the Italian fashion house, lamented in a letter to employees both his own pain and "that of the people who saw in one of my creative projects an intolerable insult."Michele wrote the sweater was not inspired by blackface but by the late Leigh Bowery, a performance artist, club promoter and fashion designer who often used flamboyant face makeup and costumes.Nonetheless, he said he took "full accountability" for the sweater.Dapper Dan has had previous qualms with the brand which appeared to copy one of his designs in 2017, but more recently partnered with the fashion house to open the Gucci Dapper Dan Atelier Studio, an homage to his original Dapper Dan Boutique in Harlem.Fitness Star Lewin Bitten by Wild Pig During Photo Shoot
Reports of Smollett Attack Being Hoax Are 'Inaccurate': Cops:::::The Chicago Police Department threw cold water on reports Thursday night that "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett staged his own attack in response to his character being written off of the show.Natalie Martinez reports.(Published Thursday, Feb. 14, 2019) The Chicago Police Department threw cold water on reports Thursday night that "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett staged his own attack in response to his character being written off of the show."Media reports anout the Empire incident being a hoax are unconfirmed by case detectives," CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi tweeted."Supt Eddie Johnson has contacted @ABC7Chicago to state on the record that we have no evidence to support their reporting and their supposed CPD sources are uninformed and inaccurate."A CBS reporter also tweeted the theory, citing "top sources."A statement from 20th Century Fox Television, which produces "Empire," also denied that Smollett was being taken off the show.The idea that Jussie Smollett has been, or would be, written off of EMPIRE is patently ridiculous," it reads."He remains a core player on this very successful series and we continue to stand behind him."Police said earlier in the day they have identified two persons of interest in the alleged attack on "Empire" star Jussie Smollett.Guglielmi said the two persons of interest were picked up at O'Hare Airport Wednesday night and were being questioned as of Thursday morning."After a meticulous investigation with the use of advance technology, interviews with the victim and witnesses and transportation records, detectives have identified two persons of interest in the Empire cast member case," police said in a statement.The latest development comes on the same morning Smollett's first television interview since the alleged attack aired.We are pleased there is progress in the case and are waiting to hear further details," a spokesperson for Smollett said in a statement.Smollett told police on Jan. 29 that two masked men punched him, subjected him to racist and homophobic insults, threw an "unknown chemical substance" on him and put a thin rope around his neck before fleeing.Smollett's account to detectives included that his attackers yelled that he was in "MAGA country," an apparent reference to the Trump campaign's "Make America Great Again" slogan that some critics of the president have decried as racist and discriminatory.The alleged attack occurred in the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street about 2 a.m. as the actor returned home from an early-morning visit to a Subway restaurant, according to the police report.Smollett said in the interview that he was left in shock after the incident and inititally didnt want to report it to police."I was looking at myself, just like checking myself out.I saw the bruise on my neck, you know, like the little -- the rope burn around my neck," he said."So when the police came I kept the clothes on, I kept the rope on me...I mean, it wasn't, like, wrapped around.But, yeah, it was around because I wanted them to see."Smollett said he's "pissed off" not just by the attack itself but by those questioning his story."For me, the main thing was the idea that I somehow switched up my story, you know?And that somehow maybe I added a little extra trinket, you know, of the MAGA thing," Smollett said."I didn't need to add anything like that.They called me a f-----, they called me a n------.There's no which way you cut it.I don't need some MAGA hat as the cherry on top of some racist sundae."The Chicago police report lists the weapon in the alleged attack as "hand, feet, teeth, etc.""He is a victim," Chicago police Supt.Eddie Johnson recently said of Smollett."And we treat him like a victim.He's been very cooperative."Hours of surveillance video from multiple cameras in the area where Smollett says the attack happened have been reviewed.Smollett handed over redacted phone records to Chicago police Monday, but authorities said the records "do not meet the burden for a criminal investigation as they were limted and heavily redacted."A representative for Smollett said the redacted records were to protect the privacy of his contacts."They wanted me to give my phone to the tech for three to four hours.I'm sorry but -- I'm not gonna do that," Smollett said in the interview."Because I have private pictures and videos and numbers: my partner's number, my family's number, my castmate's number, my friends' numbers, my private emails, my private songs, my private voice memos."Only one image has been released of possible "persons of interest.""I don't have any doubt in my mind that that's them," Smollett said."Never did."

Influencers: How a 'new breed' of social media stars changed the game:::::Image copyright Getty/Models 1 Image caption L-R: Kylie Jenner, The Bloom Twins and Natasha Ndlovu Your last name doesn't have to be Jenner or Kardashian to be able to make a living from social media posts, as a new generation of influencers and "micro-influencers" are proving.It's perfectly possible you've never heard of James Charles.Birmingham City Council clearly hadn't.They were rather taken by surprise by the thousands of fans who brought the city centre to a standstill when he appeared for a meet-and-greet at the Bullring in January.Charles is just one example of an influencer - a social media star who may not be an A-list celebrity by conventional standards, but inspires a cult-like following among fans, which is then often used to build an empire.Huda Kattan, for example, has been described as "the Bill Gates of beauty influencers" for quitting her job and, with the help of social media, launching her own company, which is now valued at more than $1bn (760m).So how should an influencer be defined?"It's someone who has some influence which they can monetise," explains SJ Nooth-Cooper, a senior manager at Models 1 Talent - an agency which now signs influencers as well as models."And they have a USP.So whether it's beauty, fashion, cooking, mental health, being a chef, they can use that to make a business out of it.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption James Charles (pictured with Kim Kardashian) is well known for his make-up and beauty posts "Everyone wants their hobby to be their job... and many people that we've worked with, they've quit their jobs and been able to go 'wow, I'm earning from this one post what I would otherwise have been earning in a month'."For the generation who grew up studying traditional subjects at school, that can be a difficult concept to get your head around.Natasha Ndlovu, who has built up 90,000 followers on Instagram with her fashion and beauty posts, says the very term influencer can be a "heated" word."I guess that's because there's still that generation, that group in society, that thinks we're a bit obnoxious," Ndlovu says.But, she acknowledges, it's understandable that many don't comprehend why it has become a profession in its own right.She recalls the confusion on a postman's face when he began delivering a large number of products which were being sent to her by brands when she first launched her blog several years ago."I get a lot of mail.So a lot of the delivery people know who I am, they see me more than they see most people down the street," she explains."And so one time, one guy casually said, 'You seem to get a lot of packages', and I said, 'I'm a blogger'.And he was like, 'what's that?'"Ndlovu then explained that she reviewed products online, but laughs: "I think he was still confused."Influencers generally make money from endorsing products on their page - which have to be clearly labelled as advertisements because of Advertising Standards Authority rules.A brand may identify an influencer who has a specific audience they're trying to reach, and pay to appear on their social media feeds in the same way they'd previously have paid for magazine advertisements.The buzz surrounding influencers has led to major media companies taking them very seriously indeed.News UK, which owns The Times and The Sun, announced last month it was creating an independent influencer agency.'Generation Z' But while only a few influencers like Kylie Jenner are household names, there are thousands of "micro-influencers" who are able to make a living from being a big name within a specific, often niche, field."Micro-influencers are basically the new breed," says Nooth-Cooper, "where you can have from around 10,000 followers to 25,000 followers, and they're kind of the Generation Z of influencers."Sophie Grace Holmes, an influencer with cystic fibrosis, encourages her followers to lead healthy lifestyles and not to be held back if they have a condition like hers.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sophie Grace Holmes (right, pictured with Lucy Spicer) endorses health and fitness products Her 34,000 followers might be a few short of Jenner's 131 million, but because Holmes has such a specific audience, brands are keen to collaborate with her."For me, I'm really passionate about inspiring and motivating other people," she says."My mission in life is to show what you can do when you've been given either the idea that you shouldn't or can't be able to do something."Generally, Holmes promotes brands and products related to health and fitness - recent endorsements include Holland & Barrett and gym wear brand Beachbody.But, she says, she will only endorse something she genuinely believes in, and which might benefit her audience in some way."If I'm going to work with a brand, I have to make sure that it will aid what I'm doing for my health, my training, fitness, nutrition," she explains."My main focus isn't to be paid, it's to have an impact on other people, to push them.I wouldn't just advertise out of wanting to be paid."Ndlovu has a similarly specific audience, who rely on her opinions on fashion and make-up."As a darker-skin woman, when it comes to the high-end beauty brands, people need to know if it's worth investing in an expensive foundation, because it's very difficult to find high street foundations for darker skin tones."But there are difficulties in becoming known for a particular hobby or cause.Not least, integrity.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Forbes named Kylie Jenner the world's youngest self-made billionaire earlier this year How can followers trust someone's taste and recommendations when they're usually being paid to promote particular products?"Consumers are too savvy and too bored by endorsements and flat product mentions," suggested RocketMill's senior creative strategist Bethanie Mardon in an article for The Drum."They are influenced by the influencers they choose to follow, largely because they relate to them and trust them."But in December, research for BBC Radio 4 showed most consumers mistrust influencers, with 82% saying it's not always clear when someone has been paid to promote a product.'Be a role model' Many influencers point out, though, they don't accept every deal they're offered."I say no to a lot more stuff than I say yes to," says Nooth-Cooper."The way that we manage talent, it's all about the longevity, and the micro-influencer becoming that absolute authority."And they have their integrity... they have to be honest about ads and sponsored or gifted posts, but people are following them because they know they wouldn't say yes to everything."Among Nooth-Cooper's clients are The Bloom Twins, Sonia and Anna, who say they wouldn't put their name to anything they didn't believe in."We have so many photos that would have been very successful on Instagram, but they're not us," says Sonia."So we're only going to post something that reflects who we are, and that could be us wearing pyjamas and eating ice cream."All three - Holmes, Ndlovu and The Bloom Twins - make the point that they sometimes keep the more light-hearted or less-polished posts to their Instagram stories, which, unlike images posted in the grid, expire after 24 hours.Fashion designers have quickly come to appreciate the value that an influencer can bring to their brand."Today, you have to ask yourself, what is more important, to have Kim Kardashian in the front row, or [US Vogue editor] Anna Wintour?It's a hard decision to make," Philipp Plein told BBC News last year.But Anna from The Bloom Twins warns against people becoming influencers solely for the purposes of earning money or becoming famous."Don't be an influencer just for the sake of it, be a role model," she advises."If there's something you want to say, talk about it, so people can relate to it."It doesn't matter if you have 20 or 20,000 followers, if you talk about it, it might make a difference to someone's life.If you help someone, if you influence somebody, you're an influencer."
Game of Thrones: Amazon error as second episode is uploaded early:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Emilia Clarke plays Daenerys Targaryen in HBO's popular fantasy series The latest episode of Game of Thrones was uploaded to Amazon early due to an "error", the company has said.The second instalment of the eighth and final series was not supposed to be broadcast until Sunday evening.But some Amazon Prime members were able to watch it several hours before that."We regret that for a short time Amazon customers in Germany were able to access episode two of season eight of Game of Thrones," an Amazon spokesman said."This was an error and has been rectified."It may have been taken down soon after it was uploaded, but it was long enough for many fans to view the whole episode.As a result, screengrabs and plot details started appearing online before the official broadcast - which led to fans worrying about accidentally coming across spoilers (which we obviously won't post here).However, plenty of people had some fun with the leak.US singer Mariah Carey suggested that she was about to post some "major Game of Thrones spoilers" on Twitter... before going on to upload a picture of herself on the Iron Throne.This is the second week in a row that Game of Thrones has appeared online early.Last week's launch episode was made available to DirecTV Now customers four hours early.A spokesman for AT&T, which owns the service, said: "Apparently our system was as excited as we are for Game of Thrones tonight and gave a few DirecTV Now customers early access to the episode by mistake."When we became aware of the error, we immediately fixed it and we look forward to tuning in this evening."Writing in Forbes, Paul Tassi said: "HBO has to be tearing their hair out that this keeps happening, but this show is so popular and there are so many of these markets to manage, it does almost seem inevitable that something will go wrong."At least we're not dealing with people flat-out stealing episodes like we saw in a breach a few years ago, but this is not great either."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
UB40's Brian Travers to 'live life to the full' after surgery:::::Image copyright Getty Images UB40 saxophonist Brian Travers says he will "carry on living life to the full" after having two brain tumours removed.The founding member of the Birmingham band, who topped the charts in 1983 with Red Red Wine, added that he does not plan to give up alcohol or smoking.In March, the 60-year-old had a seizure at his home and was later found to have two tumours on his brain.He underwent surgery on 29 March, the day UB40's latest tour kicked off, which he was forced to miss.Interviewed by Birmingham's Sunday Mercury, the musician said he had a new lease of life following the surgery."Kids, don't start smoking.It's a no-brainer," he told the newspaper."But I told the docs I wasn't going to give up booze, I wasn't going to give up fags and I wasn't going to give up recreational drugs."I love them all and they give me my serotonin, which makes me happy and creative to do my art.I'll do anything that makes me happy.From scoring music to writing stuff, I'll do anything to get my brain motivated."He added: "I haven't got a bucket list like so many people who suddenly reach a point and reveal all the things they wished they'd done."I've got no regrets.I've lived my life to the full and I'm going to carry on living it to the full - I'm a rock 'n' roller!Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brian Travers performing with Ali Campbell and the rest of UB40 at Rewind Scotland last year "I have never felt more alive, and I am bursting with ambition.I have never had a greater gift than this operation.I am going to make some great art, and I am so excited."Travers told of how he "wet the bed" during his seizure, the first one he had ever experienced, and that "all I could see was darkness" when he woke up later.He was taken to hospital and had an MRI scan, where the double tumour in his frontal cortex was discovered.He will now undergo chemotherapy in tablet form and he will have radiotherapy five times a week.In a statement last month, UB40 said they were "deeply saddened that Brian, our lifelong friend and founding member of UB40, is unable to join us for our celebratory UK tour."We know he will be missed by all but his health and well-being come first, and we are sure our friends and fans will join us in wishing Brian a full and speedy return to health, and return to us."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

or MCU for short - is the shared place where all 22 films featuring the comic book characters are set.Each tells its own distinct story but also connects with other films in the MCU, to tell an overarching tale.It's a technique Marvel Comics pioneer Stan Lee also used in his comics.The MCU is the most successful film franchise of all time, making more than $18.2bn (13.7bn) to date.What order should I watch the films in?We suggest you watch the films in chronological order, rather than the order in which the films were released.Handily, in the book Marvel Studios: The First 10 Years, Marvel released an official MCU timeline to help you do just that.We've added the films released since that book came out and voila, here is a handy diagram to help you organise your Marvel viewing!Just one geeky note on the diagram.Technically the main events of Ant-Man and the Wasp happen before Infinity War, but we suggest you watch it afterwards to fully appreciate the post-credits scenes, which takes place later.Why did Marvel start with these characters?In 2007, Marvel was recovering from bankruptcy and had sold off the film rights to some of the company's most popular characters like the X-Men and Spider-Man.Marvel still owned the superheroes who form the core Avengers team - Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor and Captain America - so used the early MCU films to introduce these heroes.Marvel then brought these characters together for the crossover film Avengers Assemble.You can see a list of all the current members of The Avengers here.The crossover was planned from the very beginning.The first MCU film released, Iron Man, included a post-credits scene in which Samuel L Jackson's super spy Nick Fury gives the first mention of the Avengers.I don't have time to watch all the films!What can I skip?Image copyright Disney Image caption Make like Thanos and halve the size of the MCU Endgame is the finale of a series of 22 films.But, don't worry, you don't need to watch every single one to be fully prepared.Here are the 10 films you could skip and still understand the basics of Endgame.The Incredible Hulk -

whatever happens, it will take time for Endgame's story to unfold.It's the longest entry in the MCU so far, clocking in at three hours and two minutes.That's the same length as the first instalment in Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy, An Unexpected Journey (2012).What's the future of the MCU?Image copyright Disney Image caption Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), probably reacting to rumours that one of the core Avengers team might not make it through Endgame alive We can expect a major shake-up of the MCU, in the wake of Endgame.Phase Four begins with the release of Spider-Man: Far from Home on July 5 2019.According to producer Amy Pascal, the film "will start a few minutes after Avengers 4 wraps as a story".Tom Holland's Spidey was one of many heroes wiped out in Thanos's Snap in Infinity War, but given his starring role in this film, we can expect he'll be alive and well before the Endgame credits roll.New films involving other supposedly dead characters have also been confirmed for Phase Four.Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has confirmed Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange will return for a sequel at "some point in the future".Chadwick Boseman is also likely to recover from his disintegration in time for Black Panther 2.We also know a third Guardians of the Galaxy film has been confirmed, after Disney re-hired director James Gunn, but we don't know which Guardians will return for it.At the end of Infinity War, Bradley Cooper's Rocket and Karen Gillan's Nebula were the only survivors from that franchise.Feige has also hinted that Phase Four could include a solo sequel for Brie Larson's Captain Marvel.Also in development are new films involving super-powered beings called the Eternals, and martial artist superhero Shang-Chi.Which Marvel characters aren't in the MCU?Image copyright 20th Century Fox Image caption Dark Phoenix, which stars Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner, is likely to be the last time the X-Men appear outside the MCU You might be confused about why some Marvel characters appear in films that don't connect to the MCU.The reason for this is actually simple.Long before Marvel Studios existed, Marvel Entertainment had sold the rights to some of its characters to other filmmakers.Spider-Man was sold to Sony.The studio made a Spider-Man trilogy starring Tobey Maguire, and soon afterwards rebooted the franchise less successfully with Andrew Garfield as the webslinger.However, Sony and Marvel have now agreed a partnership that allows Tom Holland's Spider-Man to appear in MCU films, while Sony retains the rights to the character.Sony also owned the rights to Ghost Rider, and made two films about him starring Nicolas Cage, until the rights reverted back to Marvel in 2013.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Nicolas Cage, possibly hoping some strategically placed Ghost Rider branding might inspire Marvel bosses to greenlight a new film The Fantastic Four series and the X-Men were sold to 20th Century Fox, though Marvel Studios expect to regain the rights to both properties this year due to a merger between Disney and Fox.The merger means Marvel could introduce these characters into the MCU in future films.Fox also made the Deadpool movies, starring Ryan Reynolds, which sit firmly outside the MCU.It's not clear what the future holds for this franchise, as the foul-mouthed, pansexual superhero is certainly not the most family friendly character.However, the Deadpool films were a commercial success and star Ryan Reynolds has hinted on social media that he'd like there to be a future for the character with Disney.Fox also owned the rights to Daredevil, in 2003 producing a film starring Ben Affleck, and the 2005 spin-off film Elektra, before the rights reverted back to Marvel.Universal's Hulk films and New Line Cinema's Blade Films were also the result of deals struck before the rights to those characters reverted back to Marvel, and don't belong within the MCU.I've seen all the MCU films.What else can I watch?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Clark Gregg looks very pleased that his character got resurrected, so he can keep cashing those Marvel cheques Don't worry.There are plenty of TV shows set in the MCU to keep you going.Agent Carter -

The special flavour of rock’n’roll Beijing:::::Image copyright Getty Images The indie bands of the Chinese capital, Beijing, have their own raw, distinctive sound, says the BBC's Stephen McDonell - partly because they are so isolated from the rest of the rock'n'roll world.High-top black Feiyue sneakers hit the effects pedal, drums and guitars kick in and a surge of bodies moves to the sound.Cheap beer, smoky air, raucous noise; cluttered, ramshackle and bohemian this is Beijing's underground music scene.Local bands are cult heroes in the dive bars of the old city: young people from all round China drift to the capital because this is where alternative music is taken seriously.People will tell you that Beijing is a rock'n'roll city.Image copyright Stephen McDonell Image caption PK14 - "a nerdy, cool, shaking, high-energy, poetic explosion of music" Of course you can hear outstanding symphonies or jazz here.There are plays, there's dance, and there's still traditional Chinese music like Peking opera on offer.But the country's indie bands are dealing with the China of today - meaning, they know they have to be careful what they say and how they say it.A few years ago you could actually get away with more than you can now.One winter's night, in a venue which has since closed, a punk band came on.At one point, in between the thrashing guitars, the lead singer declared in English: "The Chinese Communist Party is the mafia!"An audible wooooooo could be heard around the room as people laughed at the audacity of such a public statement.Just a few hundred metres south of the bar, a generation earlier, the People's Liberation Army had rolled in tanks to crush the 1989 student protest movement.Politics here is serious and can get you into trouble.But Beijing's music-bar owners seem pretty blase about the prospect of being closed down or arrested because of subversive lyrics.Most musicians seem to know, somehow, the limits of what can be said.They push up against the edge - and when they cross the line, they usually do so in a clever, cryptic fashion.I could provide examples of songs and expressions - but their wordplay can take a while to explain, and it might draw unwelcome attention for the bands concerned.That's how things are in China.And let's not forget, most artists here sing mostly about young love, heartbreak, hangovers, the streets where they live, the people they miss.Image copyright Getty Images From Our Own Correspondent has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world has insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, get the podcast or listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Saturdays at 11:30 Some will wonder what's so special about Beijing and bands.It's not as if the city invented rock'n'roll.What created what we might describe as a "Beijing sound" has been isolation.It's not that the young rockers of China have never heard of David Bowie or the Foo Fighters, it's that few international bands play here.So, if you want to go and see some live music, it's odds-on to be a Chinese band.Like Sydney's music scene in the 1980s, Beijing's today has a special flavour, accentuated by being further away and less visited.The sound itself is raw, less polished, with mountains of enthusiasm and commitment to nothing more than the love of music for its own sake.Players know they're never going to be on television in China, never going to be played on the radio here.Their fans hear their music by coming to the gigs.Popularity spreads by word of mouth.Image caption The Mao Livehouse in 2013 - the venue has since closed There's a sense that everyone is equal.The most famous band will not necessarily be the headline act.The line-up is often drawn out of a hat and the set lists can be completely random.One bar owner told me that a government official had visited his venue and his main concern was that patrons had nowhere to sit.He just couldn't understand why people would want to stand during a performance.Probably best that he didn't come along to witness a heaving mosh pit first hand.Image copyright Stephen McDonell Image caption Ricky Sixx has switched from heavy metal to funk - his goal is to be China's Prince Still, planning permission and licensing laws have been whittling away at the scene, with venue after venue closing its doors.Once, all you needed to set up a performance space was a room, an amplifier and beer.Not any more.Now you need a proper licence, and the city government has decided to clear many businesses out of the old alleyway, or hutong, neighbourhoods.Image copyright Stephen McDonell Image caption Silent Speech playing at School Bar Yet the biggest threat to the Beijing blast is probably rent.The music circuit is mostly in the old heart of the city, where once-rundown spaces have now become sought after, trendy locations.Owners tend to live off-site, and want better returns on their investment.So running such a venue is a labour of love.But there they are still standing: Yue Space, School Bar, Dusk to Dawn with live bands playing most nights.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hell City at the Beijing Punk Festival in 2014 I remember the first time I saw PK 14 play.They'd turn heads at any international music festival.Who did they remind me of?Was it early Talking Heads or Joy Division?Not really.This nerdy, cool, shaking, high-energy, poetic explosion of music was all their own, with Chinese lyrics pelting out over syncopated drum rhythms and thrashing guitars.You can't get this anywhere else: you have to come to Beijing.I hope it lasts.You may also be interested in: It's becoming normal for grown-up children to spend years at home even after starting work, because of the mismatch between salaries and rents.Sue Elliott-Nicholls and her son, Morgan Elliott, agree that it can be a nightmare.Housemates from hell: Me and my 23-year-old son Join the conversation -

Adele splits from husband Simon Konecki:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Adele and Simon Konecki married in secret in 2016 Adele has separated from her husband Simon Konecki, representatives for the singer have confirmed.In a statement on Friday, they said the pair were "committed to raising their son together lovingly".Adele gave birth to her son, Angelo, in 2012.She married Konecki - an investment banker turned charity boss - in 2016 after five years of dating.The best-selling London-born artist is known for her chart-topping albums 19, 21 and 25.The statement added that the pair were asking for privacy and there would be no further comment.They married in secret and Adele first addressed the wedding publicly during an acceptance speech at the 2017 Grammys, where she thanked her "husband".The singer's debut album, which was released in 2008 and featured hits including Chasing Pavements and Hometown Glory, reached number one in the UK.She went on to win a string of awards and her follow-up, 21, topped the charts in 30 countries including the US and the UK.Her third album, 25, sold a record-breaking 800,000 copies in its first week and became the best-selling album of 2015.In March, Adele, 30, was pictured entering a recording studio in New York City, prompting speculation that she was working on new music.Konecki, 45, left his job at Lehman Brothers in 2005, and founded the ethical water company Life Water.The company and its charity partner Drop 4 Drop "fund clear water projects across the globe"."I was originally an investment banker at Lehman Brothers and I was doing well and earning a lot of money, but I got sick of that greedy and corrupted world," he told Management Today in 2012.
BTS become first Korean artists to top UK chart:::::Image copyright Official Charts Company South Korean boyband BTS have landed their first ever UK number one album with the philosophy-inspired Map of the Soul: Persona.It means the seven-member group is now the first Korean act to score a chart-topping album in the UK.The band is playing two sold out shows at London's Wembley Stadium in June.In the singles chart, Lil Nas X claimed the top slot with Old Town Road thanks to 9.9 million streams, according to the Official Chart Company.The country-inspired novelty rap track - which was erased from the US country music chart in March - recently won support from country singer Billy Ray Cyrus who told the rapper "only outlaws are outlawed" and advised the 19-year-old to "take this as a compliment".Lil Nas X brings to an end Scots singer-songwriter Lewis Capaldi's seven-week run at number one with his song Someone You Loved."I cannot believe how amazing my song is doing on the UK charts," said Atlantan Lil Nas X, whose real name is Montero Lamar Hill."I'm still blown away by all the support for the track - thank you for listening!"The late Swedish DJ Avicii claimed his first posthumous hit with SOS ft. Aloe Blacc, which was the week's highest new entry at number 12.The producer, whose name is Tim Bergling, was found dead a year ago on 20 April.Back in the album chart, Billie Eilish's When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?dropped to number two after a two-week stint at the top of the chart while Chemical Brothers' ninth studio album No Geography debuted at number four.BTS's chart-topping album was inspired by Swiss psychologist Karl Jung's theories of ego, persona and the psyche.
Lil Dicky's all-star environmental music video goes viral:::::Image copyright Lil Dicky Image caption The video features cameos from 30 celebrity musicians An all-star animated environmental music video featuring the voices of Justin Bieber, Ed Sheeran and Ariana Grande has gone viral on social media.The song Earth, by comedian and rapper Lil Dicky, also has cameos from Katy Perry, Snoop Dogg and Miley Cyrus.Speaking to Time, Dicky - aka David Burd - said: "What started as a silly joke of an idea along the way became the most important thing I'll ever do."A share of proceeds will go to the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation.DiCaprio, who campaigns on environmental issues, also makes an animated appearance towards the end of the seven-minute long video.In Earth has had more than 2.5 million views on YouTube since going live early on Friday.Burd and his celebrity friends including Halsey, Snoop Dogg and Rita Ora urge people to fight against climate change.Hey, I'm a zebra / No one knows what I do, but I look pretty cool / Am I white or black?sings Ariana while Ed Sheeran, voicing an animated marsupial, adds: I'm a koala and I sleep all the time / So what?It's cute / How did you wrangle all of these superstars to be on the song?Image copyright Tim Mosenfelder Image caption Burd is a musician and comedian "It was me, my manager Scooter Braun [who also represents Bieber and Grande] and Benny Blanco, who is a true producer in every sense of the world," said Burd."We're all such competitive people that we all kept tabs on who got who."We all had our own relationships, and together, in a three-pronged attack, we got 30 artists.Burd admits he did have an issue trying to land one famous voice, belonging to mercurial rapper and producer Kanye West.Image copyright Kevin Geoghegan Image caption A share of proceeds will go to Leonardo DiCaprio's environmental charity "I'm friendly with Kanye - I used to play basketball with him," he said."But I left myself like three days to get Kanye on the phone and couldn't get in touch with him.He was pretty unreachable; he changed his email and his cell phone."So I reached out to Kevin Hart and asked, "Would you play Kanye?"and he said 'yes'."
David Attenborough climate change TV show a 'call to arms':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate Change - The Facts is available to watch on BBC iPlayer Sir David Attenborough's new BBC documentary on climate change has been praised by TV critics.Climate Change - The Facts, shown on BBC One on Thursday, was a "rousing call to arms", said the Guardian.In a four-star review, the Times said the veteran presenter "took a sterner tone... as though his patience was nearly spent".Sir David, 92, has called global warming "our greatest threat in thousands of years".In its review, The Arts Desk said: "Devastating footage of last year's climactic upheavals makes surreal viewing."While Earth has survived radical climactic changes and regenerated following mass extinctions, it's not the destruction of Earth that we are facing, it's the destruction of our familiar, natural world and our uniquely rich human culture."In the 20 years since I first started talking about the impact of climate change on our world, conditions have changed far faster than I ever imagined," Sir David said in the film.Image copyright AFP Image caption Climate change protesters have closed off central London since Monday "It may sound frightening, but the scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies."In a glowing review, the Telegraph called the title of the documentary "robust" and praised the use of Sir David in the central role."At a time when public debate seems to be getting ever more hysterical," it said, "it's good to be presented with something you can trust.And we all trust Attenborough.""Sir David Attenborough might as well be narrating a horror film," wrote the FT. "A panoply of profs line up to explain that the science on climate change is now unequivocal, never mind the brief clip of Donald Trump prating: 'It's a hoax, it's a hoax, OK'."But it added: "Fortunately for our nerves the last 20 minutes focuses on what needs to be - and can be - done on an international and personal level."Sir David's concern over the impacts of climate change has become a major focus for the naturalist in recent years and has been a theme of his Our Planet series on Netflix.The new BBC programme has a strong emphasis on hope with Sir David arguing that if dramatic action is taken over the next decade, then the world can keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5C this century, limiting the scale of the damage.The programme - which is now available on the BBC iPlayer - was broadcast as Extinction Rebellion protesters continues to cause disruption in parts of central London.
Jung lovers: BTS delve into psychology on their album, Map Of The Soul:::::Image caption BTS's album, Map Of The Soul: Persona, is heading for number one on both sides of the Atlantic Almost 30 years ago, in a classroom in the Jung Institute of Evanston, Illinois, Dr Murray Stein delivered a series of lectures that have had an unexpected impact on pop history.The topic was Carl Jung, the founding father of analytic psychology, who proposed and developed the concepts of extravert and introvert personalities, and the power of the unconscious.Dr Stein had condensed Jung's theories, originally scattered across 18 volumes of his collected works, into an accessible primer for students and trainee psychoanalysts.His course became a book - Jung's Map Of The Soul - which is now recognised as one of the best introductions to the concepts of analytical psychology, reprinted 15 times in English, and translated into dozens of languages.Much to Dr Stein's surprise, it is also the basis of the latest album by South Korean pop phenomena BTS - set to go to number one on both sides of the Atlantic this week."A couple of months ago, a Japanese student told me he'd discovered that the BTS website was recommending my book," he tells the BBC from International School of Analytical Psychology in Zurich."I said, 'What is BTS?'and he told me, so I looked them up online, read a little bit about them and left it at that."Then about a month ago, the same student told me they were coming out with a new album titled Map Of The Soul: Persona."I was floored."Image caption BTS sell a Korean translation of Dr Stein's book on their official website It's not just the album title, though: BTS's lyrics delve into Jungian concepts of the psyche, ego and collective unconscious - with a particular focus on the idea of Persona."Persona is a reference to the theatre," explains Dr Stein."It's the Latin word for the masks that actors wore on the stage - and we all put on masks, in a sense, when we go out into public."It's part of being a social animal: Our need to get along with other people, our need to be polite, our need to be part of a group."In some cultures this is more important than others, and I must say in the Asian cultures of Korea and Japan, where BTS originate, persona is an extremely important part of their lives."How you present yourself, how you address other people, how you locate yourself in the social world - as a younger brother, or a student, or a professor - all of this is really very prominent in their consciousness and their functioning as people in their society."BTS plunge straight into this concept on Map of the Soul's opening track."'Who am I?'is the question I've had all my life / And I'll probably never find the answer," raps Kim Nam-joon, discussing how praise for his on-stage persona stops him addressing his flaws and getting to know his true self.In the video, Kim confronts a giant version of himself, illustrating how his persona has overshadowed his ego; and performs in a room filled with mirrors, each reflecting a suppressed aspect of his personality.Dr Stein recognises the band's struggle to balance their public and private life as "the persona trap" - a condition that can trigger serious psychological problems."It's a very important topic because young people who find their personas inadequate, or feel like they're not fitting in, are very vulnerable to mobbing (bullying) or to suicidal acts - so I think BTS addressing that is very timely and important for their audience."The band continue to grapple with these ideas of identity throughout Map of the Soul: Persona.Mikrokosmos talks about deriving self-worth from within; while Jamais Vu looks at our tendency to repeat the same mistakes over and over again.Dr Stein explores the lyrics in-depth in a recent episode of the Speaking Of Jung podcast, where he explains how Map of the Soul is an album full of "longing and struggling for authenticity" that resolves on the final track, Dionysus, with the band "breaking out of persona traps" and reaching an awakening.'Very noisy' It's an unusual area for a pop record to explore - but K-pop artists often adopt "very unique and specific" perspectives, says Billboard columnist Jeff Benjamin."I've seen K-pop concepts that have ranged from Greek mythology to exotic animals to religious characters to Nick Cannon movies, but I don't think I can recall a popular K-pop act discussing themes of psychology and philosophy in their lyrics."And if they did, it wasn't a band at a level anywhere near BTS or they weren't as explicit as the group is on Map of the Soul.""BTS are quite unusual," agrees Dr Haekyung Um, a senior lecturer and specialist in Asian music at the University of Liverpool, "but if they weren't a K-pop band, I don't think this would be such a big issue."The way that K-pop is perceived, especially in the West, is to put it in a little box where everything is manufactured and artificial and the artists do not have their own voice."But if someone like Joni Mitchell had lyrics about the map of the soul, I don't think it would make a really big headline."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The band will become the first K-pop act to play Wembley Stadium later this year Dr Um, who grew up in South Korea, adds that self-examination has long been a feature of Korean folk music, through artists like Chung Taechun and Kim Kwangseok, and that philosophy is a mainstream concern in the country."Knowledge is a very important asset, and Koreans enjoy reading quite heavy philosophical texts," she says."Knowing and understanding something profound is seen to be really important.It will increase your self-confidence and value, and you become a more enlightened person."So when you go to the best-sellers display in Waterstones here in the UK, you wouldn't find books on philosophy - but you would in Korea."She also highlights the benign influence of BTS's record label boss Bang Si-hyuk, who studied philosophy before becoming a songwriter, on the band's output."I don't think he's the one who told BTS what to do, but he's very talented and very intelligent and this is a very clever business tactic, to sell all these books together with the music; and if it helps the audience to appreciate and enjoy the literary side, why not?"For Dr Stein, the release of Map of the Soul has given him a crash-course in K-pop and modern fandom.For the last three weeks, he's been busy replying to questions from the BTS Army about the band's lyrics and his own books (which have soared up the charts)."It's kind of taken over my life," he laughs."I'm 75 years old.I don't know very much about pop music, except it sounds very noisy."Nonetheless, he's emerged impressed with BTS's understanding of psychological health."I've been told death and aggression are big themes in music - you know, rappers doing their thing in a very assertive way - so this seems a very wholesome and positive direction for a pop band of their magnitude."They have millions of followers and for them to be putting out this kind of message is very encouraging, in this world where we're constantly struggling."And Jeff Benjamin says BTS's exploration of Jungian psychology isn't likely to end with this record."BTS have a history of releasing albums in trilogies, and they said Map of the Soul: Persona would kick-start a new chapter in their career, so I definitely feel like we're going to see at least one more Map of the Soul album."If 'Persona' was the first aspect of Jungian theory they explored, maybe we'll get Map of the Soul: Shadow, which I'd expect would explore the darker sides of the BTS members' psyches."Actually, that would be a truly fascinating side to explore and something else we have not seen from the K-pop scene either."Dr Stein agrees: "I think this album is laying the groundwork for further developments."We'll have to see what they come up with next."Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

Sophie Gradon: Love Island star took own life:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Sophie Gradon was crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009 A former beauty queen and Love Island star took cocaine and alcohol and then killed herself, an inquest has found.Star of the ITV2 dating show Sophie Gradon hanged herself at her family home in Medburn, Ponteland on 20 June.The 32-year-old was found by her boyfriend Aaron Armstrong, 25, who took his own life 20 days later.Northumberland South coroner Eric Armstrong said he was "certain she would not have acted as she did without taking alcohol and cocaine".Mr Armstrong told North Shields Coroner's Court research in the USA suggested someone was 16 times more likely to take their life if they consumed both."The combination is used by those who believe it brings on a so-called high much quicker," he said."What they do not appreciate is it also gives rise to violent thoughts."If Sophie's death is to serve any purpose at all, that message must go out far and wide."Home Office pathologist Dr Jennifer Bolton said Ms Gradon was two-and-a-half times the drink-drive limit and under the influence of cocaine.Det Sgt Neill Jobling of Northumbria Police told the hearing Ms Gradon had been exchanging messages with a male friend into the early hours of the day she died.In them she said she had had suicidal thoughts, that she was "struggling with the world" and every day with ADHD, and she "cannot do this any more".In another message sent at 01:44 BST she said: "I would never want to do that to my family but if I could escape I would."She had alcohol and cocaine in her system which increased the likelihood of violent thoughts and actions, Det Sgt Jobling said.Image copyright Instagram Image caption Aaron Armstrong died 20 days after his girlfriend Sophie Gradon Ms Gradon, who had more than 400,000 followers on Instagram, was crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009 and appeared on Love Island in 2016.She had been diagnosed with depression and low self-esteem in 2013 and was taking medication for social anxiety disorder at the time of her death, Det Sgt Jobling said.The inquest heard she was found hanging in the living room of her parents' home by Mr Armstrong and his brother.Mr Armstrong attempted CPR for 15 minutes but quickly realised she was dead.He had become concerned after not receiving any messages from his girlfriend during the day.The pair had been exchanging messages until after 02:00 but when he woke up after 11:00 he got no reply from messages or phone calls.Mr Armstrong had been in a relationship with the former beauty queen since May 2018 after meeting her on a night out in Newcastle.He killed himself days after her death, a coroner at his inquest found.The coroner said Mr Armstrong's thinking could have been "muddled" by her death.For support and more information on emotional distress, click here.

Ukraine election: Comedian Zelensky wins presidency by landslide:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Volodymyr Zelensky and his supporters celebrate winning Ukraine's presidential election Ukrainian comedian Volodymyr Zelensky has scored a landslide victory in the country's presidential election.With nearly all ballots counted in the run-off vote, Mr Zelensky had taken more than 73% with incumbent Petro Poroshenko trailing far behind on 24%."I will never let you down," Mr Zelensky told celebrating supporters.Russia says it wants him to show "sound judgement", "honesty" and "pragmatism" so that relations can improve.Russia backs separatists in eastern Ukraine.The comments came from Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, in a Facebook post on Monday (in Russian).He said he expected Mr Zelensky to "repeat familiar ideological formulas" that he used in the election campaign, adding: "I have no illusions on that score."At the same time, there is a chance to improve relations with our country."Mr Poroshenko, who admitted defeat after the first exit polls were published, has said he will not be leaving politics.He told voters that Mr Zelensky, 41, was too inexperienced to stand up to Russia effectively.Mr Zelensky, a political novice, is best known for starring in a satirical television series Servant of the People, in which his character

News, Kiev Ukrainians are waking up this morning and discovering that the last few months were not a dream.They really have elected a man who currently stars in a TV series as the president - as the country's next real president.And it wasn't even close.The pressure will now be on Mr Zelensky to demonstrate that he knows what he is doing.Throughout the election campaign, he avoided serious interviews and discussions about policy - preferring instead to post light-hearted videos to social media.He's got about a month before the inauguration.Then the comedian-turned-president will be faced with a complex in-tray that includes a simmering war with Russian-backed rebels in the east.Mr Poroshenko, who has been in power since 2014, said the result of the election "leaves us with

decisive day for Ukraine.Free elections and peaceful change of power = strong Ukrainian democracy.Congratulations to Volodymyr Zelensky.The EU is determined to continue its support.Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) April 21, 2019 Report Who is Volodymyr Zelensky?Mr Zelensky starred in the long-running satirical drama Servant of the People in which his character accidentally becomes Ukraine's president.He plays a teacher who is elected after his expletive-laden rant about corruption goes viral on social media.He ran under a political party with the same name as his show.With no previous political experience, Mr Zelensky's campaign focused on his difference to the other candidates rather than on any concrete policy ideas.Despite this, he won the first round with more than 30% of the vote - almost double what Mr Poroshenko got when he finished in second place with 15.95%.What do voters think of him?Analysts believe Mr Zelensky's informal style and vow to clean up Ukrainian politics resonated with voters who are disillusioned with the country's path under Mr Poroshenko.Eschewing traditional campaign tactics, Mr Zelensky channelled his on-screen persona by promising to stamp out corruption and loosen the grip of oligarchs on Ukraine.Experts say his supporters, frustrated with establishment politicians and cronyism, have been energised by his charisma and anti-corruption message.His critics, meanwhile, are sceptical about his credentials, with many expressing concern over his close links to the billionaire oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky.They have expressed doubts that he will be able to take on the country's influential oligarchs and stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Chloë Grace Moretz: 'No age limit' for learning acceptance:::::Image copyright Universal Image caption Moretz as the warm-hearted yet naive Frances in Greta US actress Chlo Grace Moretz knows a thing or two about LGBT education.Growing up in the conservative Christian town of Rome, Georgia, two of her brothers felt they had to "pray the gay away" before coming out.That led to her taking a role in last year's Miseducation of Cameron Post, where she played a character who was sent to a gay conversion therapy centre.Now, with stories about equality teaching hitting the headlines, Moretz tells the BBC that there should be "no age limit" for learning about these issues.Speaking from Los Angeles ahead of the release of her new psychological thriller, Greta, the star says: "I think children know what you teach them."I had two gay brothers in my family, and our little cousins have known my brothers as gay from the time they were little bitty babies."They grew up understanding that was a part of life and that love comes in many forms.So I feel like there shouldn't be an age limit to that - I think it's unfair to the child."She adds: "It's just like saying 'I'm not gonna give my kid the full colouring box because right now they should only draw with black and white' - we don't work that way."Why not give them the full range of the spectrum to grow into themselves and understand that they have the world in the palm of their hand."Image copyright Universal Image caption Moretz on the "incredible" Isabelle Huppert as Greta (left): "She's so cool, she's so incredibly terrifying at the same time as being so elegant, and stunning - it's a crazy mix that only she could do."Although she's only 22, Moretz has one of the most varied CVs in cinema - with a filmography that includes horror (Suspiria, Let Me In), action (Kick-Ass), comedy (Big Momma's House 2, 500 Days of Summer) and heartwarming kids' fare (Hugo, Muppets Most Wanted).For her latest role, the actress plays Frances McCullen; a young out-of-town waitress who's trying to make it on her own in the big bad city.Twisted fairytale The girl, who has recently lost her mother, befriends an apparently dear old lady, Greta Hideg - played by the "incredible" Isabelle Huppert - after finding her handbag on the subway.But it quickly transpires the bag was left there deliberately - and Frances is fated to become the latest in a long line of girls that Greta hopes will replace her own missing daughter."It's a twisted fairytale in a lot of ways and a lot of fun to jump into," says Moretz."What I found interesting when I first read the script was this psychological insight: Is a monster born or is a monster bred?"It's a movie about grief and loss and isolation in a lot of ways and what that does with people's minds."Would Moretz return the bag herself though, if the situation happened for real?"At this point I can safely say I'll never be a good Samaritan ever again," she jokes, "I'm never gonna help anyone!"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption I'd put that bag down if I were you...The former child star admits she's "always been interested in the dark or the occult," from the time she did her first movie, 2005's The Amityville Horror."I've always had this kind of underlying darker tone in my career," she explains."I think it's just I've always been interested in the abnormal psychology of that and to portray that on film I think is really interesting and so multi-faceted and you can really dive deep and pick it apart and kind of wear this unnatural skin for yourself."As an actor, for me, I think it really broadens my emotional-scape."The more frightening moments of her latest film involved a maniacal confrontation in a restaurant (she actually worked in a Dublin restaurant to prepare), a bloody scene involving kitchen utensils and - most terrifying of all - being locked in a cupboard."That was definitely the worst moment for me," she says."I've jumped out of aeroplanes and I'm completely fine with fear most of the time, but my one thing is claustrophobia and it's just completely debilitating."We tried to keep it as succinct as possible and the least amount of takes as we could possibly do but sometimes, how it goes, you don't always have that option."But [director] Neil [Jordan] was really wonderful with me, and really took his time with me to make sure that I felt as comfortable as possible... while having a panic attack!"Male lens With 15 years' on-screen experience, Moretz has witnessed the darker side of the film industry too - and recently pulled her support from the animated film Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs, to which she lent her voice, after a promotional poster appeared to body-shame Snow White.While the actress says she's "seen change in the industry", she believes there's still a long way to go in the fight for gender equality."Representation is still few and far between," she says, "because, at the end of the day, most of the time we're still being directed, written, seen and shot through a male lens."They can cast a female lead but that doesn't mean it's a female-driven story, as you still need people behind the scenes to be of a different mind-state because that's how you see progress."It's not just the poster child - 'oh we have a female lead' - it's about what's actually happening in the inner workings and what the product is gonna be.Image copyright Universal Image caption Maika Monroe as Erica Penn, Frances' roommate and rightly-concerned friend "The most I can do as an actor is show up and do my job but there's a hundred other people who take what I do, edit it and shape it into what their vision is."So it's one step in the right direction for sure but we have a lot more ground to break."The next stop on Moretz's own personal mission to out-spook all of her peers is providing the voice of the "iconic" Wednesday Addams in the new Addams Family animation.Recording her role was "a total blast" but with a similarly "ominous umbrella hanging over it"."I don't know what that says about my personality," she laughs - "or my psyche!"Greta is in cinemas from Thursday Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

Viewpoint: Beyonce’s Homecoming celebrates black culture and education:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Beyonce's new documentary features quotes and audio from black leaders and intellectuals Beyonc's Netflix documentary Homecoming is much more than a film about the first black woman to headline the Coachella music festival.It is a celebration of black American culture with education, specifically Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), serving as the foundation of her message.In the film, Beyonc describes how she always wanted to attend an HBCU, but Destiny's Child and the trials and tribulations of celebrity instead became her higher education."She did not attend an HBCU, but she has learned from and mimicked the culture that's present at HBCUs," said Dawn Williams, the Dean of Howard University's School of Education."[Beyonc's] naming the film Homecoming is quite illustrative of what it feels like.I saw examples of what we experience here at homecoming.Homecoming is not just for alumni, or returning students.It is a community event.You'll find a multitude of many different kinds of people there."Regardless of whether you are a celebrated artist like Beyonc, or a fan who watched Homecoming on Netflix, you can attend an HBCU homecoming and likewise have the opportunity to receive an education from some of the African diaspora's greatest minds.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Beyonce was the first black woman to headline Coachella music festival Throughout Homecoming, Beyonc included quotes and audio from black leaders and intellectuals, and I greatly appreciated the quote she used from W.E.B.Du Bois: "Education must not simply teach work - it must teach life."This quote was radical and empowering over 100 years ago, and for better or worse it still leaves a lasting impact today.The quote is from Du Bois' "Talented Tenth" essay in 1903 that both articulated his vision of higher education for black people, and served as a stern rebuke to his rival Booker T Washington who advocated for blacks to prioritise industrial and agrarian training.In the late 19th Century, Washington was the most popular black man in America, and was the first black man formally invited to the White House for dinner.Washington's fame largely grew from his Atlanta Compromise speech in 1895 that urged black people to leave higher education to the white man, and instead focus on manual labour and learning a trade.Du Bois' ideas prevailed, and it is troubling to imagine how bleak and oppressive American society might be today if Washington had won this debate.Du Bois' ideas soon thereafter gave birth to the Niagara Movement in 1905, which became the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.Without the NAACP, and other organisations and individuals that espoused Du Bois' vision, there might not have been a civil rights movement in the 1960s, and who knows when Jim Crow might have ended.Beyonc also plays audio of Malcolm X passionately describing the unenviable plight of black women in America.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Quotes from Malcolm X, pictured here speaking at a rally, are featured in the new documentary "The most disrespected person in America is the black woman.The most unprotected woman in America is the black woman.The most neglected woman in America is the black woman."As a black man in America, I grew up learning about Du Bois, Malcolm X, and countless other black male leaders, so their inclusion reminded me of my childhood.Du Bois was the intellectual, and Malcolm was the defender; and as men, if we aspire to use our intellect and strength to combat racism we cannot overlook the necessity of dismantling patriarchal oppression with equal vigour.Working to elevate female voices and ensure that young girls have an abundance of female role models remains an essential feature of black empowerment, and I appreciated the diversity of female voices that Beyonc used.Beyonc's selection of writer, activist, feminist Audre Lorde's quote "Without community, there is no liberation," is an astute and provocative choice because it tackles both racial and gender oppression.At first glance, the quote speaks to the strength and resilience of America's black community and our constant struggle to liberate ourselves from the oppression of systemic racism in America; but it also speaks to the importance of inclusion, diversity, and representation.This quote came from Lorde's speech "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House", which Lorde gave at an international conference celebrating Simone de Beauvoir's The Second Sex, and she used her platform to denounce the conference's and the feminist movement's lack of diversity and marginalisation of women of colour."You can't be what you can't see," said Marian Wright Edelman, a 1959 graduate of Spelman College, and the founder of the Children's Rights Fund who was also quoted in the film.Beyonc bookends her film with quotes from authors Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou, and their wisdom has always gracefully empowered our community, celebrated our humanity, and provided a richness to our struggle for equality that the world needs to hear.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Maya Angelou was described by Barack Obama as "one of the brightest lights of our time" "What I really want to do is be a representative of my race, of the human race.I have a chance to show how kind we can be.How intelligent and generous we can be," said Angelou.The significance of Homecoming also is not merely about the celebrated African Americans featured in the film, or the behind the scenes look at how Beyonc prepared for the concert; but is also about the foundational importance education has always held in the black community.Prior to the Civil War it was illegal to educate black people in most parts of the South, but following the Emancipation Proclamation and during Reconstruction, black families spent nearly half of their income on education.The American government did not actively fund these institutions to black education, so newly-freed African Americans pooled their money together to build schools.They worked with affluent white allies to build gleaming, new beacons of higher learning; and many HBCUs still bear the name of the white man who had the money to build it.Educating African Americans has never been a priority in American society, but it has always been the foundation of black culture in America.Homecoming displayed the beauty of black culture, and gave people the chance to celebrate the necessity of black education.Barrett is a writer, journalist and filmmaker focusing on race, culture and politics
Author Sharna Jackson: Bringing diversity into children's books:::::Image copyright Knights Of/Joshua Fray Image caption Sharna Jackson's debut novel stars sisters Norva and Nik Author Sharna Jackson is something of a rarity.As a black children's writer, she's already in a minority.But her debut book High-Rise Mystery, a detective story starring young black sisters and featuring a diverse cast, puts Jackson in an extra select league."When I was young, I kept on reading and watching but the representation wasn't there," Jackson tells BBC News."It was hard to find role models outside popular culture."When I read, the default in my head was 'white'.Unless the character was black, it wouldn't be stated."According to the recent report BookTrust Represents, covering 2007-2017, just 5.6% of published UK children's authors and illustrators are from a black and minority ethnic (BAME) background.And in 2018, figures from the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education (CLPE) showed that of the 9,115 children's books published over the previous 12 months, 4% featured BAME characters.Only 1% had a character of colour as lead.In many cases, the stories were about social justice issues or conflict rather than mystery, magic or fun.Image copyright CLPE Farrah Serroukh, director of the CLPE study, says lack of representation is a "cross-sector systemic issue".But, she adds, "it is fundamental for a child's personal development that they see themselves reflected in the pages of the books they read and have the opportunity to experience realities beyond their own... such self-affirming experiences are invaluable in nurturing a child's reader identity".Jackson confirms she struggled in her formative years to find anyone to associate with on the page.Now the problem is being repeated with her nine-year-old son, she says.Image copyright CLPE And, she says, the quality of the representation is vital too."All children need to see themselves and others reflected in culture - representation leads to empathy.That visibility is extremely important, but so is moving away from stereotypes and one-note, 'prop' characters."I don't just want to read about black children in 'issue-based' narratives.Why can't black children exist in 'white' genres?Why can't they see themselves being clever, creative and having fun?"Why 'seeing yourself' matters Lack of representation can lead BAME children to become dispirited by reading and quashes ambitions to enter publishing, so extending the problem into the adult market.Image copyright Wall To Wall Image caption Former Children's Laureate Malorie Blackman is best known for the series Noughts and Crosses This was recently highlighted in a campaign to encourage more women BAME crime writers, backed by JK Rowling and other big names.Jill Coleman of BookTrust says: "The world that children's books represents has a huge impact on how young readers see themselves and the world around them and on their aspirations for the future."Former Children's Laureate Malorie Blackman said in 2014: "A very significant message goes out when you cannot see yourself at all in the books you are reading... it is saying 'well, you may be here, but do you really belong?'"Jackson says she'd always harboured a desire to be an author but concentrated on her career as a curator engaging children in the arts.She loved old-fashioned detective stories, such as Poirot and Sherlock, as well as the concept of mash-up genres.Her idea was to combine the two in a children's novel, one that embraced diversity, felt relevant and empowered its readers."I thought it'd be really interesting to take a traditional murder mystery and set it in a council estate and see what happened," says Jackson."I also thought it's important to be writing stories where young diverse people can see themselves and doing interesting things."Keeping it 'realistic and engaging' When Knights Of, an inclusive children's publisher, was founded by Aimee Felone and David Stevens in 2017, Jackson "reached out to David on Twitter and he said, 'why don't you consider writing a book?'".High-Rise Mystery stars black sleuthing sisters Norva, 13, and Nik, 11, living on a London council estate.Their latest, and biggest, case is uncovering who killed Hugo, the much-liked art teacher and antiques dealer.Image copyright Paul Clarke Image caption Farrah Serroukh says the encouragement to increase BAME representation in publishing has to be ongoing They are super smart and eagle-eyed.And their skilled use of technology, analytics and gut instinct keeps them one step ahead.Nik and Norva are also chalk and cheese."They are both like me but different parts of my personality," explains Jackson."I went through a phase where I loved shaving my head because it was really practical and that's like Nik.She's very straightforward and 'bish, bash, bosh,' gets things done."Norva is more flighty and dramatic and that can also be me."The story has an eclectic cast of varied age, background and foibles."I wanted to make them feel engaging and like people you want to spend time with even if they were doing bad things," says Jackson.Image copyright BookTrust Image caption BookTrust's Jill Coleman says they aim to increase the number of BAME authors and illustrators from 5% to 10% by 2022 But their ethnicities are only implied."My thinking was that if a character is black it doesn't occur to them that they are.That is just the default," says Jackson.Give the story wide appeal Jackson grew up in Luton, which she describes as a "much maligned town that has a lot to celebrate" and didn't want to perpetuate the similar negative stereotype suffered by housing estates."I worried for a second but the fact is there are black people on estates and instead of shying away from it, let's try to tell some interesting stories," she says."Estates get a bad press but there are people living there having good lives and doing great things."I was friends with children who lived on estates and I was always struck by the sense of community and everybody mucking in.It felt really special."And she hopes her story will appeal regardless of background."It will give a window onto a world that's completely different.It may not be not directly relevant to their lives, but neither is going into space."Jackson's son Joseph kept the story grounded.They transformed their home into a makeshift police investigation room, with Post-it notes over the walls and up the stairs."He was especially brilliant at collecting quotes and thinking of possible murder methods and weapons, which was a bit worrying!"says Jackson.Image copyright Bookseller Image caption David Stevens and Aimee Felone of publisher Knights Of foster diversity in their authors and workforce "But his input helped keep the writing in touch with who was writing it for.Input from kids is a vital part of writing or creating anything for children - it makes the end product better."Debunking publishing For the push for more BAME children's stories and authors to be more than a trend, the encouragement has to be ongoing, says Farrah Serroukh.She also says under-representation is not limited to the UK, illustrated in the US by the University of Winsconsin-Madison's research.Initiatives in publishing and in schools are up and running or in the pipeline, galvanised by the CLPE report, she says.The report will now be issued annually.Knights Of is an independent publisher aiming to foster diversity in their authors and workforce by demystifying the industry."Publishing is so secretive.And you have to know the right people to get ahead.There's a lack of knowledge within certain communities of the routes into publishing," says Aimee Felone."And then there's not seeing themselves in bookshops.Before you can even consider being a published author you have to see yourself as one."That's not to say that people should only be able to write the background that they're from, but we need to address the fact that there aren't enough authors from Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds."Then we can see about exclusion across the board."

Stormzy was 'right' to cancel Snowbombing gig say Big Joanie:::::Image copyright Ellie Smith They are a world away from UK grime - musically speaking - but self-proclaimed 'black feminist sistah punk' band Big Joanie are standing with Stormzy.That's after the grime star cancelled a festival headline appearance in Austria late on last week, claiming members of his team had been racially profiled.In an Instagram story, the rapper claimed his friends were targeted by security at the Snowbombing event, who were acting on reports of a weapon.Organisers responded by saying staff had acted in accordance to protocol.Speaking after their own Record Store Day gig at Rough Trade east, the London-based punk three-piece have nothing but respect for the Glastonbury headliner's decision to walk away."I think Stormzy made the right decision - a brave decision," stand-up drummer Chardine Taylor-Stone tells the BBC."He could easily have sat quietly and done nothing but he's in a position of power in the industry now to actually make a positive change."She adds: "As people in bands there is an element of privilege being backstage and people don't tend to search you; no-one is searching Led Zeppelin!"They [the festival] seem to think because they're black men playing a certain kind of music that they must be involved, which is absurd."You hear backstage stories of drugs and throwing televisions out the windows and Motley Crue's mad lifestyle... Would they have been searched?Unlikely."His people were just minding their own business and working."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Stormzy: Doing his job Big Joanie, #72 in our list of Newbie Tuesday artists, consists of Chardine, bass player Estella Adeyeri and singer/guitarist Stephanie Phillips and they released their debut album, Sistahs, in November on Sonic Youth's Thurston Moore's new imprint.The band met on Facebook and made their live debut soon after at First Timers Festival; a workshop encouraging people from marginalised communities to come together and form bands.Phillips suggests that, as an all-black female rock band they've suffered similar treatment to Stormzy's team, while touring their new record in support of Parquet Courts."We always get searched at airports," says the singer, with a dismissive laugh."There's that thing when we are touring Europe, people staring at us loads and being taken aback by our presence, that was uncomfortable for me."Because we have a black tour driver as well, we just stood out and I don't think they could figure out what we were doing round there.""We've also had a weird experience at a Bristol Festival," she adds, "where everyone was doing weird cultural appropriation but didn't seem to notice - white dreads everywhere!"Just as I was about to go on stage there was a white girl with a T-shirt that said 'I will never be a slave,' and I was like 'you can't wear that in front of me while I'm playing... take it off - that's not your history.'"She was so scared, she was shaking.But that was just general ignorance and disrespect; just not connecting with who we are as a band or realising there might be some backlash if you're gonna be that stupid."We let people know that you can't really get away with that kind of thing."'If anyone needs punk right now it's black people' The frontwoman credits bands like The Breeders and Throwing Muses; as well as 60s girl groups such as The Ronettes, The Crystals and The Supremes as big musical influences however admits that, deep down, she "always wanted to have a black punk band."Their mission is to set about re-writing certain chapters of rock 'n' roll history which, they believe, have been retrospectively whitewashed."We know our history and play music outside of what is traditionally known as black," Phillips explains."If you look back there's always been black people who have been making things happen and have been at the centre of the scene, playing what we now know as rock 'n' roll, back in the 40s."Poly Styrene [X-Ray Spex] was making all this radical music in the 70s, so there's always been people who have been integral to moving forward but history is always written by the same person; the same white, middle-class straight men basically who only see their own people and assume that everyone else is just there for fun."Talking about rebellion and fighting against what's wrong.If anyone needs punk right now it's black people."Phillips' band will perform at this year's Great Escape festival in Brighton, following a successful appearance, alongside the likes of Sam Fender, at South By Southwest in Austin, Texas, for BBC Music Introducing.With their brilliantly-bolshy band manifesto, Big Joanie are not attempting to create an uber niche new subgenre of political rock.It simply serves, they say, as an "honest" and "literal" description of all three members.In other words; what you see is what you get."The idea with Big Joanie is we're not necessarily performing our black political identity, it's just always there," Phillips states, matter-of-factly."I think when people hear that we're a 'black feminist sistah punk' band they want us to be saying some sort of 'we hate the white man' type rhetoric."It's just not necessary as we don't really think about it on an everyday basis, we think about what we're going through, our emotions and ourselves."Sistahs is out now and Big Joanie have upcoming gigs in Manchester, London and Brighton Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
How social media is changing comedy:::::Image copyright Grace Bristo (Amelia)/Publicity handouts Image caption L-R: Amelia Dimoldenberg, Kojo Anim, Yomi Sontan Social media is now the go-to platform to showcase everything we do, and comedians have been quick to use it to promote their work.Whether it's with pranks, sketches or jokes, making your audience laugh is one of the easiest ways to go viral.But can traditional stand-up comedy survive in the new comedy climate?There are several pitfalls comedians can fall into, in the online era, as the BBC's comedy controller Shane Allen pointed out last week."For social media you can have three tweets will lead to a storm... there's people who are a lot more willing to take offence easily because they'll take material out of context," he told BBC News."People sometimes confuse the subject of a joke with the target of a joke.So anything around race or sex is accused of being racist or sexist, so a handful of comments and opinions can quickly become quite a storm and damaging so I would like the comedy community to be able to represent ourselves a bit more."Allen added he actively advises comedians to stay off Twitter once a TV show has been commissioned, to avoid the likelihood of being caught up in any scandals.'Great opportunity' But while there are plenty of potential pitfalls, there are also plenty of benefits to comedians being on Twitter.Many use it as their main platform to build a profile.Amelia Dimoldenberg, also known as "the girl from the chicken shop", set up a spoof dating show where she interviews grime artists and influencers in fried chicken shops across London.Through social media, she built up traction and meme accounts, such as YoungKingsTV, Warmzn and ImJustBait, helped by advertising short versions of her YouTube videos on their pages.But Amelia, who has over 160,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel, doesn't believe that traditional live stand-up comedy is obsolete just yet.She tells BBC News: "I think that the online world of comedy has just created a different way to consume it rather than replacing traditional set-ups."I do think that if you want to be hyper successful in today's landscape you must master them both."Amelia uses Mo Gilligan, also known as Mo The Comedian, as an example.Gilligan co-hosts Channel 4's The Big Narstie Show and tours regularly, but also has countless viral social media videos, and has sold out tours across the country with his a Coupla Cans comedy nights.He started out by uploading clips while still working in a clothes store in London (customers even began to recognise him).According to Amelia, digital platforms have birthed a new area for comedy to be displayed, which should be welcomed.Yomi Sontan, known online as Yoms TV, uses Instagram as his main platform to showcase his comedy.He has more than 130,000 followers and generally accumulates around 60,000 views per post.He believes the respect for traditional comedy, such as stand up in the UK, is declining.Speaking about TV comedy programmes, he said: "We see the same old shows like Mock The Week and Live at the Apollo."The way audiences watch comedy has evolved, there's no longer a set time on TV, they can watch it when they want through tablets and other devices."Comedian Kojo landed the coveted golden buzzer from Simon Cowell on Britain's Got Talent earlier this month.He's also travelled all around Europe and Africa with his stand-up comedy.He has also introduced London's first black comedy club, Da Comedy Fun House, which has been graced by the likes of US comedy heavyweights Dave Chapelle and Kevin Hart.According to Kojo, social media is a great way to build up a following, but he adds that stand-up comedians should be worried about the rise of the online comedian."Unlike music or a movie, you only laugh at the joke once and it gets lighter and lighter and lighter till it's not funny anymore," he explains.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dave Chapelle is among the stars who have performed at Da Comedy Fun House Kojo adds comedy audiences on social media and at live gigs are after very different things."It's all 90 seconds long online, whereas with live stand up there's a bit more story telling," he says."It's more slow place with a genuine interaction - it's very easy to re-shoot it for social media.But when it's live it either works or it doesn't."Aaron Brown, the owner and editor of the British Comedy Guide says social media "offers comedians a great opportunity for wide exposure"."It's a chance to find and grow a fan-base potentially very quickly, as well as for promotion and where fans can see them, whether that's a stand-up tour, an existing DVD release, a TV appearance, a podcast or any one of a number of other activities."He adds it offers fans a great opportunity to re-promote comics' material, with organic recommendations and benefits.New and upcoming comics can use social media as a tool to find work, as well as sharing stories and boosting their morale chatting with colleagues.There are certainly risks, as Allen argued last week, that given the immediacy of the platform, comedians find themselves at increased risk of being at the centre of a scandal.But while it's a tricky minefield for the industry, it's one from which huge rewards can be reaped if used carefully and wisely.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
Game of Thrones: The breakout stars of HBO's hit series:::::Image copyright HBO Image caption Kit Harington (playing Jon Snow, right, with Jon Bradley) has become one of the breakout stars After eight years, a lot of nudity and more deaths than an episode of Midsomer Murders, Game of Thrones is finally drawing to a close.The eighth and final season will consist of just six episodes, the first of which will be broadcast in the US on Sunday and a day later in the UK.The HBO series is regarded by critics as one of the greatest TV shows of all time and has inspired an almost religious following amongst its fans.But what might be next for its sizeable cast, many of whom were given their big break by the show?And will the stars be able to shake off their characters?"I think perhaps those actors who are less obviously associated with the roles have done best so far," the Guardian's Sarah Hughes tells BBC News, drawing particular attention to actors who were in the series for a relatively short period of time."Thus Richard Madden's role in Bodyguard has done wonders for his profile, Rose Leslie has the part in The Good Fight, Jason Momoa is building a reasonably respectable action career."Momoa may only have spent a couple of years on the show, but has since played Aquaman, which made more than $1bn ($760m) at the box office, and is now one of the most distinctive faces in Hollywood.She adds: "The likes of Jon Bradley and Hannah Murray [Gilly] will probably get parts on British TV even if not Hollywood."But Hollywood has already come calling for several of the show's biggest names.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Emilia Clarke portrays Daenerys Targaryen in the series Along with Momoa, Emilia Clarke is possibly one of the most obvious examples of a GoT star who has achieved big-screen success.She has landed leading roles in several major films since playing Daenerys Targaryen.Clarke acted opposite Sam Claflin in the 2016 film adaptation of JoJo Moyes's best-selling novel Me Before You, and last year portrayed Qi'ra in Solo: A Star Wars Story.But Hughes says Clarke is someone "who might well struggle" with other roles going forward."Hers is such an iconic role that its hard to break free from it, and so far her non-GoT choices haven't been that good."Shaking off your most famous role is something actors have long struggled with."It's really hard to be cast in [a dramatic film]," Friends actress Jennifer Aniston said in 2015.Especially if "you're someone who is battling a persona.Sometimes it's hard to disappear from it in a role."Image copyright Getty Images Similarly, Alfonso Ribeiro has found it difficult to break free from his portrayal of Carlton in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the 1990s."It has forced ME to be my character," he told Metro in 2017."I would like to try some stuff that is different from how the world sees me, just sink my teeth into shoot, I could be a deranged killer!"But I doubt someone would automatically think of me when they go, 'We need to cast a killer, let's get the dude who played Carlton'."Therefore, the Game of Thrones actors who were already well-known prior to the show may find it easier to shake off their characters."The established stars such as Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey will probably go back to solid careers," says Hughes."Even if they've played icon parts they're still just stops in longer careers and Headey's really raised her profile since GoT."Some of the younger cast members, like Sophie Turner and Maisie Williams, were less established as actresses when they were cast but are now highly likely to go on to further success.Both were in their early teens when they were first cast as Sansa and Arya Stark respectively, and now the show is drawing to a close they're getting the chance to branch out artistically.Turner, for example, will star alongside Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Fassbender in Dark Phoenix later this year.Williams, meanwhile, has been seen in Mary Shelley and appeared in a few episodes of Doctor Who in 2015.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner were in their early teens when cast in GoT But, she said in February, she's not even sure she wants to become the next major Hollywood star."Now that I'm 21, people have been saying to me when this show finishes, you're going to have your whole life and lots of opportunity," she told BBC News."I'm asking myself a lot of questions like, what do I want in my life?"Most of the films that I see in the cinema right now don't really interest me."And unfortunately the [film scripts] I read that I really love, they just don't get funded.People aren't funding indie movies in general."A look at some other cult TV shows can tell us a lot about the mixed fortunes the various cast members can receive.Take, for example, The Wire - another HBO show which is widely regarded as one of the greatest TV series of all time.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Idris Elba and Dominic West received a huge profile boost from The Wire After its launch in 2002, it was widely praised for the opportunities it provided its huge cast, many of whom were real-life Baltimore residents with no acting experience.But while it was a springboard for the likes of Idris Elba and Dominic West to go on to much bigger roles, many of The Wire's other stars have disappeared.Several Thrones stars have already taken advantage of the considerable profile boost they've received from being on the show.Kit Harington may be one of the most recognisable names among the cast thanks to his portrayal of Jon Snow.Since leaving the show, he has appeared in a West End production of Doctor Faustus, as well as films like Pompeii and Testament of Youth."He got very good reviews on stage recently which suggests that he might be capable of building a wider career which I wouldn't always have said," says Hughes."He might be a better actor than I thought.... he's definitely thinking carefully about what happens next."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Gwendoline Christie has also starred in Star Wars and Top of the Lake Gwendoline Christie's roles since joining Game of Thrones in 2012 have included a part in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and a major role in Top of the Lake alongside Elisabeth Moss."She's someone who you think might have been defined by her role but really isn't, possibly because she's so interesting as a person and has the modelling side career," says Hughes."Plus she really seems genuinely unconcerned by what might come next, and has the Star Wars franchise which helps."Hughes adds that some of the less well-known GoT actors could be worth keeping an eye on."I do wonder about someone like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau who I think is excellent on the show.I'd like to see him get some decent roles - he's got an interesting vulnerability under the wisecracks."Game of Thrones is broadcast in the UK on Sky Atlantic at 21:00 BST on Monday.Follow us on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, on Instagram at bbcnewsents, or email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.
