Crusader skeletons discovery sheds new light on the Crusades:::::A medieval burial pit in Lebanon is shedding new light on the Crusader era in the Middle East.The Crusades were a series of religious wars that began in the 11th century and lasted until the 13th century when the Christian crusaders were forced out of their last strongholds in what is now Israel and Lebanon.Scientists studied the DNA of nine Crusaders buried in a 13th-century burial pit near a crusader castle close to the Lebanese city of Sidon.The study, which is published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, found that the Crusaders were genetically diverse and that they had children with the local population.LAST SUPPER SITE REVEALS ITS SECRETS IN STUNNING 3D LASER SCANS Three of the crusaders were European, four were Near Easterners and two had mixed ancestry, according to the researchers."Our findings give us an unprecedented view of the ancestry of the people who fought in the Crusader army.And it wasn't just Europeans," said the studys first authorMarc Haber of the U.K.s Wellcome Sanger Institute, in a statement."We see this exceptional genetic diversity in the Near East during medieval times, with Europeans, Near Easterners, and mixed individuals fighting in the Crusades and living and dying side by side.""We know that Richard the Lionheart went to fight in the Crusades, but we don't know much about the ordinary soldiers who lived and died there, and these ancient samples give us insights into that," said Chris Tyler-Smith, a genetics researcher at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the studys senior author.AMAZING CRUSADER DISCOVERY: GOTHIC HALL FOUND AT KNIGHTS' HILLTOP CASTLE However, traces of Crusader DNA are insignificant among modern Lebanese people.The researchers noted that other mass migrations, such as the Spanish and Portuguese colonization of South America, have impacted the genetic makeup of those regions.In contrast, the Crusaders relatively short-lived presence in the Middle East, has had less of a genetic impact."They made big efforts to expel them, and succeeded after a couple of hundred years," said Tyler-Smith.The scientists found that the DNA of modern Lebanese people has more in common with people living in the region when it was part of the Roman Empire 2,000 years ago.CRUSADER-ERA HAND GRENADE SURPRISES ARCHAEOLOGISTS Other stunning Crusader-era discoveries have been garnering attention recently.The room venerated as the site of Jesus Last Supper, for example, has been revealed in stunning detail thanks to remarkable 3D laser scanning technology.The Cenacle is part of a church built by the Crusaders over an earlier 4th-century Byzantine church.Last year, experts discovered a Gothic hall at a medieval Crusader fortress in northern Israel.The ceremonial hall found in Galilee's Montfort Castle offers a fascinating glimpse into the turbulent Crusader era in the Holy Land, which began in the 11th century and lasted until the 13th century.In 2017, amazing medieval jewelry was found during the excavation of a Crusader castle on Tittora Hill in the town of Modiin-Maccabim-Reut.In 2016, a centuries-old hand grenade that may date back to the time of the Crusaders was among a host of treasures retrieved from the sea in Israel.The hand grenade was a common weapon in Israel during the Crusader era.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Over decades, archaeologists have also uncovered the ruins of the once-thriving Crusader city in the modern Israeli city of Acre.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
Snake devours huge frogmouth outside woman's window, disturbing video shows:::::An Australian woman was sipping her coffee when she noticed some feathers flying around outside.As she looked out of a window behind her, she was shocked to discover a large snake coiled around a tawny frogmouth a stocky bird that resembles an owl.Nicola Moore quickly took to Facebook to share photos of the horrific sight, noting in one picture you can see the jaw of the snake, identified as a carpet python, around the bird's head."Tawny Frogmouth is like an owl.The snake is a constrictor, so not venomous, but pretty fond of squeezing," Moore explained to curious Facebook users earlier this month."This guy is pretty big, probably close to 2 metres.We have other very venomous snakes."INDIANA HIKER SPOTS HUGE SNAKE HANGING FROM TREE BRANCH Dozens of people praised Moore's "fantastic capture," encouraging her to post more footage."Pretty big coastal python to take on the owl it wont need to [eat] again for a bit and will go off in a food coma for a while.Hubby has one as a pet its amazing watching them dislocate their jaws to devour their prey ours is just under 2 mtrs long and chugs down on 8 inch rats & wont be long before they go into brumation for the winter months.Hope you get some more great photos i know my hubby would love seeing them," one friend replied.Moore agreed that it would likely be devouring the frogmouth for "a good while.""We have lots of photos.No need to even zoom, we can take touch them both," she replied, in part.BLOODSUCKING WORMS FOUND IN FLORIDA RATTLESNAKE SPECIES ALARM RESEARCHERS: 'IT'S A NASTY SITUATION' The woman from New South Wales then went outside to capture some video of the bizarre battle.A minute-long clip shows the snake tightening its grip around the bird's neck as it bites down on its head.She then put her hand on the window to show viewers just how big the snake's prey really was.And for those who were curious if the snake managed to finish its meal Moore confirmed the snake's eyes really were bigger than its stomach."In the end it didn't manage to completely swallow the bird, so cats, dogs and kids would be too big.They are often kept as pets, and seen as being quite harmless.We do get a few very venomous snakes, but everyone is raised knowing how to deal with them," she explained.A carpet snake is a non-venomous snake with a thick body covered in yellow and white speckles.It's one of the largest snakes in Australia and is a popular choice for a pet in the region, Northern Territory Government states online.
Hiker discovers cute 'abandoned puppy,' gets big surprise:::::A hiker in Southern California thought he had found an abandoned puppy in a canyon recently.The cute animal, however, was not all that it seemed.The San Diego Union-Tribune reports that the man was walking his dog when he spotted what he thought was an abandoned puppy.The hiker picked the animal up and took it home, where he called the San Diego Humane Society.Wildlife officers then went to the mans home, where they examined the animal.WOLF INSIDE PET DOGS HELPS THEM COOPERATE WITH HUMANS, STUDY FINDS Our Humane Officers recently received a call about an abandoned puppy in a canyon in Tierrasanta.To their surprise, the little creature was actually a coyote pup!explained the San Diego Humane Society, in a Facebook post.The officers took the adorable pup to Project Wildlife for care before being transferred to The Fund for Animals Wildlife Center.Citing an officer at Project Wildlife, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports that too much time had elapsed since the pups rescue for the animal to be returned to the canyon where she was found.Coyotes often move their dens, something that the pups mother may have been doing when the well-meaning hiker scooped the animal up and brought her home.DOGS WERE DOMESTICATED IN NORTH AMERICA 10,000 YEARS AGO, STUDY SAYS The Fund for Animals Wildlife Center, which cares for native California predatory species, says that the coyote is doing well.Our goal is always to raise orphans with other conspecifcs and eventually return them to their native habitat once they reach natural dispersal age, it explained, in a Facebook post.The hard part with this little girl is that she came in so early in the season, we were unable to pair her up with another orphaned pup.Though our goal is always to release ill, injured or orphaned wildlife - the final status of the pup is yet to be determined, the center added.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Earlier this year, dam workers in Estonia rescued what they thought was a dog from a frozen river, only to discover that it was a wolf.Fox News Anna Hopkins contributed to this article.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
The Hubble just took a gorgeous new image of the Southern Crab Nebula's wonky gas bubbles:::::Twenty years ago, the Hubble Space Telescope revealed a giant crab in the sky.Now, just before its 29th birthday (Hubble was launched into space April 24, 1990), the telescope again trains its lenses on the Southern Crab Nebula to provide the world with a stunning reminder that, a) the cosmos is mysterious and beautiful, and, b) launching giant cameras into space is a really neat idea.Every year, Hubble spends a small portion of its time snapping a gorgeous anniversary picture like this one, according to a statement from the European Space Agency (ESA), the agency that manages the telescope in cooperation with NASA.The decision to image the Southern Crab Nebula for this year's birthday photo recalls the first encounter between the photographer and its subject in 1998, when Hubble imaged the complete hourglass structure of the nebula for the first time.[Spaced Out!101 Astronomy Images That Will Blow Your Mind] The Southern Crab Nebula sits in the constellation Centaurus, about 7,000 light-years away from Earth.What look like the legs and pincers of a cosmic crab are actually twin bubbles of gas and dust burped out by a pair of stars at the nebula's center.This celestial Odd Couple is composed of one red giant a huge, dying star in the process of molting its outer shell of matter and one white dwarf the tiny, dead husk of hot crystal that remains once a red giant has loosed its last burst of gas.According to the ESA, this binary duo coexists in a relationship where the dying red giant continuously feeds gas and dust into the white dwarf via its gravitational pull.After piling up for thousands of years, all that space schmutz may spark an eruption on the white dwarf's sizzling surface, sending matter scattering through space in giant bubbles.Astronomers think this has happened twice in the relatively recent past, giving rise to the twin splatters of glowing matter visible in Hubble's images of the nebula.A similar celestial explosion could even happen again under Hubble's watch, turning this giant space crab into what?A Three-Leafed Clover Nebula?A Sprig of Holly Nebula?Call us crabby but, somehow, those nicknames just don't have the same ring to them.Originally published on Live Science.
NASA spots mysterious galactic 'jellyfish' in space:::::Jellyfish have been on Earth for approximately 500 million years, making them the longest surviving creature on the planet.But now, NASA has a "jellyfish" of its own in space.The government space agency said a "jellyfish"-like galaxy, known as ESO 137-001, with a tail made up of long gas stretching 260,000 light-years across space, is "swimming" into the view of the space agency's forthcoming James Webb Telescope."Blue ribbons of young stars dangle from the galaxys disk like cosmic tentacles," NASA said in the statement."If you look at the galaxy in X-ray light, however, you will find a giant tail of hot gas streaming behind the galaxy.After launch, NASAs James Webb Space Telescope will study ESO 137-001 to learn how the gas is being removed from the galaxy, and why stars are forming within that gaseous tail."NASA WANTS TO SEND ASTRONAUTS TO MOON'S MYSTERIOUS SOUTH POLE The James Webb Telescope is slated for launch in 2021.The "jellyfish" was first observed by the Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory in 2014.ESO 137-001 isn't exactly close to Earth, even though it's similar in appearance to the Milky Way galaxy.It's approximately 220 million light-years away from our planet and is part of the Triangulum Australe constellation and is part of a galaxy cluster known as Abell 3627.Galaxy clusters are surrounded by hot gases that eventually form stars.However, how the stars form in the tail and the time it takes for that to happen is still puzzling to researchers.Both gas and dust are getting stripped off, but how much and what happens to the stripped material and the galaxy itself are still open questions, said Stacey Alberts of the University of Arizona, a co-investigator on the project,in the statement.We think its hard to strip off a molecular cloud thats already forming stars because it should be tightly bound to the galaxy by gravity," Alberts added."Which means either were wrong, or this gas got stripped off and heated up, but then had to cool again so that it could condense and form stars.Telling these two scenarios apart is one of the things we want to get at.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Einstein letter defending his Jewish heritage up for auction:::::Shortly before the start of World War II, Albert Einstein, perhaps the world's most famous theoretical physicist, wrote a letter to a colleague detailing his thoughts on the "power of the resistance" of the Jewish people.And now that letter is set to go up for auction and it could fetch a staggering sum.The letter, postmarked June 10, 1939, and sent to E.J.Brown of the Arnold Constable & Co. department store, congratulates Brown for the work he did for refugees during Dedication Week."The power of resistance which has enabled the Jewish people to survive for thousands of years has been based to a large extent on traditions of mutual helpfulness," Einstein wrote in letter."In these years of affliction our readiness to help one another is being put to an especially severe test.May we stand this test as well as did our fathers before us."SHOCKING EINSTEIN LETTERS, REVEALING 'HITLER-INSANITY,' UP FOR AUCTION He continued: "We have no other means of self-defense than our solidarity and our knowledge that the cause for which we are suffering is a momentous and sacred cause."Dedication Week was a campaign to raise public consciousness regarding the need for Jewish rescue.Less than two weeks before sending this letter, Einstein gave the official dedication speech for the Jewish Palestine Pavilion at the New York Worlds Fair to a crowd of 100,000 visitors.The letter is set to be auctioned by Nate D. Sanders and has a starting price of $20,000.Einstein had written similar letters attesting to the "power of resistance" of the Jewish people, including one he wrote two days later."The power of resistance which has enabled the Jewish people to survive for thousands of years has been based to a large extent on traditions of mutual helpfulness," Einstein wrote in the June 12 letter."In these years of affliction our readiness to help one another is being put to an especially severe test.May we stand this test as well as did our fathers before us."That letter, sent to Dr. Maurice Lenz, sold for $134,344, the auction house added.RARE EINSTEIN LETTERS, REVEALING HIS ESCAPE FROM THE NAZIS, UP FOR AUCTION In recent months, Einstein's letters have garnered significant interest at auction.In March, along with the June 12, 1939 letter, two other letters went up for auction, including one which he detailed his thoughts on "Hitler insanity."In December, a letter in which he discussed his Jewish faith as well as "man's eternal search for meaning" sold for a record-breaking $2.89 million.In October 2017, Einstein's note on the theory of happiness sold to an unknown buyer at a Jerusalem auction for $1.56 million.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News' Sasha Savitsky contributed to this story.
Living 'balloon on a string' discovered in the deepest part of the Indian Ocean:::::The depths of the Indian Ocean are home to some bizarre creatures including one that looks like a balloon on a string.Explorers captured a video of this gelatinous creature in a recent dive to the Java Trench, the bottommost part of the Indian Ocean.This dive was one of many in the Five Deeps Expedition, during which the crew aimed to reach the deepest part of all five of the world's oceans."We were just watching the video back and saw the thing come out of the darkness," said Alan Jamieson, the chief scientist on the expedition and a senior lecturer at Newcastle University in the U.K. "It drifted right towards the camera... and then drifted off again."[In Photos: Spooky Deep-Sea Creatures] With its long appendage, "almost like a tentacle that holds onto something," it looked like a balloon on a string, he added.After a literature search, Jamieson found a group in Japan that had described something similar about 20 years ago a species of stalked ascidian or sea squirt.But there were key differences between the newly found creature and the one described in the literature the latter had filaments coming off the top of its head, whereas this one doesn't, he said.There's a "high probability" of this being a new species, since there's no record of such a creature that far down at over 6,500 meters (21,300 feet) he said.This creature likely anchors itself to the seafloor with its long tentacle, perhaps to keep still in a seismically active seafloor, he said.(Trenches are "seismically active" because they are dips on the seafloor where one tectonic plate is pushed beneath another).As for why the tentacle is so long, Jamieson suggested it might help the creature filter feed up to 3.3 feet (1 meter) above the seafloor.Because the deepest parts of four out of the five oceans have never been visited by humans before, "it's not a big surprise to our science team that we're spotting some creatures that we are pretty sure are new species," said the creator of the expedition Victor Vescovo, an explorer and businessman, who makes the first dive down to the depths, typically solo, in a small titanium-and-glass sphere submersible.But not all of the critters they came across were alien to the members of the crew.They saw more familiar creatures such as starfish and sea cucumbers and several hadal snailfish palm-size, pinkish, tadpole-like critters with small black eyes and semitransparent bodies, through which their liver is clearly visible.These snailfish "may not be a new species [because they] look much the same," but it's kind of "interesting" that we have seen it in the deep part of every ocean so far, Jamieson said.Before they visited the Java Trench in the Indian Ocean, the team members dove down to the trenches of the Atlantic Ocean and the Southern Ocean around Antarctica both of which are home to similar snailfish.Of all three of the oceans, the Indian Ocean seems to be the one most dense with life, Vescovo said.But, it's also the one that's very undersampled.There's "hardly any record at all," of the creatures down there, Jamieson added.The members of the research group hope to analyze some of the videos and photos they took down in the depths of our world and publish some findings about their research.In addition, their dives are being filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary series set to air toward the end of the year.The next stop, in two weeks, is the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean, the deepest part of any of the oceans.This trench is the only one that has been explored by humans but only twice before, Vescovo said.U.S.Lieutenant Don Walsh and Swiss engineer Jacques Piccard first dove down to the trench back in 1960 and Canadian explorer and filmmaker James Cameron set the record for going the deepest in 2012.Originally published on Live Science.

Titanic victim’s long-lost letter surfaces, describes near miss as doomed ship set out on its maiden voyage:::::A letter written by one of Titanics crew to his wife just days before the doomed liner sank in the icy waters of the North Atlantic is up for auction in the U.K. Titanic steward Richard Geddes wrote the letter to his wife, Sarah (Sal), the day after the famous ship left the port of Southampton, U.K., on April 10, 1912.The letter describes a near collision with another ship, the SS City of New York.The two ships reportedly came within a few feet of each other as Titanic left Southampton docks on its maiden voyage.My dearest Sal, We got away yesterday after a lot of trouble, Geddes wrote.As we were passing the New York and Oceanic the New York broke her ropes and very nearly ran into us, but we just happened to avoid a collision.DID THIS ICEBERG SINK THE TITANIC?The incident was perceived by some as a bad omen and a sign of trouble ahead, according to Encyclopedia Titanica.A collision would have prevented the ill-fated liners transatlantic journey to New York.Titanic hit an iceberg at 11:40 p.m. ship's time on April 14, 1912, and sank just over two hours later.Geddes, along with 1,500 others, perished in the disaster.TITANIC MENU SURFACES, OFFERS GLIMPSE INTO DOOMED LINER'S FINAL DAYS I hope you are feeling good and not worrying, Geddes continued, in the poignant letter to his wife.I am feeling pretty good.With fondest love and kisses to my dear wife and kiddies.Your affectionate husband Dick xxxxx The letter was mailed from Queenstown, Ireland when Titanic picked up passengers there on April 11, 1912.The artifact is being sold with its original envelope, an official document describing Geddes supposed death at sea and photos of the seaman and his wife.SAILING TO DISASTER: RARE TITANIC PHOTOS UP FOR AUCTION Its an exceptional letter on many levels, first and foremost it was written on board the Titanic, it has its envelope, the lot also contains official paperwork relating to Mr. Geddes and finally the content is superb, describing the near miss that Titanic nearly suffered that would have changed history, auctioneer Andrew Aldridge told Fox News, via email.The lot, which will be auctioned by Henry Aldridge and Son on April 27, has a pre-sale estimate of $155,885 to $233,827.More than 100 years after the Titanics sinking, the disaster continues to be a source of fascination.A CENTURY AFTER THE LUSITANIA WAS SUNK BY A U-BOAT, AN UNUSUAL ITEM FROM THE DOOMED LINER EMERGES In 2017, a sea-stained letter recovered from the body of a Titanic victim was sold at auction for $166,000.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In 2016, the sextant used by the captain of rescue ship Carpathia sold for just under $97,000.A year earlier, a cup presented to the captain by Titanic survivor Molly Brown to the Carpathia captain sold for $200,000.Follow James Rogers on Twitter @jamesjrogers
SpaceX to launch cargo resupply mission despite Crew Dragon mishap:::::SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket is pictured with a Dragon cargo spacecraft on Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, prior to a launch in 2010.File Photo by Joe Marino-Bill Cantrell/UPI | License Photo April 22 (UPI) -- The "anomaly" experienced by SpaceX's Crew Dragon over the weekend won't affect the company's planned space station resupply mission.According to NASA officials, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket is still scheduled to launch the company's Dragon cargo spacecraft on April 30."The NASA and SpaceX teams are still assessing the anomaly that occurred, but I can tell you we are still tracking, as of today, for Tuesday, April 30, and that launch will be at 4:22 a.m. Eastern time," NASA public affairs officer Joshua Finch told reporters during a teleconference on Monday, according to Space.com.The resupply mission was originally scheduled to blast-off on April 26, but last week, NASA announced a delay."April 30 is the most viable date for both NASA and SpaceX due to station and orbital mechanics constraints," the space agency noted in an update.On Saturday, a cloud of smoke rising from test facilities at Cape Canaveral could be seen from miles away.Reports confirmed the smoke was the result of an explosive accident involving SpaceX's Crew Dragon.Both SpaceX and NASA acknowledged the failure.SpaceX referred to the accident an "anomaly" during the final of a series of engine test fires."Ensuring that our systems meet rigorous safety standards and detecting anomalies like this prior to flight are the main reasons why we test," SpaceX told UPI in released statement."Our teams are investigating and working closely with our NASA partners."An unverified video of the accident, first published by Business Insider, shows what appears to the Crew Dragon spacecraft being destroyed by a fiery explosion.Though SpaceX has yet to confirm the authenticity of the video, the company did report that the anomaly was quickly contained and that no one was injured."The NASA and SpaceX teams are assessing the anomaly that occurred today during a part of the Dragon Super Draco Static Fire Test at SpaceX Landing Zone 1 in Florida," NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine tweeted on Saturday."This is why we test.We will learn, make the necessary adjustments and safely move forward with our Commercial Crew Program."The exploded spacecraft was the same vessel that completed the first commercial crew program test flight earlier this year.The Crew Dragon capsule was supposed to conduct another test flight this summer.The latest accident could jeopardize NASA's plans to launch American astronauts from the United States.Currently, the space agency and its astronauts rely on Russian rockets and crew capsules to ferry Americans to and from ISS -- an agreement with Roscosmos that ends in early 2020.
Female sand tiger sharks visit the same shipwrecks off North Carolina coast:::::Female sand tiger sharks regularly return to the same shipwrecks off the N.C. coast.Photo by John McCord/Coastal Studies Institute April 22 (UPI) -- Every year or two, female sand tiger sharks return to the same shipwrecks off the North Carolina coast.A survey of photographs taken by citizen scientists revealed multiple visits by the same female sand tiger sharks at the same shipwrecks, or similar nearby shipwrecks.The intervals in between visits ranged from one to 72 months.The study, published this week in the journal Ecology, suggests the shipwrecks are important habitats for the vulnerable species."Their population is estimated to have dropped by as much as or more than 75 percent in the 1980s and 1990s and we don't know if it has stabilized or is still declining, in large part because we've mostly had to rely on anecdotal sightings," Avery B. Paxton, a visiting scholar at the Duke University Marine Laboratory, said in a news release."Having photographic evidence that these wrecks form an important habitat the sharks return to from time to time gives us a focal point for ongoing research so we can better understand how the species is faring."Scientists aren't sure why the female sharks regularly return to the same shipwrecks.It's possible the sharks are using the sites as rest stops on their migrations.The females could also be coming to mate or give birth.Because each sand tiger shark has a unique pattern of brown spots, a fingerprint of sorts, scientists can easily recognize individual sharks.Scientists spotted six repeat shipwreck visitors among images in the Spot A Shark USA database, which is managed by North Carolina Aquariums."This is the first time we've been able to document site fidelity to habitats in offshore waters along the East Coast," Paxton said."Previous studies have shown similar behavior patterns in Australia and Africa and in estuarine habitats such as Delaware Bay, so what we are finding off North Carolina definitely fits into global patterns."RELATED Great white sharks are capable of high speeds but prefer to mosey Males may also be regularly visiting the same shipwrecks, but so far there's not photographic evidence.Studying small and elusive populations of sharks is difficult, but by collaborating with divers and citizen scientists, researchers can gain insights into the movement patterns and behaviors of vulnerable species like the sand tiger shark.
New additive yields longer-lasting lithium batteries:::::The addition of a boron nitride film allowed scientists to use lithium in a solid electrolyte battery.Photo by Pixabay/CC April 22 (UPI) -- As electric vehicles and other battery-powered technologies proliferate, scientists are searching for ways to make energy storage safer and more resilient.One team of researchers has found a way to prolong battery life of lithium metal batteries.When scientists added a nano-coating of boron nitride to the electrolytes in lithium metal batteries, the batteries were more stable and lasted longer.Lithium ion batteries are used in everything from electric cars to smart phones, but they aren't very energy dense and the liquid electrolyte inside them is flammable.As a result of their instability, the batteries have a relatively short life.Batteries with a lithium metal anode, instead of a graphite anode, can store more energy and deliver a more powerful charge.But the anode's lithium plating can birth deformities called dendrites.The branch-like growths can penetrate the membrane wall, the separator between the anode and cathode, compromising the battery's safety and performance.RELATED Rice scientists say nanotube film could make for better batteries "We decided to focus on solid, ceramic electrolytes.They show great promise in improving both safety and energy density, as compared with conventional, flammable electrolytes in lithium ion batteries," Yuan Yang, assistant professor of materials science and engineering at Columbia University, said in a news release."We are particularly interested in rechargeable solid-state lithium batteries because they are promising candidates for next-generation energy storage."Solid electrolytes are more powerful and stable than liquid electrolytes, and they can also curb lithium dendrite growth.But lithium causes most solid electrolytes to corrode."Lithium metal is indispensable for enhancing energy density and so it's critical that we be able to use it as the anode for solid electrolytes," said Qian Cheng, a postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia.RELATED New material can remove salt and metal ions from seawater To successfully use lithium in a solid electrolyte battery, scientists had to find a chemically and mechanically stable interface -- an interface with a variety of qualities."It is essential that the interface not only be highly electronically insulating, but also ionically conducting in order to transport lithium ions," Cheng said."Plus, this interface has to be super-thin to avoid lowering the energy density of batteries."In the lab, scientists deposited a thin protective layer of a boron nitride nano-film between the lithium metal and the solid electrolyte, the ionic conductor.Researchers created the nano-film with intrinsic defects that allowed lithium ions to travel through it."It's the perfect material to function as a barrier that prevents the invasion of lithium metal to solid electrolyte," Cheng said."Like a bullet-proof vest, we've developed a lithium-metal-proof 'vest' for unstable solid electrolytes and, with that innovation, achieved long cycling lifetime lithium metal batteries."Researchers are now testing the boron nitride nano-film with several different types of solid electrolytes.They expect the new technology -- described this week in the journal Joule -- to be used in the near future to create solid-state batteries with improved performance and longer lifetimes.
Slime mold memorizes foreign substances by absorbing them:::::Slime molds absorbed a salty solution and learned to tolerate the harmless but foreign substance.Photo by David Villa/CNRS Photothque April 22 (UPI) -- The slime mold Physarum polycephalum doesn't have a nervous system, yet the single-celled organism is capable of learning and communicating.According to a new study, published this week in the journal Philosophical Transaction of the Royal Society B, the mold learns via fusion.A team of biologists at the French National Center for Scientific Research determined the molds learn by absorbing the foreign substance.After researchers had the slime molds move across salty environments for six days, the molds contained ten times more salt than molds in a control group.When researchers placed the salty slime molds back in a salt-free environment, the single-celled organisms expelled the salt within two days -- purging the "memory" of the foreign substance.In a followup test, scientists injected a salt concentration into molds previously unexposed to salty environs.When placed in a salty environment, the molds behaved just like the molds that had become conditioned to the foreign substance.Slime molds enter a dormant stage when environmental conditions worsen, but researchers found the dormant molds held onto their memories."We showed that information acquired during the training was preserved through the dormant stage as slime molds still showed habituation after a one-month dormancy period," researchers wrote.Scientists are currently conducting additional experiments to determine whether slime molds can memorize multiple foreign substances at once.
Giant tortoise migration follows upredictable pattern:::::The seed dispersal services of Galapagos giant tortoises are essential to many plants on the islands.Photo by Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau April 22 (UPI) -- Generally speaking, Galapagos giant tortoises spend the islands' dry season on the volcanic slopes, where low-hanging clouds provide water for vegetation.During the wet season, the turtles typically return to the lush lowlands.But when researchers tracked the migration patterns of Galapagos giant tortoises over several years, they found the reptiles' movements are weakly associated with local climate conditions.Before their tracking efforts began, scientists assumed they would discover a shift in the timing of the tortoise's migration -- a shift matching changes in climate."Many animals, such as ungulates, can track current environmental conditions and migrate accordingly -- what researchers sometime refer to as surfing the green-wave," Guillaume Bastille-Rousseau, ecologist at the State University of New York, said in a news release.At the study's outset, Bastille-Rousseau and his colleagues had three main goals."One was determining if tortoises adjust their timing of migration to current environmental conditions," Bastille-Rousseau said."Two, if so, what clues do they use to adjust the timing, and, three, what are the energetic consequences of migration mis-timing for tortoises?"The collected data showed the movements of Galapagos giant tortoises are only weakly associated with fog, rain and temperature.Prolonged periods of unusually dry conditions don't inspire the tortoises to move to higher ground earlier than usual.RELATED Island formation promotes penguin diversity The research -- published in the journal Ecology -- doesn't necessarily suggest tortoises are oblivious to their surroundings or changes in climate.But it does suggest scientists don't fully grasp the factors driving the reptiles' movement patterns."Tortoise timing of migration fluctuated a lot among years, often by over two months," Bastille-Rousseau said."This indicates that migration for tortoises may not just be about foraging opportunities.For example, female tortoises have to make decisions related to nesting, and we still have a lot to learn about migration in giant tortoises."The giant tortoises are important ecosystem engineers, clearing vegetation and dispersing seeds across the islands.As climate change continues, it's possible the timing of the tortoise's migration could become increasingly misaligned with optimal conditions."One concern is that at some point in the future, migration may not be an optimal strategy for tortoises," Bastille-Rousseau said."There may be a reduction in the number of individuals doing these long-distance movements.This would likely have cascading consequences for the whole ecosystem."
Children judge people based on facial features, just like adults:::::Children judges people based on how their faces look.Photo by mbpogue/Pxhere April 19 (UPI) -- Children judge and adjust their behavior toward people based on the person's facial features, just like adults do.Previous studies have detailed the way various facial features -- the tilt of a person's mouth or distance between a person's eyes, for example -- influence a person's perception and expectations of another person.These preconceived notions, formed in an instant, can affect how people behave toward the person.Research suggests these subconscious prejudices can influence the hiring process, voting decisions or even jury deliberations.But until now, psychologists had only studied such prejudices in adults.The latest study, published this week in the journal Developmental Psychology, suggests children as young as five also judge people based on facial features.RELATED Worms help scientists understand memory formation and recall Researchers used the results of previous studies to design computer animated faces to look trustworthy or untrustworthy, dominant or submissive and competent or incompetent.When they showed the digital faces to children, the study participants were more likely to rate the trustworthy, dominant and competent faces as "nice," and the others as "mean."In follow up tests, researchers determined children made similarly prejudiced judgements about less stereotyped faces -- faces with more subtle features.Researchers also determined the children expected the stereotyped faces to do stereotypical things.The dominant face was more likely to be the face of someone who "picks up heavy things," according to the children."This shows that children from as early as kindergarten use facial appearance to determine meaningful judgments and expectations of others' behavior," Tessa E.S.Charlesworth, researcher at Harvard University, said in a news release.When asked to choose to give a treat to one of two people, study participants were more likely to give a cookie to the "nice" looking faces."By age five, children were consistently above chance in giving their gifts to the trustworthy- or submissive-looking faces," said Charlesworth.The latest findings dispel the myth that children are without prejudice."This research shows that perceptions of people, however inaccurate those judgments may be, emerge early in humans," said Harvard researcher Mahzarin R. Banaji."What this study uniquely shows is that these inaccuracies don't just sit around in a child's head, they manifest in the child's behavior toward others who are viewed as good or bad based on features of the face that are irrelevant to decisions about character and personality."
Ancent Peruvian microbrewery, sour ale helps explain longevity of the Wari empire:::::The team worked with Peruvian brewers to recreate the ancient chicha recipe used at Cerro Baul.Photo by Donna Nash/University of North Carolina at Greensboro/Field Museum April 19 (UPI) -- The study of an ancient microbrewery in Peru and its supply of a sour beer has provided scientists new insights into the stability of the Wari empire.For several years, researchers have been studying the remains of a brewing site at Cerro Bal, an ancient city in southern Peru and the political center of the Wari empire, which lasted from 600 to 1100 AD -- a long time for an ancient dynasty.According to archaeologists, the brewing site played an important role in the development the empire's political organization."It was like a microbrewery in some respects.It was a production house, but the brewhouses and taverns would have been right next door," Ryan Williams, an associate curator and head of anthropology at the Field Museum in Chicago, said in a news release.Williams and his colleagues estimate political elites regularly gathered at the brewery to drink a locally made sour ale called chicha."[Chicha] was only good for about a week after being made, it wasn't shipped offsite -- people had to come to festivals at Cerro Bal to drink it," Williams said."These festivals were important to Wari society."For the latest study, researchers blasted the insides of one of the beer-drinking vessels with a laser.The laser helped separate a layer of the beverage from the ceramic.When researchers heated the ancient beer molecules, they were able to discern some of the ingredients.Scientists determined the sour ale was made using pepper berries, a drought resistant plant.They also confirmed the ceramic drinking vessels were locally made.The findings -- published this week in the journal Sustainability -- suggests the Wari's beer supply was immune to unfavorable weather and trading disruptions.Even when instabilities arose, the Wari empire always had beer.Researchers at the Field Museum suggest the beverage was a tool of political unity."We think these institutions of brewing and then serving the beer really formed a unity among these populations, it kept people together," said Williams.
River dolphin may provide new insights into marine mammal communication:::::Scientists recorded more than 270 sounds used by a mysterious river dolphin species in Brazil.Photo by Paulo Castro April 19 (UPI) -- A mysterious river dolphin in Brazil, previously thought to be relatively silent, could offer new insights into the evolutionary origins of marine mammal communication.It turns out, the river dolphin scientists thought was solitary and mostly speechless actually boasts an impressive vocabulary."We found that they do interact socially and are making more sounds than previously thought," Laura May Collado, a biologist at the University of Vermont, said in a news release."Their vocal repertoire is very diverse."Because Araguaian dolphins are skittish, they're difficult to study.But Gabriel Melo-Santos, a biologist from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, found a riverside fish market in Brazil where the normally shy animals come to be fed fish by the locals.Researchers regularly visited the fish market to watch the phenomenon and observe how the river dolphins behave and interact.The regular visits and clear river water allowed scientists to track individual dolphins and study the relationships between different individuals.During their visits to the fish market, scientists collected 20 hours of vocal recordings and identified 237 different types of sounds.But researchers suspect they've only observed a portion of the dolphin's full vocal repertoire.The vocalizations of the Araguaian dolphins feature a unique mix of low-frequency calls, most commonly used by baleen whales to communicate across great expanses of ocean, and high-frequency calls used by marine dolphins for more intimate conversations.The species' unique habitat likely shaped the evolution of the dolphin's vocabulary."There are a lot of obstacles like flooded forests and vegetation in their habitat, so this signal could have evolved to avoid echoes from vegetation and improve the communication range of mothers and their calves," May Collado said.Scientists heard one particular type of sound more than others: short, two-part calls used by babies as they swam toward their moms."It's exciting; marine dolphins like the bottlenose use signature whistles for contact, and here we have a different sound used by river dolphins for the same purpose," said May Collado.River dolphins diverged from cetaceans earlier than other dolphins, making them evolutionary relics.By studying these dolphins and comparing their vocabulary to the communication abilities of other closely related river dolphins, scientists expect to gain new insights into the evolution of marine mammal communication.Scientists shared their analysis of the Araguaian dolphin's vocalizations this week in the journal PeerJ.
Rare metal improves performance of energy-harvesting piezoelectric crystals:::::Scientists improved the performance of electricity-harvesting crystals by adding the rare earth metal samarium.Photo by Wikimedia Commons April 19 (UPI) -- Researchers have discovered that the addition of a rare earth metal significantly improves the performance of piezoelectric crystals.Piezoelectric crystals are used in sensors, including underwater sonars and medical ultrasound imaging devices.These technologies use perovskite oxide crystals, or PMN-PT crystals.Scientists have also tried to use piezoelectric crystals, which convert mechanical oscillations into electricity, to power wearable electronics and other types of novel technologies.An international team of scientists from Australia, China and the United States found a way to improve the performance of PMN-PT crystals.Scientists added samarium atoms during the crystal growth process -- one samarium atom per thousand atoms of the parent crystal -- and found the additive created more homogeneous piezoelectric properties inside the crystal, boosting the crystal's performance.The piezoelectric coefficient, quantified in picocoulombs per Newton, describes the efficiency of a material's piezoelectric properties.More efficient piezoelectric crystals do more with less.In lab tests, scientists confirmed that conventional PMN-PT crystals feature a piezoelectric coefficient between 1,200 and 2,500 pC/N.PMN-PT crystals enhanced with samarium produced 3,400 to 4,100 pC/N.Scientists also noted that the addition of samarium granted the crystals more uniform, or homogeneous, physical properties."These crystals are ideal for a variety of sensing applications and could reduce cost by eliminating waste," researchers wrote in their study, published this week in the journal Science.
Cygnus cargo spaceship bolted to International Space Station:::::The Cygnus space freighter is seen carrying about 7,600 pounds of cargo during it's approach to the International Space Station on Friday morning.Photo by NASA April 19 (UPI) -- The Cygnus cargo spacecraft was bolted into place on the International Space Station early Friday morning, bringing 7,600 pounds of research and supplies to the station.The cargo vessel was attached to the Unity module on ISS at 7:31 a.m. EDT, where it will remain until July 23, while flying about 225 miles above the Indian Ocean.NASA astronaut Anne McClain received the Cygnus cargo spacecraft at 5:28 a.m. EDT with the International Space Station's robotic arm while the ISS was over France.NASA TV provided live coverage of the event beginning at 4 a.m. RELATED Astronaut Christina Koch to break female spaceflight record McClain was assisted by astronaut David Saint-Jacques of the Canadian Space Agency.Space station crew members will begin unloading the cargo later today.Included in the cargo ship are several scientific experiments.The Advanced Colloids Experiment-Temperature-10 will study the behavior of gels in microgravity.The findings could help material scientists develop new kinds of useful materials.Another study will test the effects of spaceflight on the immune systems of lab mice.The rodent immune system closely parallels the human immune system, and researchers are keen to better understand the effects of extended stays in space on human health.Another study will focus on the effects of microgravity on the human vasculature system."The Vascular Aging investigation uses ultrasounds, blood samples, oral glucose tolerance tests, and wearable sensors to study aging-like changes that occur in many astronauts during their stay on the space station," according to NASA.Cygnus was launched into space from Virginia's Eastern Shore on Wednesday.The cargo ship was carried into space by Northrop Grumman's Antares rocket.The launch was Northrop Grumman's 11th commercial resupply mission for NASA.Once Cygnus is received and installed, crew members aboard ISS will begin unloading the more than 7,600 pounds of food, supplies, equipment and science experiments.
When zapped with a laser, magnets behave like fluids:::::Researchers have discovered how magnetic particles reorganize their spins in the wake of the disruption caused by a laser blast.Photo by Benjamin Crowell/Wikimedia Commons April 18 (UPI) -- Scientists have managed to figure out how a magnet manages to recover after being demagnetized by a brief laser blast.The discovery suggests lasers make magnets behave like fluids.When an ultra thin magnet is hit with a laser, it suddenly becomes demagnetized.Materials with magnetic properties feature subatomic building blocks all spinning in the same direction.There is order to the organization of the magnet's particles -- a laser blast disrupts this order.Scientists have previously detailed the atomic chaos that ensues in the wake of the laser strike.And researchers know what a magnet looks like once it's reorganized.The recovery process, which lasts just a fraction of a second, has, until now, remained poorly understood."Researchers have addressed what happens 3 picoseconds after a laser pulse and then when the magnet is back at equilibrium after a microsecond," mathematician Ezio Iacocca, researcher at the University of Colorado, Boulder, said in a news release."In between, there's a lot of unknown."In the lab, researchers blasted gadolinium-iron-cobalt alloys with lasers.They compared the results of their experiments with computer simulations designed to predict the behavior of laser-blasted atoms.The mathematical formulas describing the atoms showed the magnetized particles behave like a fluid in the wake of a laser blast.The material, or magnet, itself doesn't become fluid-like, but the atomic spins behave like a fluid.The spin directions of the magnet's atomic units slosh around like ocean waves.RELATED Microscopic roundabout directs light without a magnet "We used the mathematical equations that model these spins to show that they behaved like a superfluid at those short timescales," said Mark Hoefer, researcher at CU Boulder.Researchers shared the results of their analysis this week in the journal Nature Communications.If the surface of a calm pond on a windless day represents a magnet and its atomic spins, all perfectly synchronized, a laser blast is like a big rock tossed into the middle.Slowly but surely, the violent splash that results turns into gentle ripples, and soon enough, the surface of the pond is glassy smooth again.RELATED Physicists build 2D platinum magnet Hoefer likens the phenomena to a jar of oil and water that gets shaken.Once the shaking stop, bits of oil start to coalesce, forming larger and larger clumps until the oil and water are separated once more."In certain spots, the magnet starts to point up or down again," Hoefer said."It's like a seed for these larger groupings."Sometimes magnets reorganize their spins in the opposite direction after a disruption.Computer engineers take advantage of spin flips when they store information on computer hard drives.If scientist could find a way to engineer magnets capable of flipping their spins faster, they might be able to boost computer processing speeds."That's why we want to understand exactly how this process happens, so we can maybe find a material that flips faster," Iacocca said.
Scientists recover liquid blood from 42,000-year-old foal:::::Scientists claim the frozen foal is the best preserved Ice Age specimen ever found.Photo by Semyon Grigoryev/NEFU April 18 (UPI) -- An international team of scientists have extracted liquid blood and urine from a 42,000-year-old foal recovered Siberian permafrost.Russian and South Korean researchers hope to use the preserved fluids to clone the ancient horse species.Last summer, scientists at the Mammoth Museum at Northeastern Federal University found the prehistoric foal frozen in the permafrost of Batagaika crater.An autopsy revealed well preserved organs and tissue, and researchers were able to take liquid blood samples from the specimen's heart vessels."This is the best preserved Ice Age animal ever found in the world," Semyon Grigoryev, head of the Mammoth Museum in Yakutsk, told the Russian news service TASS.The autopsy suggested the foal drowned in mud.Shortly afterwards, the mud froze and became permafrost, creating ideal conditions for prolonged preservation.RELATED Woolly mammoth nuclei come alive inside mouse cells "An autopsy showed the foal carcass was extremely well-preserved, the body even without deformation," Grigoryev told CNN."The hair cover also preserved most parts of the carcass, especially at the head and legs."Grigoryev and his colleagues at Northeastern Federal University are working with scientists South Korean Sooam Biotech Research Foundation on several cloning projects, including efforts to clone the ancient foal and a woolly mammoth.Though researchers are trying to use the blood to extract viable cells for cloning, Grigoryev isn't particularly hopeful.RELATED Horse remains belong to unrecognized genus from last ice age "I think that even the unique preservation [of] blood is absolutely hopeless for cloning purposes since the main blood cells -- the red blood cells or erythrocytes -- do not have nuclei with DNA," he told CNN."We [are] trying to find intact cells in muscle tissue and internal organs that are also very well-preserved."Researchers found a similarly well-preserved mammoth frozen in Siberian ice in 2013.Scientists at the Mammoth Museum and Sooam are working to piece together a {link:mammoth genome: https://www.upi.com/Science_News/2015/07/02/Scientists-sequence-entire-woolly-mammoth-genome/6961435867398/" target="_blank"} using DNA fragments extracted from the mammoth."We're getting an unprecedented amount of access to mammoth samples through this collaboration," Insung Hwang, a geneticist at the biotech research firm Sooam, told a documentary film crew with the United Kingdom's Channel 4 several years ago."We're trying hard to make this possible within our generation."RELATED The last woolly mammoth populations suffered genomic meltdowns Sooam made headlines several years ago for their work cloning dogs.Many scientists have criticized the firm's ethics."Reviving species is controversial for a number of reasons, including the diminished quality of life for the clone, which will be subject to experiments during its entire life," reporter George Dvorsky wrote in Gizmodo.
Physicists aim to catch slow-decaying dark particle inside LHC:::::Physicists hope a new series of LHC experiments will help them isolate a heavy, slow-decaying dark particle that allows dark matter and energy to interact with regular matter.Photo by Zarija Lukic/Berkeley Lab April 18 (UPI) -- Scientists at the Large Hadron Collider have developed a new strategy for tracking down dark matter.Dark matter is apparently everywhere, binding galaxies together.But astronomers can only intimate dark matter's presence by measuring its gravitational effect on regular matter.As such, dark matter and dark energy remains poorly understood."We know for sure there's a dark world, and there's more energy in it than there is in ours," LianTao Wang, a researcher at LHC and a professor of physics at the University of Chicago, said in a news release.To gain insights into this dark world, Wang and his colleagues are trying to isolate the dark particle that they estimate occasionally interacts with normal matter.Researchers predict the elusive particle is heavier and longer-lived than other subatomic particles.RELATED CERN reveals plans for new experiment to search for dark matter particles Wang and his research partners suggest that every once in a while -- once or twice a decade, maybe -- this mysterious dark particle gets tangled in the violent mashup of protons produced by the LHC."One particularly interesting possibility is that these long-lived dark particles are coupled to the Higgs boson in some fashion -- that the Higgs is actually a portal to the dark world," said Wang."It's possible that the Higgs could actually decay into these long-lived particles."When looking for a new kind of elusive particle, scientists face the same problem they always do.It's very difficult to locate a tiny particle inside the violent explosion of subatomic particles created inside LHC's underground tunnels.RELATED Messier 94 forces scientists to rethink galaxy formation models However, scientists estimate the dark particle's properties will make it stand out more than others."If it's that heavy, it costs energy to produce, so its momentum would not be large -- it would move more slowly than the speed of light," said Fermilab scientist Zhen Liu.Physicists could simply tweak their algorithms to isolate particles that live and decay more slowly than the rest of subatomic shrapnel.Scientists would be searching for a time difference measuring less than a a billionth of a second, but Wang, Liu and their colleagues are confident LHC's sensors are sensitive enough to do the job.Scientists are now working to program the LHC's instruments to search for slow-decaying particles when the collider turns back on in 2021.Researchers described their plans for the new dark matter trap this month in the journal Physical Review Letters."We anticipate this method will increase our sensitivity to long-lived dark particles by more than an order of magnitude -- while using capabilities we already have at the LHC," Liu said.
Ancient urine details hunting-to-herding transition 10,000 years ago:::::Researchers measured ancient urine salt levels among the sediment layers at the Akl Hyk archaeological site in Turkey.Photo by Gne Duru April 18 (UPI) -- By measuring the changing concentration of urine salts at an archaeological site in Turkey, researchers are beginning to understand when and how hunter gatherers across the Near East began herding and farming.Archaeologists estimate the switch from hunting and gathering to farming and herding, the so-called Neolithic Revolution, began around 10,000 B.C.But questions about exactly how and where the change came about, and how fast change swept across the region, continue to trouble scientists.To get a better sense of the transition that inspired technological innovations and the birth of growing cities, scientists decided to study traces of ancient urine."This is the first time, to our knowledge, that people have picked up on salts in archaeological materials, and used them in a way to look at the development of animal management," lead researcher Jordan Abell, a graduate student at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, said in a news release.Abell and his colleagues tracked the changing concentrations of urine salts over a 1,000 year period, around the same time archaeological evidence suggests humans at the ancient Turkish site began domesticating animals.Their analysis showed that around 10,000 years ago, the concentration of humans and animals jumped from nearly zero to one human or animals for every 100 square feet.Scientists can't distinguish between urine salts left behind by humans and animals, but they determined the increase in the amount of urine salts can't be explained by humans alone.There weren't enough buildings to account for such a large increase in human inhabitants.Across the earliest layers of the settlement remains, between 10,400 to 10,000 years ago, scientists measured very few urine salts.Between 10,000 and 9,700 years ago, scientists recorded a 1,000-time increase in urine salt levels.The findings -- published this week in the journal Science Advances -- support the hypothesis that settlers began by corralling just a few sheep and goats, but relatively quickly developed the ability to manage domesticated animals and large scale.The new research also undermines the theory that the Neolithic Revolution had a single origin point and spread outward.Instead, the latest findings suggest the transition from hunting and gathering to farming and herding happened concurrently across a large swath of the Near East.
Scientists measure what makes viper fangs so sharp:::::To better understand what makes something sharp, scientists studied the shape and puncturing ability of viper fangs.Photo by L. Brian Stauffer/Field Museum of Natural History FMNH11006 April 17 (UPI) -- In an effort to figure out which physical characteristics best correlate with puncturing performance, scientists chose to study the sharpness of viper fangs."Viper fangs are a good case study for examining the effects of shape on sharpness, as they are specialized for puncture," Philip S. L. Anderson, an assistant professor of integrative biology at the University of Illinois, told UPI."Lots of animals have sharp teeth, but they often use those teeth for a variety of functions -- prey capture, mastication, grooming."Viper fangs work like hypodermic needles.They are designed and deployed to puncture the flesh of prey and deliver a lethal dose of venom.Anderson and his colleagues wanted to know what makes viper fangs so efficient.They set out to measure sharpness.But what exactly is sharpness?"This is really the heart of the study, as we didn't use any definition that was different from what others have used," Anderson said."Instead, we tested puncture performance to determine which of these previously used measures best correlates with performance."Researchers sourced 28 viper fangs from the Field Museum in Chicago.Using special instruments, scientists measured the roundness of each fang tip, the fang's surface area and the ability of each fang to puncture.RELATED Researchers restore functions to pig brains hours after death The team of scientists also created metal punches with different physical characteristics and pitted their puncturing performance against the viper fangs."Using synthetic punches, courtesy of our collaborators at Georgia Tech, allowed us to isolate functional effects of different measurements while the viper fangs allowed us to test whether the measures worked on actual biological structures," Anderson said.The analysis, published this week in the journal Biology Letters, showed the angle of the fang's tip was the best measure of sharpness, the ability to puncture.The study's authors hope their work will help scientists develope more efficient needles for various medical procedures."Biomedical engineers have been looking to biology for inspiration in the design of medical needles for many years," Anderson said."Our particular study gives new insight into what aspect of tip shape potentially has the greatest effect on puncture efficiency, which may be useful for certain needle designs."
Astronaut Christina Koch to break female spaceflight record:::::With her newly announced extended stay, astronaut Christina Koch will set a new record for longest spaceflight by a female.Photo by NASA April 17 (UPI) -- Astronaut Christina Koch will break the record for longest spaceflight by a female, according to NASA.The space agency on Wednesday announced that Koch will remain aboard the International Space Station until February 2020.Koch's extended stay will allow her to break the current record of 288 days, set in 2017 by NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson.Koch's stay on ISS will be only slightly shorter than the all-time NASA record for longest spaceflight.In 2016, NASA astronaut Scott Kelly returned to Earth after 340 days in space.NASA astronaut Andrew Morgan, who is scheduled to join Koch on the space station in July, is also set for an extended stay.The prolonged spaceflights for Koch and Morgan will help scientists better understand the effects of extended exposure to microgravity on human physiology.Researchers at NASA continue to work to understand how the body responds to its time in space, as well as determine how best to protect against and remedy any ill effects."Astronauts demonstrate amazing resilience and adaptability in response to long duration spaceflight exposure," Jennifer Fogarty, chief scientist of the Human Research Program at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, said in a news release.Scientists with the Human Research Program can use what they learn from astronauts aboard the space station to prepare astronauts to future missions to the moon and Mars.
Researchers restore functions to pig brains hours after death:::::When researchers connected the vasculature of a dead pig's brain to a specially designed solution, they were able to restore some cellular and neuronal functions.Photo by Stefano G. Daniele & Zvonimir Vrselja; Sestan Laboratory; Yale School of Medicine April 17 (UPI) -- Using a solution created to preserve brain tissue and an artificial circulatory system called BrainEx, scientists at the Yale School of Medicine were able to restore some basic cellular functions inside several pigs' brains hours after death.The breakthrough is the latest evidence of cellular resiliency in postmortem tissue.Last year, scientists observed cells continuing to express genes up to 48 hours after death.The latest study suggests a variety of brain functions thought to end within seconds of death -- as a result of a lack of blood and oxygen -- can actually be restored hours later."The intact brain of a large mammal retains a previously underappreciated capacity for restoration of circulation and certain molecular and cellular activities multiple hours after circulatory arrest," Nenad Sestan, professor of neuroscience, comparative medicine, genetics and psychiatry at Yale, said in a news release.RELATED New microscopy method promises better picture of deep brain activity During various lab tests, researchers regularly noticed that small brain tissues showed signs of cellular viability several hours postmortem.To find out whether this viability was widespread within a mammalian brain, scientists secured 32 pig heads from a meat-packing plant and hooked up each brain's vasculature system to their BrainEx circuitry and special solution.In addition to preserving neural cell integrity, the solution restored some neuronal, glial and vascular cell functionality inside the pig's brain.Researchers hope their BrainEx system -- detailed Wednesday in the journal Nature -- can help scientists study cellular functionality inside intact large mammalian brains."Previously, we have only been able to study cells in the large mammalian brain under static or largely two-dimensional conditions utilizing small tissue samples outside of their native environment," said Stefano G. Daniele, an M.D.and Ph.D. candidate at Yale."For the first time, we are able to investigate the large brain in three dimensions, which increases our ability to study complex cellular interactions and connectivity."Though some cellular and neuronal functions were restored, no electrical activity -- the kind associated with perception, awareness or consciousness -- was recorded.Scientists acknowledged that future studies involving brain restoration attempts should happen under strict ethical oversight."Restoration of consciousness was never a goal of this research," said Stephen Latham, director of Yale's Interdisciplinary Center for Bioethics."The researchers were prepared to intervene with the use of anesthetics and temperature-reduction to stop organized global electrical activity if it were to emerge.Everyone agreed in advance that experiments involving revived global activity couldn't go forward without clear ethical standards and institutional oversight mechanisms."RELATED New device allows scientists to precisely control neurons with light In a commentary accompanying the paper in Nature, scientists predicted additional brain resuscitation breakthroughs would make attempts "to restore people's brains might seem increasingly reasonable."But new opportunities to restore brain function will present new and difficult decisions for physicians, patients and patient advocates -- specifically, the decision of when to stop trying to save someone's life and start trying to save their organs for transplantation."The transplant community, neuroscientists, emergency medical personnel and other stakeholders must debate the issues," researchers wrote.

Scientists find the ghost of a new mineral:::::When scientists examined monazite samples from two ancient meteorite craters under a microscope, they found the ghostly signatures of a new type of mineral.Photo by Curtin University April 17 (UPI) -- Researchers have identified the "ghosts" of a new mineral at a pair of ancient meteorite impact sites.The mineral is a new type of monazite, which only forms under the high-pressure conditions created by meteorite impacts.Scientists found the new mineral after examining rock samples from impact craters in Germany and Canada.Researchers used an electron scanning microscope to study the tiny rock fragments."We found microscopic evidence that monazite, a rare earth element phosphate, transformed to another crystal structure under high pressure from a shockwave, similar to how graphite can turn into diamond under pressure," Nick Timms, an associate professor of earth and planetary sciences at Curtin University in Australia, said in a news release.Interestingly, the new mineral form didn't last.It came and went.But Timms and his colleagues were able to see the mineral's ghostly signature."The mineral reverted to its original crystal structure instead of maintaining this new structural form, and while the new mineral only existed for fractions of a second as the shockwave passed through the Earth close to ground zero, it left unique crystallographic clues to its existence," Timms said.Timms suggests it's possible scientists will never directly observe the new mineral."The mineral is not stable at the Earth's surface and readily transforms back to monazite again," he said."Therefore, we have really only seen, and will probably only ever see, its 'ghost.'"Researchers described their ghostly discovery this week in the journal Geology.
Solar evaporator to enable cheaper small-scale desalination technology:::::Scientists made a desalination component out of basswood.Photo by John T. Consoli/University of Maryland April 17 (UPI) -- The development of a new type of solar evaporator promises to power a new generation of cheaper and more efficient small-scale desalination technology.Roughly a billion people are without access to clean water.Desalination can help turn salt water into potable fresh water, but for many water-starved people and places, the technology is both impractical and prohibitively expensive.Thankfully, engineers at the University of Maryland have created a cheaper, more efficient evaporator, a critical component for cost-effective desalination.The wooden evaporator uses interfacial evaporation to generate steam with the energy of the sun.The component is inexpensive, eco-friendly, portable and efficient.RELATED Stanford scientists turn seawater into hydrogen fuel "These features make it suitable for off-grid water generation and purification, especially for low-income countries," Liangbing Hu, associate professor of materials science and engineering, said in a news release.Interfacial vaporators work by absorbing heat from above and pulling salt water up from below.Water evaporates from atop the thin, floating layers, leaving salt behind.Scientists built their evaporator of thin layers of basswood, which boasts tiny channels that carry water and nutrients up the tree trunk.Researchers drilled additional millimeter-wide channels.To encourage absorption of solar energy, scientists carbonized the top of the wooden layer using high heat.RELATED Scientists prevent supercooled water from freezing The tiny channels in the basswood help draw up saltwater, as well as return salt to the solution below after the water on top evaporates.The wood is also self-cleaning.Their creation showed great promise in lab tests."In the lab, we have successfully demonstrated excellent anti-fouling in a wide range of salt concentrations, with stable steam generation with about 75 percent efficiency," said lead researcher Yudi Kuang.Scientists described their invention this week in the journal Advance Materials.Researchers are now working to pair the evaporator with a steam condenser in order to create a working desalination device.
Bacteria use viruses to differentiate themselves from their competitors:::::The photo shows a virus particle carried by some bacteria strains.The phage allows the bacteria to recognize itself and gain a competitive advantage over its competitors.Photo by Sooyeon Song and Missy Hazen April 16 (UPI) -- Normally, bacteria and viruses are enemies, but new research suggests a viral infection can offer bacteria some benefits -- chiefly, the ability to distinguish friend from foe."This is the first evidence that cells can distinguish themselves from related competitors through the use of a virus," Thomas Wood, researcher at Pennsylvania State University, said in a news release."The implications are that we should re-evaluate the relationship between a virus and its cellular host in that there are sometimes benefits to having a viral infection."Scientists discovered the phenomenon after observing a stark demarcation line between two strains of the bacteria Escherichia coli K-12, but no such divide between identical clones.The related rivals steered clear of one another, while the identical strains swam toward one another.To find out why, scientists surveyed 4,296 single-gene knockouts in the genome of Escherichia coli K-12.Researchers determined only one mutation caused the demarcation line to disappear.The mutation involved a gene that is used in viral replication.According to their analysis, the virus-related proteins produced by the gene allow for bacterial self-recognition.Scientists were also able erase the demarcation line by silencing the bacteriophage genomes that have weaved their way into the bacteria's genome.These leftover viral genes don't produce active phage particles, nor do they rupture host cells.When scientists exposed bacteria to a related virus, the old viral genes were activated and began producing phage particles for the new virus.The latest findings -- published Tuesday in the journal Cell Reports -- suggest the newborn particles help bacteria distinguish itself from closely related competitors.The new virus and old viral genes allow bacteria to organize into groups.Their power in numbers allows the bacteria to bully competitors."Bacteria are frequently thought of as living individually, but in fact they can forage for food as groups," Wood said."In order to act as a group, they must be able to distinguish themselves from other bacteria.In one type of social activity, when they communicate, bacterial cells secrete chemical signals to communicate.Now we show cells utilize viruses to distinguish themselves from closely related bacteria."Experiments showed the virus doesn't attack its host cells.Instead, the virus attacks other bacteria cells that don't carry the virus.The host helps the virus reproduce, and the virus takes out the bacteria's competitors.
Astronomers confirm third planet in binary star system:::::Astronomers found the third planet of the Kepler-47 system, the biggest of the three, orbiting in between the two previously discovered exoplanets.Photo by NASA/JPLCaltech/T.Pyle April 16 (UPI) -- Astronomers have identified a third exoplanet orbiting the binary star system Kepler-47.With three planets and two suns, Kepler-47 is the only known binary star system with multiple planets.Proof that binary star systems can host multiple planets is significant because binary stars are much more common than solo stars like the sun.The new discovery was published this week in the Astronomical Journal.Scientists previously observed the transits of two planets circling the stellar duo in Kepler-47, but the third planet's transit signal was weak, making it hard to spot.When researchers surveyed new data collected by NASA's Kepler space telescope, they were able to isolate the dimming caused by the third exoplanet's orbital path across the face of the binary stars."We saw a hint of a third planet back in 2012, but with only one transit we needed more data to be sure," lead study author Jerome Orosz, an astronomer at San Diego State University, said in a news release."With an additional transit, the planet's orbital period could be determined, and we were then able to uncover more transits that were hidden in the noise in the earlier data."Astronomers estimate that the orbital plane of the newly discovered third planet, Kepler-47d, became more aligned with Earth and its two suns, increasing the strength of its transit signal.Surprisingly, the new transit data suggests the third exoplanet, which orbits the two suns in between the other two exoplanets, is the largest of the three -- roughly between the sizes of Neptune and Saturn.All the planets in the Kepler-47 system boast surprisingly low densities, and neither the suns or the planets are particularly hot.All of the members of the Kepler-47 system enjoy intimate orbits.The two suns orbit one another every 7.45 days, and the entire system could fit within the orbit of the Earth.
DNA suggests Stonehenge builders came from Anatolia:::::The Neolithic farmers that built Stonehenge were the descendants of Mediterranean farmers.Photo by EPA-EFE/FACUNDO ARRIZABALAGA April 16 (UPI) -- The people who built Stonehenge and brought farming to Britain came from the Mediterranean.According to a new survey of DNA extracted from ancient human remains, Neolithic farmers began migrating out of Anatolia, modern Turkey, several thousand years ago.Some went north, following the Danube.Another group traveled west across the Mediterranean, arriving in Britain around 6,000 years ago.When scientists analyzed DNA from the remains of early British farmers, they found they were most closely related to early farmers in Iberia, modern day Spain and Portugal.The genetic data showed the Iberian farmers hailed from the Mediterranean.Dozens of archaeological studies have detailed the spread of farming and new cultural practices, including new more sophisticated pottery traditions, across Europe.But scientists weren't sure whether new traditions arrived with new people, or reflected the spread of ideas.The latest genetic study suggests migrating farmers brought their traditions with them."As soon as these Neolithic cultures start to arrive, we see a big change in the ancestry of the British population," Tom Booth, a postdoctoral researcher at the Natural History Museum in London, said in a news release."It looks like the development of farming and these Neolithic cultures was mainly driven by the migration of people from mainland Europe."In Britain, as well as the rest of Europe, Neolithic farmers encountered groups of hunter-gatherers.But the newcomers didn't wipe out the locals."As this Neolithic population moved west, we can track cumulatively increasing levels of the local hunter-gatherer signatures in the genetics," said Booth."So this wasn't just one population wiping the other out.Instead, they were mixing."Still, around 6,000 years ago, Britain's genome became dominated by the genetic signatures of Mediterranean farmers.Scientists estimate Britain's hunter-gatherer population was too small to maintain a significant influence on the population's genome.In addition to bringing new ways of subsisting and new types of pottery, the Neolithic farmers also brought the tradition of building stone monuments.Their arrival preceded the construction of Stonehenge.RELATED New branches of the Denisovan family tree discovered in Indonesia Scientists shared their analysis of Neolithic DNA this week in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution.
Airborne microplastic particles found falling on remote mountain peaks:::::April 16 (UPI) -- Microplastics are everywhere.The tiny plastic particles have made their way to Earth's poles, to the bottom of the deepest ocean trenches and now to the peaks of French mountains.Scientists have measured windblown microplastic particles in a remote part of the Pyrenees mountain range in France.The discovery was detailed in a study published this week in the journal Nature Geoscience.For five months, researchers collected particles settling out of the atmosphere and into a 10 square foot collection device at the Bernadouze meteorological station in the Pyrenees.The device captured an average of 365 plastic particles each day.If microplastics fall across the rest of the country at the same rate they settle from the sky at the top of the Pyrenees, France is blanketed by 2,000 tons of plastic particles every year.RELATED Dead whale found with 88 pounds of plastic in stomach in the Philippines "It's astounding and worrying that so many particles were found in the Pyrenees field site," Steve Allen, a doctoral student at the University of Strathclyde in England, said in a news release."What we can unequivocally prove is that it's being transported there by the wind.""It opens up the possibility that it's not only in the cities are you breathing this in, but it can travel quite some distance from the sources," said Allen, who is also a researcher at EcoLab in Toulouse, France."Plastic litter is an increasing global issue and one of the key environmental challenges we face on global scale."The meteorological station where scientists collected particle samples is located in a remote part of the Pyrenees thought to be pristine.It is 75 miles from the nearest city.RELATED Scientists in Britain found microplastics in every marine mammal they examined "This mountainous area has been the subject of numerous interdisciplinary studies in ecology and environment over the past decade but we would still never have anticipated that this latest study would reveal such high levels of microplastics deposits," said Gael Le Roux from EcoLab.Because the Pyrenees are covered in snow for most of the year, it's unlikely the microplastics arrived by way of local transport.They weren't simply blown from a nearby park.Instead, they were likely sourced from far away.Scientists have previously found microplastics in Antarctica, as well as in the planet's deepest ocean trench.Studies have confirmed that deep sea creatures, as well as marine mammals, are ingesting significant quantities of microplastics.RELATED Even deep sea creatures are eating plastic Now, scientists know microplastics are being carried to extreme heights, as well.The tiny plastic particles can be ingested and inhaled by humans.And as revealed by earlier studies, the ingestion of microplastics can trigger health and behavioral changes in mice and fish.
Meteor strikes eject water from lunar surface:::::An artistic rendering shows a meteoroid impact release a puff of water vapor into the lunar atmosphere.Photo by NASA/Goddard/Conceptual Image Lab April 15 (UPI) -- The small space rocks that regularly pepper the moon are squeezing water from the lunar surface, perfuming the thin lunar atmosphere with ephemeral vapors.Computer models previously predicted streams of meteoroids ejecting water from the moon's surface, but until now, the phenomenon hadn't been directly observed.When scientists surveyed data collected by NASA's Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer, a lunar orbiter, they were able to connect brief spikes in atmospheric water vapor levels with meteoroid streams."We traced most of these events to known meteoroid streams, but the really surprising part is that we also found evidence of four meteoroid streams that were previously undiscovered," Mehdi Benna, scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a news release.RELATED Billionaire plans second mission to the moon for Israel Benna and his colleagues described their discovery this week in the journal Nature Geoscience.Scientists have previously found evidence of water inside the moon.Researchers have mapped the presence of water in the lunar soil, as well as captured images of ice on the surface of the lunar poles.Hydroxyl, a highly reactive relative of H2O, is also present on the moon.The science of how water got to the moon and how much there is, however, remains unsettled.What water is present on the moon mostly remains locked up in ice form and trapped underground.As a result, the lunar atmosphere is usually without water vapor.The LADEE data, however, showed tiny impacts can briefly free up some of the moon's water."When the moon passed through one of these meteoroid streams, enough vapor was ejected for us to detect it," said Richard Elphic, the LADEE project scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center."And then, when the event was over, the H2O or OH went away."The lunar surface is dry, but scientists predict a layer of hydrated sediment lies just beneath the surface.To free up the buried water, researchers estimated the meteoroid stream would have to penetrate at least three inches.As the moon passes through a meteoroid stream, the tiny impacts generate shock waves that expel puffs of vapor into the lunar atmosphere, or exosphere, the thin envelope of gas that surrounds the satellite."We know that some of the water must be coming from the Moon, because the mass of water being released is greater than the water mass within the meteoroids coming in," said Dana Hurley, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.NASA scientists hope future lunar missions will uncover new details about the ratio of H20 to OH, as well as offer insights into the origins of the moon's ancient water reserves.
Hurricane Aftermath Leaves Florida with Years of Major Wildfire Threat:::::The surging seas and vicious winds that Hurricane Michael unleashed on the Florida Panhandle last October have long since died down.Yet the scars left by the strongest storm ever to strike the region have ramped up the risk of another type of natural disaster for years to come: across millions of acres of forest stretching into southern Georgia, the carcasses of pine treessnapped like matchsticks by the storms windspose a major wildfire threat.Ive never seen anything like this, says Kevin Hiers, a fire scientist at Tall Timbers Research Station in Tallahassee, after surveying the vast swaths of downed timber.As Florida enters this years dry season, one blaze has already broken out in Panama City, which is in the northwestern part of the state and still recovering from the storm.A minor fire that started in yard debris got into the fallen timber and grew overnight into a 600-acre-plus blaze that forced about two dozen homes to evacuate.Officials are working to reduce the threat of further fires, but are hamstrung by the huge numbers of downed trees and limited funding.And the problem is unfolding against a backdrop of rising temperatures, which are changing the conditions that affect wildfires in the region and posing challenges to existing disaster mitigation strategies.We have to take this climate crisis seriously, and do more on prevention before disaster and recovery after, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried said in a statement.Id Be Really Worried The core of the tree damage covers 350,000 acres of Florida forest that were completely destroyed, leaving a tinderbox of 100 tons of dead wood an acre.That is more than 10 times the amount of fallen leaves and limbs that accumulate in a normal year without a storm, Hiers says.An additional 4.6 million acres sustained lesser, but still worrisome, damage.With the rainy season ending, Florida State Forester Jim Karels warned in March that the region could see intense blazes similar to the West, if we dont get rid of the debris.But the extent of the damage makes that difficult to do quickly.Even heavy bulldozers struggle to get through the thickets of snapped trees to clear debris.Forest managers have started controlled burns, but covering the total acreage affected by Michael could take years.So far, the federal government has not provided extra money to supplement these efforts.At the current pace, Hiers estimates a full cleanup could take 10 years or more.If I was a fire manager or land manager Id be really worried, says Mike Flannigan, a wildfire researcher at the University of Alberta.If you do get a fire, its going to be extremely hard to put it out, because theres so much fuel there.Crews were able to contain the fire near Panama City, and some rain later that week helped.But soon drier summer weather will arrivealong with more lightning, which can ignite new blazes.Harbinger of Things to Come?Southeastern wildfires present different challenges from the conflagrations that have long routinely plagued the West.Most forested land in the Southeast is in smaller, privately owned parcels, meaning there are more people and structures in harms way compared with the huge tracts of uninhabitated federal land in the West.For decades the Southeast has mitigated the threat by maintaining aggressive controlled burn programs, even when such measures fell out of favor in other regions.These programs have reduced the risk of large, intense fires, because normal debris on the forest floor is burned away instead of building up year after year.Controlled burnsalong with clearing debris and warning the public of fire dangershelped prevent major wildfire damage after Hurricane Hugo wiped out forested areas in South Carolina in 1989, says Carly Phillips, an expert on climate and energy with the Union of Concerned Scientists.But that was 1989, she saysnow there are all these other kinds of compounding factors from climate change.It is still uncertain how some of those factors (such as rain patterns over Florida) might change, but it is clear from climate models that temperatures have and will continue to rise in all seasons across the Southeast.That means future droughts are very likely to be longer and more intense than todays; this increases wildfire risks, according to the Fourth National Climate Assessment published in 2018, to which Hiers contributed.As the atmosphere warms, the ability to suck moisture out of dead fuel increases almost exponentially, Flannigan says.The drier the fuels are, the easier it is for fires to start, to spread, and to burn more intensely.Pines and vegetation in the Southeast are naturally resistant to low-intensity fires, but trees cannot survive burns that go all the way up to their crowns.High-intensity fires just race across the landscape until the weather changes or the fuel changes, Flannigan says, and management options are limited at that scale.As for the ways climate change might alter the likelihood and intensity of hurricanes, scientists are still working that out.Yet Hiers worries that the intersection of hurricane damage and wildfire threats is a harbinger of things to comeand that Florida will not be ready.We know that the climate is changing already, he says.But we dont have good plans for how to really combat the inevitable, which is that another powerful storm like Hurricane Michael will someday hit the Southeast and leave huge fire threats behind.
Brain Restoration System Explores Hazy Territory between Being Dead or Alive:::::One of the two legal definitions of death is irreversible cessation of all brain function, commonly known as brain death.(The other is the halting of circulatory and respiratory function.)It was widely believed that brain cells undergo rapidand irreversibledegeneration immediately after death.But a striking new study, published Wednesday in Nature, suggests that much functionality can be preserved or restoredeven hours after death.A research team, based primarily at the Yale School of Medicine, managed to revive some functions in the whole brains of pigs slaughtered four hours previously and to sustain them for a further six hours.The work was motivated by the observation that cells can be harvested from postmortem brains and sustained in cell cultures for study, neuroscientist and team leader Nenad Sestan said in a press briefing: In short, if we can do this in a petri dish, can we do it in an intact brain?The system Sestan and his colleague developed, called BrainEx, comprises three elements: a computerized system of pumps, filters and reservoirs; a blood substitute containing no cells but capable of carrying oxygen, along with numerous compounds designed to protect cells; and a surgical procedure to hook everything up.The researchers compared brains they sustained using BrainEx with brains that were perfused with an inert fluid or that were not hooked up to anything to assess their relative states at different times.The system reduced cell death, preserved anatomical integrity, and restored circulatory, metabolic and some cellular functions.The team was even able to observe inflammatory responses from immune cells, called glia, by introducing a molecule that mimics bacterial infection.The findings suggest that cells are far more resilient to the damage caused by stopping blood flow, which deprives the brain of oxygen (known as ischemia), than previously appreciated.We didnt have any a priori hypothesis that wed be able to restore cells to this level, Sestan told journalists.We were really surprised.This work could represent a major contribution to methods available for studying the brain.The research was funded under the National Institutes of Healths BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Initiative, and NIH experts also briefed the press.This is a real breakthrough for brain research; its a new tool that bridges the gap between basic neuroscience and clinical research, said Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, a BRAIN Initiative team leader at the National Institute of Mental Health.It provides experimental access like weve never had before; we anticipate interesting studies on brain circulation, cell metabolism, other cell biology and mapping long-range connections.The immediate findings have implications for how we understand brain death.Its drilled into us as scientists and doctors that after even just a couple of minutes, theres no going back; this clearly turns that on its head, says Madeline Lancaster, an expert in research on brain organoids (so-called mini brains grown from stem cellsat the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the work.Where I see the most potential in the short term is just changing thinking about that and hopefully spurring people to do more research into humans who are potentially brain deadand understanding how we might be able to bring them back.Extending the time before declaration of brain death has other implicationsit could delay when organs could become available for donations, as discussed in a commentary article in Nature.One near-term benefit is the opportunity to learn more about ischemic injury.We hope to better understand how brain cells react to circulatory arrest and if we can intervene and salvage these cells, Sestan said.By doing this, we can possibly come up with better therapies for stroke and other disorders that cause brain cells to die.In the longer term, the system could provide a powerful method for studying brain connectivity, circuit function and disease processes.A certain amount can already be learned using brain slices, brain organoids (so-called mini-brains grown from stem cells) and postmortem brains, but this system offers at least two advantages: First, an intact brain offers an unparalleled opportunity to study brain circuitry.If the question is one where you really need the context of the whole organ, this definitely gives you an advantage, Lancaster says.If we knew [brain circuits] were functional to some degree, being able to look at a fully intact circuit would be very powerful.Second, postmortem studies limit observations to discrete points in time, which curbs understanding of how diseases progress.For instance, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers are thought, by some, to involve toxic proteins spreading in the brain.You could do a lot more here in terms of perturbing the brain in various ways: introducing a prion protein, or amyloid-beta, for example, and looking at spreading, Lancaster says.Being able to see it in real time is really key.This would be a way to do that.The team engaged with existing ethics frameworks from the time it began to plan the experiments.Chief among the ethics concerns is whether resuscitated brains might exhibit signs of consciousness.The study specifically wanted to avoid the remote possibility that consciousness would return, and the researchers were prepared to lower temperatures and deploy anesthetics to extinguish such signs if they emerged.They continually monitored electrical recordings from the brains surface and saw no evidence of the global electrical activity that would be expected if there was anything approaching cognition.Im very confident no consciousness was present in these restored brains, says Christof Koch of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, a leading researcher in the neuroscience of consciousness.There were none of the signals we associate with consciousness, or even sleep, Koch says: Only a flat line, implying a complete absence of any sort of consciousness.But part of the reason for the lack of electrical activity may relate to the fact that the perfusion solution contained neural activity blockers.The researchers included these blockers because they wanted to keep the brains quiescent to maximize cellular recovery.An active brain would require a massively greater energy supply, and the very act of firing can damage neurons (a phenomenon known as excitotoxicity).The team took tissue samples to show that individual neurons were still electrically functional, which necessarily involved washing out the solution to prepare the samples for electrophysiological recordings.But what would have happened if these blockers were not used?We cannot speak with any scientific certainty to that point, since we didnt run those experiments, Stefano Daniele, co-lead author of the study, told journalists.If such future experiments were to move resuscitated brains closer to conscious activity, that would spur discussions about what can be considered truly dead.These considerations are discussed in another accompanying commentary article co-authored by legal scholar Nita Farahany, a bioethicist who is a member of the Neuroethics Working Group at the BRAIN Initiative and who the researchers consulted from an early stage.The team also consulted the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Yale, and the members were told the study was not subject to animal welfare-protection guidelines.Most obviously, the pigs were already dead: the researchers procured the brains from a pork processing plant, so no animal was sacrificed for this research.In any case, such guidelines do not apply to animals raised for food.Moving forward, the work must be replicated by other labs that will have to learn the intricacies of the manually operated system.The team itself wants to establish how long brains can be sustained this way.The perfusion stage of the experiment only lasted six hours because at that point, the control brains that were not in the BrainEx system had undergone too much disintegration for meaningful comparisons to be made.If brains can be kept going for long periods, and researchers turn from prioritizing cellular recovery to reviving electrical function in situ, that would enter uncharted ethical territory.There are some questions that need to be answered first, Farahany says.Can we ever get EEG [electroencephalogram] recovery?What are the limits to it if we ever get to that?And what are the implications, then, for animal research and for human research one day?In Farahanys view, these unknowns put what was initially considered dead tissue into a new ethical category.Its the potential [for greater recovery] that creates a moral status thats different and requires that we treat it differently, Farahany says.One could go with the safest possible approach there, which is to give it some or similar protections that would be accorded to animal research subjects.Such an experiment would likely be first tried in rodents, initially by just removing the chemicals that block electrical activity.If anything that looked remotely like conscious activity were to be detected, we would be in territory for which new ethical guidelines would be needed.At that point, if you start thinking about it more like a living animal, then minimizing any risk of pain or distress would be appropriate, Farahany says.The problem is: right now, we think of this as tissue research and it's no longer just clearly dead.Its just not exactly alive either.

Pain Patients Get Relief from War on Opioids:::::Ever since U.S. health authorities began cracking down on opioid prescriptions about five years ago, one vulnerable group has suffered serious collateral damage: the approximately 18 million Americans who have been taking opioids to manage their chronic pain.Pain specialists report that desperate patients are showing up in their offices, after being told by their regular physician, pharmacy or insurer that they can no longer receive the drugs or must shift to lower doses, no matter how severe their condition.Abrupt changes in dosage can destabilize patients who have relied for many years on opioids, and the consequences can be dire, says Stefan Kertesz, an expert on opioids and addiction at the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine.Ive seen deaths from suicide and medical deterioration after opioids are cut.Last week, after roughly three years of intensive lobbying and alarming reports from the chronic pain community, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) took separate actions to tell clinicians that it is dangerous to abruptly curtail opioids for patients who have taken them longterm for pain.The FDA did so by requiring changes to opioid labels specifically warning about the risks of sudden and involuntary dose tapering.The agency cited reports of "serious withdrawal symptoms, uncontrolled pain, psychological distress, and suicide" among patients who have been inappropriately cut off from the painkillers.One day later, CDC director Robert Redfield issued a clarification of the centers 2016 Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, which includes cautions about prescribing doses above specific thresholds.Redfields letter emphasized that these thresholds were not intended for patients already taking high doses for chronic pain but were meant to guide first-time opioid prescriptions.The letter follows another recent clarification sent by the CDC to oncology and hematology groups, emphasizing that cancer patients and sickle cell patients were largely exempt from the guideline.Taken together, these actions represent a significant victory for the chronic pain community.The combination of the FDA and CDC speaking out reconfigures the conversation going forward in a very, very helpful way, says Kertesz, who was one of five doctors associated with the advocacy group Health Professionals for Patients in Pain (HP3) who received Redfields letter.Tougher rules on opioid prescriptions from federal and state authorities, health insurance companies and pharmacies, were an understandable response to the nations opioid crisis, an epidemic of abuse and overdose that led to a 345 percent spike in U.S. deaths related to legal and illicit opioids between 2001 and 2016.Since 2016, most fatal overdoses have involved illegally produced fentanyl sold on the street, according to CDC data, but past research has shown that many victims got started with a prescription opioid such as oxycodone.The CDCs 2016 guideline was aimed at reining in irresponsible prescribing practices.(The agencys own analysis showed that prescriptions for opioids had quadrupled between 1999 and 2010.)The guideline stressed that the first-line treatments for chronic pain are non-opioid medications and non-drug approaches such as physical therapy.When resorting to opioids, the guideline urged doctors to prescribe the lowest effective dosage, to carefully size up risks versus benefits when raising doses above 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) a day, and to carefully justify a decision to go to 90 MME or above.That advice on dosage was widely misinterpreted as a hard limit for all patients.Kertesz has collected multiple examples of letters from pharmacies, medical practices and insurers that incorrectly cite the guideline as a reason to cut off long-term opioid patients.Frank Gawin, a retired psychiatrist in Hawaii, is one of many chronic pain sufferers ensnared by that kind of mistake.For 20 years he took high-dose opioids (about 400 MME daily) to manage extreme pain from complications of Lyme Disease.Gawin, an expert on addiction himself, was well aware of the risks but notes that he stayed on the same dose throughout those 20 years.It helped me profoundly and probably extended my career by 10 to 15 years, he says.About five months ago, his doctor, a pain specialist he prefers not to name, informed Gawin and other patients that she would be tapering everyone below 80 MMEs because she was concerned about running afoul of medical authorities.Gawin has not yet reached that goal, but his symptoms have already returned with a vengeance.As I am talking to you, I am in pain, he said in a phone interview.Im having trouble concentrating.Im depleted.Im not myself.Last weeks federal actions could go a long way in informing physicians not to cut off patients like Gawin.Of particular value, say patient advocates and experts, is the emphasis on working together with patients on any plan to taper the drugs.Its finally about patient consent, says Andrea Anderson, former executive director of the Alliance for the Treatment of Intractable Pain, an advocacy group.She notes that the FDA urged doctors to create an individualized plan for patients who do wish to taper and that the agency stated that No standard opioid tapering schedule exists that is suitable for all patients.The CDC is relying on pain advocacy groups to get the word out about its clarification.Any formal update to the guideline will await the results of a systematic review of chronic pain research currently underway, said Debbie Dowell, chief medical officer of the CDCs Injury Center, in an email; Dowell is the lead author of the 2016 guideline.Gawin hopes the federal actions will persuade his doctor that forced tapering is wrong for him.The only way I can see getting back to normal, he says, is to get back to the medication that worked for me.[Editor's note: Andrea Anderson has stepped down from her position, and this story was updated on April 19, 2019, to reflect that change.]
Scientists Uncover California’s Hidden Earthquakes:::::Every 174 seconds the ground in Southern California trembles as Earths tectonic plates shudder past one another.That amounts to 495 earthquakes every day, according to a new analysis of seismic data that isolated the very weakest measurable tremors in a region famous for its seismic jitters.The new study, published this week in Science, adds nearly two million earthquakes to the catalogue of total seismic events in Southern California over the past decade.Although the newly known quakes were imperceptible to humans, the findings help fill gaps in the earthquake record, shedding light on the geophysical processes that lead to the dreaded Big Ones.Scientists have long understood that earthquakes increase in number as they decrease in strength.But cataloguing those tiny tremblers is tricky.Their signals are often hidden within the general noise that seismometers pick upincluding the shaking caused by construction, passing trains and even air traffic.That means the majority of earthquakes have long been hidden from science.But 15 years ago, scientists noticed a pattern that enabled them to find these cloaked quakes: If two earthquakes originate in the same place, the shapes of their seismic waves are almost identical from the vantage point of a single seismometer.If one waveform zigs or zags, the other will follow suiteven if their magnitudes are vastly different.And that is key: If one knows the precise waveform of a quake, it is easier to find it within the noise.This means the signals of big quakes can be used to identify other, much tinier tremblings that travel along the same path.This method is computationally intensive, however, so in the past scientists had only ever attempted to use it on relatively small data sets spanning days or weeks.But this did not deter Zachary Ross, a scientist at the California Institute of Technology, and his colleagues.The team had a loftier goal in mind: they wanted to scour the Southern California Seismic Networks archivewhich includes data from 500 stations that have constantly monitored the ground over the last 10 yearsin search of previously overlooked earthquakes.The extensive search took 90 days worth of computing time.By the end the team identified nearly two million additional earthquakes that had occurred between 2008 and 2017a tenfold increase over the original catalogue.That alone might not be that exciting, but [the study authors] demonstrate how those additional detections of really small earthquakes do tell us more about how faults work, says Roland Burgmann, a geophysicist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the new research.That makes it a beautiful study.For one thing, Ross and his colleagues discovered a number of earthquakes that were clustered together in time and space.Everything seems to be related to some degree, Ross says.Take the El MayorCucapah earthquake that occurred on Easter Sunday in 2010 as an example: The shock originated in northern Mexico but triggered a series of smaller shudders within Southern Californiasome up to 275 kilometers from the epicenter of the initial earthquake.It is well known that large temblors can set off smaller ones, called aftershocks, and indeed scientists had already spotted such aftershocks associated with the 2010 eventbut not at such great distances.So, the new study extends the known reach of earthquakes, Burgmann says, as well as shedding light on how that triggering works.Near an earthquake epicenter, aftershocks are brought about by the added stress resulting from the rearrangement of the Earths crust.But farther away from the epicenter, aftershocks are touched off by the shaking itself.The study results thus suggest that the latter might play a more significant role than previously expecteda crucial finding that will help scientists better forecast the likelihood of aftershocks on various faults in the future.If those faults contain the potential to unleash catastrophic events, the aftershocks will only help prime the fault for a Big One.As such, a better forecast could help save lives.The team also revealed a number of minuscule foreshocksan equally important finding, given that scientists do not yet understand the details of how earthquakes get going.One idea scientists have floated is that a small section of a fault starts to slip slowly before picking up speedand that this creates a series of shocks that gradually increase in strength over time and culminate in the main earthquake.Another idea is that a tiny rupture in one fault creates a cascade of shocks that travel along that fault (or a number of interconnected faults) like a set of dominoes as one event triggers the next, which triggers the next, until the main shock event is suddenly unleashed.Without better data on foreshocks it has been hard to determine which hypothesis is correct, so the new results might be a game-changer.For example, in the Brawley earthquake swarm that occurred in California in 2012, 10 earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.0 struck the desert over the course of three days.Although they appeared at the time to initiate quite suddenly, Ross and his colleagues were able to show that the onset was more gradual, with several minor earthquakes preceding the major ones.That hints the swarm might have been caused by the first scenario (i.e., a slow creep), says co-author Daniel Trugman at the Los Alamos National Lab.Although Trugman notes that the hints the study gleaned on how foreshocks work are far from definitive, he is confident the new data set will allow scientists to better understand what precisely kicks an earthquake into high gear.And that may one day help scientists forecast earthquakes.If we could really predict when the next big earthquake will occur, were in businessthats the Holy Grail in seismic hazard analysis, Trugman says.I definitely wouldn't say we're there yet, but it's this type of work that's going to hopefully push us forward.Either way, Greg Beroza, a Stanford University seismologist who was not involved in the study, suspects that the most interesting findings are yet to come.He is excited to pour through the new catalogue in search of as-yet unknown phenomenaand there should be many.Its just like if a new telescope comes along and its magnification is 10 times greater, Burgmann says.Suddenly we see all of these stars and planets that previously we didn't see.
A Genetic Risk Score Tries to Predict Whether a Child Will Become Obese:::::We all have that friend who survives on beer and barbecue and somehow stays slim.Our weightthough of course influenced by factors such as diet and exercisecan be frustratingly genetic.Scads of gene variants, differences in single letters of the genetic code, have been associated with being overweight.Researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute have now developed a scoring system they believe can reliably predict peoples obesity risk through life based on their genome.The study behind the scales development was published April 18 in the journal Cell.The possibility of administering a routine test, the authors contend, could help destigmatize obesity as stemming from lack of willpower; all the while urging those at higher obesity risk to pay extra mind to overcoming their biological blueprint.To develop their risk scoring system, the research team analyzed data from the largest genome wide association study (GWAS) in obesity, compiled by another research group in 2015.A GWAS entails scanning an entire genome for particular gene variants associated with a particular trait or condition.The authors looked at over two million common gene variants in over 300,000 people in the study, ranging from newborns to middle-aged adults.A computer algorithm then crunched the numbers to come up with a polygenic obesity risk score that predicted someones BMI, a score based on the collective influence of multiple genes.Such genetic risk scores are being studied in a host of chronic conditions beyond just obesity.The new GWAS confirms what many have assumed: certain people gain weight because they are biologically more destined by their genes than others to develop obesity.The 10 percent of people in the study with the highest risk scores were on average 29 pounds heavier than the group in the lowest decile.The elevated scorers were 25 times more likely to develop severe obesity than the bottom 10 percent.Whats more, the risk score had a negligible correlation with birth weight, suggesting that a chunky baby doesnt necessarily mean an overweight adult, and vice versa.The correlation between genetic risk and weight becomes apparent sometime around toddlerdom.We expected to a see a link between the score and weight outcomes, says Amit Khera, the studys first author.But we were surprised by the impact of the genetic predisposition had already started to emerge by the time children enroll in preschool.Whereas the traditional approaches to exploring genetic causes of obesity often focused on single genetic mutations, Khera explains that on an individual basis these mutations are quite uncommon, even in the most severely affected people.Here we show that its is not one mutationbut the cumulative effect of many variantsthat translates into increased risk.Genes, however, are not the whole story.In the past few decades obesity rates have soared beyond what could be explained by genes.Since 1980, obesity prevalence has more than doubled in American adults.In kids and adolescents, rates have tripled.Lets face it, obesity is somewhere around 50 percent due to genetic factors that determine someones innate predisposition to gain weight, says Ruth Loos, a professor of environmental medicine and public health at Mount Sinais Icahn School of Medicine in New York City.However, the other 50 percent is due to environmental factors, such as lifestyle, diet and physical activity.I am concerned that the authors may have oversold the genetic score and that their claims of prediction are too bold.The relatively recent surge in obesity rates has been attributed to our cultures obesogenic environment: highly processed, high-calorie foods; an increasingly sedentary, digital workforce.The modern lifestyle has taken its toll on our physiques.Loos points out that while its an improvement over previous obesity scoring systems, the newly published method captures less than 10 percent of the genetic risk of obesity.With 90 percent of the information missing, its impossible to accurately predict obesity, she says.Cecile Janssens, a professor of translational epidemiology at Emory University in Atlanta, shares the skepticism, particularly since Khera hasnt yet specified any practical clinical applications of their scoring system.The authors dont ask about how the score could be used in practice, she says.Given that people dont get obese overnight and can see themselves get heavier when they look in the mirror or step on the scale, it seems that there are many more relevant targets for obesity prevention than a genetic score that only explains less than 10 percent of the variance in weight.Still, Khera feels that while he and his colleagues havent fully addressed how their findings could influence patient caresomething they plan to do with future research he suggests that the realization that severe obesity has a strong biological basis could help prevent stigmatization.He also posits that knowing your obesity risk at a young age could encourage earlier treatment and lifestyle interventions that could help overcomeat least partiallya genetic tendency toward carrying excess weight.DNA is not destiny, he says.We know a healthy lifestyle can offset a genetic predisposition, so a key goal is to empower people to prevent onset of disease.
How We Roll: Study Shows We're More Lone Wolves Than Team Players:::::What credo would you choose: Share and share alike?or To each his own?The choice doesnt relate only to material goods or socialism versus capitalism.It can also reflect attitudes about how we solve our collective problems, such as affordable access to health care or threats from climate change.Despite the existence of shared resources in our liveswater, air, land, tax dollarssome people will lean into a go-it-alone approach, with each individual deciding for themselves whats best.Others will look to group decision-making.Whats the tipping point for shifting from maverick to team player?Researchers at Leiden University, the Netherlands, addressed that question using a computer game in which students had to decide whether to use a set of virtual resources to solve a problem individually or collectively.The investigators found that these study participants had a remarkable tendency to waste resources for the sake of an independent solution rather than efficiently using what in the social sciences is referred to as the commons.The study results were published April 17 in Science Advances.The choice to follow the loner track even if it means wasted resources probably sounds familiar.Such useless waste, a tragedy of the commons, as the authors call it, is one that societies face in all kinds of situations.Study author Jrg Gross, assistant professor at Leiden Universitys Institute of Psychology, cites several examples of real-world problems from modern life that inspired the study, including use of public versus private transportation.After all, almost everyone needs to get from Location A to Location B.Rather than create universal public transit solutions, though, people more often turn to using private vehicles.The cultural aspect of these findings stands out, says Michael Varnum, assistant professor of psychology at Arizona State University, who was not involved in the study.That these students live in the Netherlands is interesting, he says, because Dutch society has a solid social safety net with good infrastructure, public health care and education.I would guess that the effects observed in the present studies might be more pronounced in societies that have greater levels of income inequality and less generous public benefits, such as the U.S. To observe these effects, Gross and co-author Carsten K.W.De Dreu, who is affiliated with both Leiden University and the University of Amsterdam, split up 160 participants into 40 groups of four people each.The groups faced a simulated problem that they could solve by committing sufficient resources to it individually or as a community.Participants, each given 100 resource points to start, could put their virtual resources into either a personal pool or a shared pool.After each round of play, the players could scrutinize what had accumulated in the community and their personal pools and how much others in their group had given up in each round.By a final round, the four players in each group had to have accumulated 160 points in the community pool.If the group failed to meet that goal, each individual had to have an accumulation of 40, 50, 60, 70 or 80 points (the researchers varied the individual requirement across games.If the group built up 160 points in the community pool, everyone got to keep the individual resources they had left.If the group didnt achieve the 160 points, whoever failed to meet the personal target set for the game (60 points, for example) also lost everything else.With four players per group, the most obvious and equitable solution to meeting the 160-point goal was to pony up 40 of the 100 individually allocated resource points to the community pot, keeping the rest (60 points) for themselves.Everyone wins something and keeps something (60 points), and no one loses everything.But if a player chose the individual route, all possible scenarios (40, 50, 60, 70 or 80 points) cost them as much or more than a contribution of 40 points to the community pot.For example, if the individual requirement for reaching the solution was 60 points, the player opting for that choice would retain only 40 of the players original 100 points.If the player instead chose to give 40 resource points to the community pot, that player would keep 60 points, a 20-point improvementas long as the community pool still added up to 160 points.The peak cost for an individual solution was 80 of the 100 resource points available to each player, double the 40 per person needed for the community option.Yet even at that rate, 15 percent of players remained diehard individualists.They were willing to give up 80 points to solve a problem individually rather than risk contributing 40 to a community pooland see other group members investing in the community pool possibly lose everything.These individualist behaviors left each group wasting an average of 45 resource points per game, more than a quarter of the 160 that they needed to collectively solve the problem.Four categories of decision-makers emerged.There were the altruists, who invested more than their fair share.The cooperators readily ponied up their 40 points to the collective.Individualists stuck to their guns, preferring to pay the individual amount rather than contribute to a collective.And then there were the free riders.They invested less than their share of at least 40 points in the collective pool (perhaps keeping 70 or 80 points for themselves) but still reaped benefits from altruists making up the difference, which Gross describes as an optimal strategy (economically speaking) for an individual.He gives cutting carbon dioxide emissions as an example: a free rider who personally takes few steps to limit carbon dioxide emissions will still benefit when others make great efforts to do so.In such a situation, peer pressure might be expected to operate most on the free-riding slackers, but thats not what happened.In one set of games, Gross and De Dreu allowed players to punish each other by dinging them with up to five peer punishments.Each punishment decreased the take for the punisher by one reward point but cost the punished peer three points.The free riders might seem like the obvious targets for this peer punishment, but they werent.Instead, the punishment turned into an expensive feuding between the altruists, who meted out the most punishments, and individualists, whom the altruists targeted.Meanwhile, the free riders and those who stuck to contributing only their fair share hung back.The feuding increased costs for the collective as a whole, which the authors say calls into question how effective unfettered peer punishment is in real life.The peer pressure worked on individualists though, Gross says.Peer punishment forced them into cooperation, but they were less willing to enforce cooperation in others, he says, with the result that free riders still continued without paying their fair share.Varnum says such an outcome needs consideration in the context of earlier findings showing culture-based differences in the effects of peer punishment.These earlier results showed that in a collectivist society with a default expectation of community participation, punishment reduces free-rider behavior.In individualistic cultures, however, punishment does not influence freeloading behaviors.Varnum says that a future study might investigate how the same study methods would play out in societies that are largely collectivist, such as India, China or Japan as opposed to the Netherlands.
How Old Are Saturn’s Rings? The Debate Rages On:::::Of our solar systems wonders, one reigns as the emblem of all that is alien and otherworldly: the majestic rings of Saturn, rising resplendent and shimmering above the giant planets buttery, cloud-crossed face.Stretching nearly 300,000 kilometers from tip to tip and containing countless icy particles ranging in size from microscopic to mobile home, the rings make Saturn undeniably eye-catching.But more than mere decoration, they are one of the most enduring enigmas in planetary science.Put simply, experts cannot agree on how the rings formed or even how old they are.Are Saturns bangles a primordial feature of the solar system, having emerged roughly 4.5 billion years ago when chaos and collisions sculpted much of what we see today?Or did they arise much more recently?The answer not only matters for scientists working to understand planetary rings and reconstruct the solar systems history; it could have dizzying implications for astrobiologists wondering whether alien life might thrive beneath the icy crust of Enceladus, a small inner moon of Saturn whose buried, global sea is considered one of the best places to look for biology beyond Earth.Though not definitive, the best available data to settle the debate came during the final years of NASAs Cassini spacecraft, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.Based on Cassinis measurements of the rings mass and brightness, many scientists now believe they are remarkably youthful, having burst into existence perhaps as recently as 100 million years ago, when dinosaurs still roamed the Earthwhich means that, viewed through some saurian telescope, Saturn could have been bizarrely bereft of rings.But not everyone is convinced; it is just too hard, some critics say, to craft such expansive rings in the relatively placid solar system of now and near-yesteryear.I have no objection to young rings.I just think no one has found a very plausible way of making them, says ring expert Luke Dones of the Southwest Research Institute.It requires an unlikely event.A Decades-Old Debate Todays debate over the provenance of Saturns rings traces its origin to several decades ago, chiefly to the first close-up reconnaissance of the system by the interplanetary Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 missions.Those observations hinted that the rings were surprisingly light, lacking sufficient heft to have retained their pearly gleam across the solar systems multibillion-year history.The rings, it seemed, were quite youngbut theorists struggled to devise a mechanism to explain their relatively recent formation.Saturn's rings, as seen by NASA's Cassini orbiter in August 2009.The ringswhich are mostly made of bright white water icedisplay subtle darkening and coloration that can be used to help estimate their age.Credit: NASA, JPL-Caltech and the Space Science Institute Then came Cassini.Towards the missions end, the spacecraft performed two dozen daring dives between Saturns cloud tops and the ring systems innermost edge.As it threaded that needle, Cassini carefully measured the mass of the rings and came up with a number similar to Voyagers: roughly half the mass of Mimas, a small icy moon bearing uncanny resemblance to the Death Star space station from Star Wars.But that is only part of the story.Earlier in its mission, the spacecraft had also grazed the edges of the rings, scooping up dust and other particles to help estimate how much dark debris the structures sopped up from their surroundingsanother crucial measurement for pinning down their age.Like its measurements of the systems mass, Cassinis readings of dust in Saturns vicinity further hinted at youthful rings: Despite being continually dusted by dark debris shed by dingy objects in the outer solar system, Saturns rings of water ice are still bright white.As the logic goes, the older the rings, the darker they should beunless they are massive enough to somehow accumulate dark dust over billions of years, while still maintaining their youthful gleam.Robin Canup, of the Southwest Research Institute, refers to this line of evidence as the pollution argument for young rings.The fact that the rings are bright tells us in some way that they have not been efficiently polluted, or at least that we dont see the evidence of that, she says.Additional observations suggest that not only are the rings absorbing material, they are also losing it in massive quantities, constantly sending showers of icy particles into the planets atmosphere.In fact, with one estimate suggesting such showers could deplete the rings within 300 million years, it seems that Saturns most distinctive feature could be surprisingly transient indeed.The idea that they could be around for 4.5 billion years really defies explanation in my mind, says Erik Asphaug of the University of Arizona, who studies interactions between Saturns rings and its many moons.Young Rings, Made to Order Even so, many compelling arguments remain against Saturns supposedly youthful rings.Making such an expansive ring system so recently, it turns out, is no small task; the odds are stacked against it.Sure, the planet could have shredded a passing comet in whole or in part, scattering the stripped remains into rings; or, yes, maybe an interloping object smashed into one of Saturns moons, forming rings from the splattered, pulverized moon-bits.But to any honest theorist, such made-to-order scenarios smack of special pleading.We do have a pretty good idea, a census, of how many comets are flying around the outer solar system, and you just dont have enough of them to make that scenario likely, Dones says.Within the last hundreds of millions of years, the chance of that is maybe a few percent.But suppose instead that no comets were involved at allthat the rings parent bodies originated entirely from within rather than outside the Saturnian system.While studying the curious orbits of the planets close-in moons, the SETI Institutes Matija uk and his colleagues found something surprising.In computer models that traced those moons orbits back in time, everything went a bit off-script roughly 100 million years ago, with the moons being jostled onto orbits that simply are not observed today.Their orbits do get knocked out of the plane of Saturn's equator way more than we observe, uk says.Meaning that this history that we are modeling never happened, and the current moons must be younger than that.In other words, an earlier system of moons must have been rearranged into the system we see today.Cassini snapped this partial portrait of Saturn's rings and moons in July 2011.From left to right, five moons are visible in this picture: Janus, Pandora (at the edge of the thin ring near the image's center), Enceladus, Mimas and Rhea.Credit: NASA, JPL-Caltech and the Space Science Institute At first, it was not clear what might have provoked that rearrangement, but subsequent work fingered an unexpected culprit: the sun.Even across vast distances, the suns gravity can perturb the motions of planetsand more importantly for this story, their moons.uk and his colleagues found that it is possible for Saturns orbit to have approached a point where the suns tenuous gravitational influence could ever so slightly nudge a large, inner moon onto a different pathway, leading to a collision with a sibling.And then you form a ring thats 10 times bigger than the ring you have now, some of which accretes and forms new moons, he says.One confounding corollary to this scenario is that Saturns existing inner moons would have, as uk says, coalesced and grown out of the collisions debrismeaning that Enceladus, Mimas and any body orbiting as close or closer to the planet than the large moon Rhea would also be about 100 million years old.This scenario, however, stands in stark contrast to age estimates for the inner moons based on counting craters on their surfaces.As well, a young Enceladus could present major problems for astrobiologists hoping that the moons global, subsurface sea has existed long enough for life to evolve there.I dont think people like to hear that, uk says.Canup and others say that while uks hypothesis is plausible, it fails to explain how the material generated by a moon-moon smashup would form a ring.To do that, the collisions debris would need to be close enough to Saturn for the planets gravity to keep it scattered, instead of in the farther-flung regions where moons form and live.How do you get material from that kind of collision back into low orbits where the rings are, and how do you get that material to be only ice?Canup asks.Primordial Pollution?The fact is, older rings are just easier to make.Billions and billions of years ago, when the planets were settling into their current positions, they rocketed smaller bodies throughout the solar system like over-caffeinated billiards players with shaky aim.So, Canup says, the most parsimonious explanation is that some ancient cataclysm adorned the previously ringless world, and scientists need to revisit their pollution argument pointing to young rings.If the rate at which dark dust falls onto the rings varies over time, or if basic assumptions about how that dust darkens the rings are wrong, it is possible for the rings to be primordialalbeit with a preternaturally sprightly sheen.Its clear that snow is beautiful and bright when it falls, and it doesnt take much dirt to make the snow look quite dark, Dones says.But, he notes, high-speed impacts between dust and icy ring particles might not be coloring the rings in the exact ways scientists suspect, perhaps depositing less shade than expected.More convincing for the old rings story, Canup says, are simulations of an ancient, ring-forming collision.If the initial mass of debris is substantially higher than that in the current rings, it will quickly spread out and dissipate.Some of it will fall into Saturn, some will escape into orbit, and the rest will settle into moons and rings.Curiously, she says, regardless of whether you start with one or 10 times the mass of Mimas, over billions of years, basic orbital dynamics suggest it will settle out at almost the exact amount of material we see today.The rings just happen to have the exact mass that one would expect if they had been colliding and spreading for four billion years, Canup says.And when Cassini observations simultaneously support old rings and young rings, albeit in different ways, landing on a final answer is tricky.When you have predictions or interpretations that are independent and end up being at odds with each other, it gets interesting, she says.Captured by Cassini in March 2016, this edge-on view of a portion of Saturn's rings also includes three moons: Mimas (at top), Janus (just above the rings) and Tethys (below the rings).Any explanation for the formation of the planet's rings must also account for its enigmatic moons.Credit: NASA, JPL-Caltech and the Space Science Institute One Ring (System) to Rule Them All Our meandering efforts to discern Saturns truth are far from complete.Something put rings around the planet even though we have yet to understand how.I see the Saturn system as being in the middle of a cascadea chaotic cascade.It doesnt look finished to me, Asphaug says.Indeed, the entire Saturn system is something of an enigma.Not only are the planets rings perplexing, but its vast and diverse array of moons are also tough to explain.From Iapetus, a two-toned moon that resembles a walnut due to a bizarre equatorial ridge and flattened poles, to hazy Titan, a giant moon with oily lakes and alien chemistry, to inner moons that might once have had rings of their own, the Saturnian system is a cornucopia of weirdness.So, any story that purports to explain the rings must also, in some way, account for these and other oddballs."I see a lot of impossible geologic things.I see a planet that should look like Callisto, but instead looks like Titan.I see satellites that shouldn't exist like Enceladus and Mimas, that have heavy cratering historieswhether that means they're old or not, we don't know.And then you see Enceladus going off like a rocket, and it's the most reliably eruptive body in the solar system, and that doesn't make any sense to me as a geologist, Asphaug says.Mimas gets more tidal heating than Enceladus and it's dead as a doornail!None of it makes sense!The solutions to Saturns mysteries, perhaps, lie in the realm of planetary dynamics, where simulations of gravitational interactions reconstruct the past (and future) of what we observe today.Or the answer might rely on laboratory-based examinations of high-speed collisions between dark dust and icy particles, to determine how exactly dust colors ice.It might mean reexamining assumptions about how likely it is for a comet to have a fateful encounter with Saturn.Or, it might require a more detailed analysis of the cratered surfaces of Saturns retinue of inner moons, to better know their true ages, perhaps by another spacecraft sent to roam the planets neighborhood.That old idea that the rings are ancient and have been steadily bombarded by polluting material thats the same as we see today?That idea wont work, says Larry Esposito, at the University of Colorado Boulder.But what possible mechanism could

Liver Illness Strikes Latino Children Like a “Silent Tsunami”:::::Saira Diaz uses her fingers to count the establishments selling fast food and sweets near the South Los Angeles home she shares with her parents and 13-year-old son.Theres one, two, three, four, five fast-food restaurants, she says.And a little mom and pop store that sells snacks and sodas and candy.In that low-income, predominantly Latino neighborhood, its pretty hard for a kid to avoid sugar.Last year, doctors at St. Johns Well Child and Family Center, a nonprofit community clinic seven blocks away, became alarmed by the rising weight of Diazs son, Adrian Mejia.They persuaded him to join an intervention study run by the University of Southern California and Childrens Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA) that weans participants off sugar in an effort to reduce the rate of obesity and diabetes among children.It also targets a third condition fewer people have heard of: fatty liver disease.Linked both to genetics and diets high in sugar and fat, fatty liver disease is ripping through the Latino community like a silent tsunami and especially affecting children, says Rohit Kohli, chief of gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition at CHLA.Recent research shows about one in four people in the U.S. have fatty liver disease.But among Latinos, especially of Mexican and Central American descent, the rate is significantly higher.One large study in Dallas found that 45 percent of Latinos had fatty livers.The illness, diagnosed when more than 5 percent of the livers weight is fat, does not cause serious problems in most people.But it can progress to a more severe condition called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, which is linked to cirrhosis, liver cancer and liver failure.This progressive form of fatty liver disease is the fastest-growing cause of liver transplants in young adults.The USC-CHLA study is led by Michael Goran, director of the Diabetes and Obesity Program at CHLA, who last year made an alarming discovery: sugar from sweetened beverages can be passed in breast milk from mothers to their babies, potentially predisposing infants to obesity and fatty livers.Called HEROES, for Healthy Eating Through Reduction of Excess Sugar, his program is designed to help children like Adrian, who used to drink four or more sugary drinks a day, shed unhealthy habits that can lead to fatty liver and other diseases.Fatty liver disease is gaining more attention in the medical community as lawmakers ratchet up pressure to discourage the consumption of sugar-laden drinks.Legislators in Sacramento are mulling proposals to impose a statewide soda tax, put warning labels on sugary drinks, and bar beverage companies from offering discount coupons on sweetened drinks.I support sugar taxes and warning labels as a way to discourage consumption, but I dont think that alone will do the trick, Goran says.We also need public health strategies that limit marketing of sugary beverages, snacks and cereals to infants and children.William Dermody, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association says: We understand that we have a role to play in helping Americans manage consumption of added sugars, which is why we are creating more drinks with less or no sugar.In 2016, 45 deaths in Los Angeles County were attributed to fatty liver disease.But thats a gross underestimate, because by the time people with the illness die, they often have cirrhosis, and thats what appears on the death certificate, says Paul Simon, chief science officer at the L.A. County Department of Public Health.Still, Simon says it was striking that 53 percent of the 2016 deaths attributed to fatty liver disease were among Latinosnearly double their proportion of total deaths in the county.Medical researchers consider the fatty liver ailment a manifestation of something called metabolic syndromea cluster of conditions that include excess belly fat and elevated blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol that can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.Until 2006 few doctors knew that children could get fatty liver disease.That year Jeffrey Schwimmer, a professor of pediatrics at the University of California San Diego, reviewed the autopsies of 742 children and teenagers, aged two to 19, who had died in car crashes or from other causes, and he found that 13 percent of them had fatty liver disease.Among obese kids, 38 percent had fatty livers.After Schwimmers study was released, Goran began using MRIs to diagnose fatty liver in living children.A 2008 study by another group of researchers nudged Goran further.It showed that a variant of a gene called PNPLA3 significantly increased the risk of the disease.About half of Latinos have one copy of that high-risk gene, and a quarter have two copies, according to Goran.He began a new study, which showed that among children as young as eight, those who had two copies of the risky gene and consumed high amounts of sugar had three times as much fat in their livers as kids with no copy of the gene.Now, in the USC-CHLA study, he is testing whether reduced consumption of sugar decreases the fatty liver risk in children who have the PNPLA3 gene variant.At the start of the study, he tests kids to see if they have the PNPLA3 gene, uses an MRI to measure their liver fat and catalogs their sugar intake.A dietitian on his team educates the family about the impact of sugar.Then, after four months, they measure liver fat again to assess the impact of the intervention.Goran expects to have results from the study in about a year.More recently, Goran has been investigating the transmission of sugar from mothers to their babies.He showed last year that in nursing mothers who drank beverages sweetened with high-fructose corn syrupthe primary sweetener in standard formulations of Coca-Cola, Pepsi and other sodasthe fructose level in their breast milk rose and stayed elevated for several hours, ensuring that the baby ingested it.This early exposure to sugar could be contributing to obesity, diabetes and fatty livers, based on previous research that showed fructose can enhance the fat storage capacity of cells, Goran says.In neighborhoods like South Los Angeles, where Saira Diaz and Adrian Mejia live, a lack of full-service markets and fresh produce makes it harder to eat healthily.Access to unhealthy food optionswhich are usually cheaperis very high in this city, Derek Steele, director of health equity programs at the Social Justice Learning Institute in Inglewood, Calif., told Kaiser Health News.The institute has started farmers markets, helped convert two corner stores into markets with healthier food options and created 109 community gardens on public and private lands in South L.A. and neighboring Inglewood, which has 125 liquor and convenience stores and 150 fast-food outlets.The HEROES program seems to be working for Adrian Mejia.After he gave up sugary beverages, his liver fat dropped by 43 percent.Two months ago he joined a soccer league.Before, I weighed a lot and it was hard to run, he says.If I kept going at the pace I was going, probably later in my life I would be like my [diabetic] grandma.I dont want that to happen.Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.It is an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation that is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.
Watch Now: Einstein’s Scientific Revolution and the Limits of Quantum Theory:::::Lee Smolin, author of six books about the philosophical issues raised by contemporary physics, says every time he writes a new one, the experience completely changes the direction his own research is taking.In his latest book, Einsteins Unfinished Revolution: The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum, Smolin, a cosmologist and quantum theorist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Ontario, tackles what he sees as the limitations in quantum theory.I want to say the scientific worldview is based on fallacious reasoning at certain key points, Smolin says.In Einsteins Unfinished Revolution, he argues one of those key points was the assumption that quantum physics is a complete theory.This incompleteness, Smolin argues, is the reason quantum physics has not been able to solve certain questions about the universe.Most of what we do [in science] is take the laws that have been discovered by experiments to apply to parts of the universe, and just assume that they can be scaled up to apply to the whole universe, Smolin says.Im going to be suggesting thats wrong.Join Smolin at the Perimeter Institute as he discusses his book and takes the audience on a journey through the basics of quantum physics and the experiments and scientists who have changed our understanding of the universe.The discussion, Einsteins Unfinished Revolution, is part of Perimeters public lecture series and will take place on Wednesday, April 17, at 7 P.M. Eastern time.Online viewers can participate in the discussion by tweeting to @Perimeter using the #piLIVE hashtag.
How France Can Rebuild Notre Dame:::::The world watched helplessly this week as Pariss treasured Notre Dame cathedral went up in flames.Although fire brigades managed to save parts of the building, such as the bell towers, the blaze destroyed the roof and spirealong with countless artifacts.However, this is not the first time Notre Dame has suffered major damage, and the reconstruction project to come (donors have already pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to the effort) is neither the first nor likely the last for the cathedral.This building is an archaeological palimpsest, says Dimitris Theodossopoulos, a civil engineer at the University of Edinburgh.Our generation simply adds something to this, and the next generation will add something else.Theodossopoulos specializes in conservation and has studied Gothic vaults as well as the stability of stone walls.Scientific American spoke with him about what remains of Notre Dame, what has been lost, and how its reconstruction will unfold.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]After the fire was extinguished, debris covered the altar inside Notre Dame.Credit: Ludovic Marin Getty Images What have they managed to save?It seems that most of the stone fabric is intact.The bells, another important artifact of the cathedral, are housed at the front towers.They were afraid they would melt, and more pieces of history would be lost, but then they managed to stop the fire there.Every major Christian building usually prides themselves on having relics of this and that saint.Some of that was lost; some, since they are movable, were moved away very quickly And what has been lost?The whole roof is gone; all the timber elements have gone.The spire, of course, is the most dramatic [loss].There have been at least a few images of the interior, where we can see damage on the furnishings and decorations.I think all the permanent paintings and sculpture within the cathedral might have been severely damaged because of falling debris or the heat.Most of the religious objects, heavy artifacts that could not be movedsmall altarpieces, little chapels, statues, urns, fontshave been affected.The altar, for example: there was this little video that the fire brigade released, which shows the altar where the services happen being completely destroyed.What about the stained-glass windows?It seems that the major rose window on the south faade is intact.But some of the smaller ones, the windows that were closer to the roof, might have deformed.Remember its lead [used in the windows], so it melts easily.And maybe also the fact of quick coolingwhen you throw water at something very hotthe cold water the fire brigade threw might have even further damaged and cracked some of the stained glass.How do you repair something like that?It depends on the damage.For small, round windows, it can be just a matter of salvaging any original fragments and recomposing them.The good thing with Notre Dame is its a quite well-documented building, so they may have very good pictures or even drawings of the damaged stained glass.Some of [the windows] might have even been replaced in the major restoration of the mid-19th century.If [the window is] small, its just a replacement, a logical composition of what is useful to salvage.If its major, like the big rose windows, theres a structural implication sometimes.If you look up close at a stone window, you can see that all the framingthe mullions that contain the stained glassare really thin stone beams.And yes, stone is an incombustible material; but with high heat it might start cracking here and there.So, they might have to take it apart and really look at it as a microstructure.This can take a couple of years; its quite unique.Understanding how the structure works is very important, then producing the missing stained glass, and then reproducing any stone element.And then putting all that together requires a very delicate operation.Stone doesnt burn, but the timber parts of the building did.What role does timber play in the cathedrals structure?The stone roofing and the whole stone structure is what we see from the interior.However, these buildings need protection from the elements, so all these cathedrals also have a timber roof.The double-pitched roof you see very often in these buildings is a timber truss, a triangular arrangement of timber beams to form a pitched roof.Thats the broad difference: the roof is timber, all the rest of the structure is stone.This fire made very clear why stone is important.Because stone is incombustible, it doesnt burn.But the roof is being pushed outwards as it collapses, and then it drags the fabric [of the building] with it.Its indirect damage that happens with the stonework: not from the heat itself, but from the collapse of the roof.If you look at the pictures of the interior, you will see this gaping hole right below the spire.The spire collapsedit was timber covered with lead, so its completely flammableand pierced through the stonework.How will they start repairing some of this damage?Even if there are any pieces of timber left behind, this has more of an archaeological value, so they would take them aside and salvage them.First of all, they have to secure the stone fabric.Becauseas the wall was collapsing and deforming and opening up, and as they are going to remove the timberschances are that the top edge of the building will be very delicate.So, the first thing they will have to do is brace the stoneworks, apply probably a very big long bracing on all the top of the cathedral.[This is] similar to what they did in another important church, St. Francis of Assisi, that was damaged in 97 in Italy.The bracing cancels deformations, and also bonds the building a bit better together.So that will be the first step, and then they will have to think about the roof.Were talking about north of France, which can snow very heavily, so that means a high-pitched, permanent roof.Many cathedrals like Reims and Soissons were destroyed in the First World War at the borders with Germany and Belgium, where the major battles happened.Again, the fire destroyed the soft elements like the timber, but the stonework remained.In Reims, there was this project of reconstructing the roof with concrete ribs instead of having a timber truss, as with most cathedrals at the time.This guy [architect Henri Deneux] built a roof like the keel of a ship upside down, but with fireproof concrete ribs, very much in line with the fireproofing of stone vaults.Concrete is heavier than timber, but the sections were thinner, and that meant that the weight of the new concrete roof was similar to the weight of the traditional timber roof.That could be a solution, a way forward.Do you think they would do that here in Notre Dame?I would strongly recommend it because it bypasses [the fire] problem.This could happen againit will not happen in 30 years, because we will be very alert, but a lead replacement in 40, 50 years might cause exactly the same problem.Its like a lesson to everybody that we can apply innovations to these buildings, can further secure them in the future, and bypass all the problems that timber has been bringing.Fireproofing completely is the first priority.How will they make the restoration authentic?All these major cathedrals have gone through so many phases.The original construction of the cathedralwhich was already modifying earlier phaseswas completely concluded around the 13th century, over 100, 150 years.Then many modifications happened.Each of [these phases] is authentic in its own merits, because it represents the ambitions of the period, the technology of the period, how people would understand or misunderstand the buildinghistorical cultural importance.So, it is very important to understand the weighting of each of these phases into the current image we have about conservation.There was major damage after the French Revolution, and then a major restoration in the mid-19th century, which triggered a lot of debate.[Eugne] Viollet-le-Duc was an engineer, and he would pick up a style that he thought was the right oneGothic, for himand he would kind of force the remnants of the building to follow that.As you do that, since the science of archaeology was not very well-developed back then, of course you make many mistakes.Even with some not-very-correct premises, the 19th-century restoration managed to see the building as a wholethis vast conglomerate of arts, architecture, history, and cultural significanceand they applied a holistic approach.It is a paradigm of restoration which you find often in conservation books My understanding now is that it will again go through a holistic approach.They will review everything that happens: the daily religious life of the building, its culture significance, the flow for tourists, safetymany things will be put on the table.Some of it might bypass or sideline some of the original features in order to promote modern ones.I think it should be once again an emblematic restoration, in the sense that it should create debate.It should attract the best engineers, the best materials, important innovation.This building is an archaeological palimpsest.Our generation simply adds something to this, and the next generation will add something else.Its an ongoing thing we need to consider.
‘Oumuamua-Like Objects Might Supercharge Planet Formation:::::Ice and rocks booted from their star during the planet-formation process may serve as the seeds for new worlds in other systems.Stripped from their parent suns, these objects can find themselves passing close by unfamiliar stars.Yet unlike the solar systems first known interstellar visitor, Oumuamua, which whizzed past our sun in 2018, such bits of interstellar flotsam may settle down to staywhile also catalyzing the formation of new worlds.Planet formation is a messy process in which worlds emerge from the embryonic disks of gas and dust that give birth to stars themselves.As debris clumps together and grows, whirling around the central star, its gravity pushes and scatters smaller clumps throughout the disk.Gas giant planets make the biggest bullies, hurling material into their star or out of the system entirely.Jupiter is thought to have tossed out tens of Earth-masses of debris early in the life of the solar system.Material at the edge of a planetary system can also be stripped away by the gravity of a passing star.Multiple theories postulate that such processes are responsible for sending Oumuamua our way.Researchers have proposed that the strange object may have been thrown out of its young system after a brush with a giant planet there.While pondering the origins of Oumuamua over breakfast during a workshop on the curious visitor, Susanne Pfalzner of the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy and Michele Bannister of Queens University Belfast raised an intriguing question: what would happen if something like Oumuamua dropped in on a system still in the midst of building planets?Previous research has suggested that ejected objects can travel at speeds anywhere between the orbital velocity of their star to well in excess of the escape velocity of their galaxy; that latter group of objects usually leaves the galaxy completely and do not interact with planetary formation.Using these estimates, the pair found that most kicked-out debris would be moving far too fast to be captured gravitationally elsewhere, instead simply cruising through star systems, much as Oumuamua did in our own.But according to their analysis, roughly 10 million 10- to 1,000-meter objects out of the billions intersecting each disk would travel at the right speed to become permanent residents, with bigger planet-forming disks being more likely to accept such interstellar immigrants.At such a disks outskirts, where the central stars gravitational grip is relatively weak, clumps of native material can gravitationally capture passing intruders.That is when things start to get really interesting.Just like native-born rocks, the interstellar visitors will begin to gather material, growing into larger and larger objects, the researchers found.Yet when sizable interstellar interlopers settle down in particularly young systems that have yet to form their own coterie of kilometer-scale planetary building blocks, they can act to accelerate the entire process of assembling worlds, rapidly gobbling up stray material to grow very large, very fast.Having those present during planet formation would basically speed up the whole thing, Pfalzner says.A Catalyst for Planet Formation?This idea of interstellar debris acting as an accelerant for planet formation could potentially help solve several lingering mysteries.For one thing, giant planets seem to take too long to form according to many models.A giant planets multiple-Earth-mass solid core must grow very quickly, before the gas in a disk disappearsotherwise it will not be able to scoop up enough material to build a gas giants thick atmosphere.Observations of protoplanetary disks around young stars suggest such gas reserves dissipate after only a few million years.Yet if such disks are seeded with materials hurled from other planetary systems, that could theoretically jumpstart the process.Pfalzner and Bannisters ideas remain preliminary; researchers still need to model how much time could be shaved off by a peppering of interstellar immigrants.Alessandro Morbidelli, who studies planet formation at the Cte dAzur Observatory in France, says that such a theory only serves to push the problem backward.In other words, the universes very first planetary systems would have formed without seeding from external sources, and would thus still face a time crunch when trying to form giant planets.Pfalzner argues instead that it is entirely possible those first planet-building disks lasted longer than the ones observed today.One possibility relies on the fact that the very first stars had extremely low levels of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium as compared with subsequent stellar generations.This relative paucity of heavy elements could easily lead to differences in early stars planet-forming disks that allowed them to produce planets faster.More Questions Than Answers It is also possible that the supposed time limit on the formation of gas giants is not as clear-cut and universal even for modern-day disks.Key aspects of planet-forming disks remain mysterious for researchers.For example, although most disks vanish in three to five million years, a few oddballs appear to be as old as 10 or 20 million years.No one knows what causes gas in such disks to stick around.We still dont have a good handle on what makes disks disappear and how long that takes place, Chambers says.The gas in a disk may be swept up by planets, blown off by stellar winds, ionized by a stars ultraviolet or x-ray light, or even channeled away by magnetic fields.Morbidelli also wonders why scientists are not seeing much evidence of interstellar intrusion in solar system samples preserved from our suns epoch of planet formation.But according to Conel Alexander, a meteorite researcher at the Carnegie Institution of Science, an early intruder would no longer stand out.The exotic objects would have been thoroughly mixed with the more abundant solar system materials and we would be hard-pressed to detect the isotopic anomalies, he says.Edward Young, a geochemist at the University of California, Los Angeles, agrees with Alexander.Young says that exotic materials would not look too different from the familiar rocks of the solar system.He points to observations of dying stars called white dwarfs, which from time to time can be seen devouring rocky material from expired planets.According to Young, the ratios of major elements for that alien debris are similar to those for rocks around the sun, although not exactly the same.Its not obvious to me that they would be that different, Young says.Although preliminary, the new idea is a very provocative idea that deserves some attention, says Sean Raymond, an astronomer at the Laboratory of Astrophysics of Bordeaux in France who models the early solar system.By drawing attention to the need to include Oumuamua-like objects in models of planet formation, Pfalzner and Bannister have acted as catalysts themselves, fostering what will very likely become a long-term discussion.Its going to take a while to work through the implications, Chambers says.
Microplastics Are Blowing in the Wind:::::Amid the rugged peaks of the Vicdessos region of the French Pyrenees, the only visible signs of a human presence are a smattering of villages and the odd hiker or skier; it is considered a pristine environment.But even here, scientists have detected tiny pieces of plastic falling out of the air like artificial dust.A first-of-its-kind study finds these particles have blown in on the wind from at least 100 kilometers away and likely much farther.This is a clear indication that atmospheric transport is yet another way plastic pollution is being distributed around the planet, even to remote areas.And it suggests that this is a far bigger problem than we have currently thought about, says study co-author Deonie Allen, of the cole Nationale Suprieure Agronomique de Toulouse (ENSAT).The study, published Monday in Nature Geoscience, is one of only a handful that have attempted to measure how much plastic is falling from the atmosphere.It marks the first wave in what is likely to be a flood of such studies in the coming years, in an effort to fill in the picture of how microplastics move around the environment and how humans might be exposed to them.The field site in the French Pyrenees where researchers sampled microplastics falling out of the atmosphere.Credit: Deonie Allen Nobody Had Looked Up Microplastics are tiny pieces that break off larger plastic items (such as bottles and bags) as they degrade in the environment, as well as the fibers that slough off synthetic fabrics.They come in a wide range of sizesfrom a grain of rice down to a virusand are made up of a complex variety of polymers and added chemicals.Most research to detect microplastics in the environment has been done in the ocean, where they were first noticed, but scientists have slowly realized they are also present in freshwater systems, soil and the atmosphere.The first study to measure plastic fallout from the atmosphereconducted in Pariswas published only in 2015.The recent attention to the issue means that there are only a handful of measurements of airborne plastic, and little sense of how the numbers might vary from place to place, depending on weather conditions and where the material is ultimately coming from.Allen and her colleagues knew microplastics had been found in rivers and sediments in the Pyrenees, but no one had determined the sources.The bulk could not have come from local sources because of the small human population and limited industrial activity, so Allen was struck by a key question: Why havent we looked up?That is what she and her colleagues did, taking advantage of atmospheric measuring equipment already in place in the Pyrenees and sampling over five months.They found plastic fibers, films and shards, all in a range of sizes.Most of the polymers that turned up in the samples were polystyrene, polyethylene and polypropylene, which are all common in single-use plastic products such as bags and foam food containers.A close-up image of one of the plastic fibers the researchers found in their samples.Credit: Steve Allen A First Peek Because the new study included smaller sizes of particles than previous studies, the researchers found more plastic particles overall; this bears out a recurring trend in microplastics research findings that the smaller the size of the particles, the more of them there are.When comparing only the size ranges examined in the 2015 Paris study, Allen and her colleagues found a similar amount of microplastic, which was unexpected given the disparate environments of the two studies.This could mean that the new study gives us a background level of microplastic that you probably get pretty much everywhere in the world, says Melanie Bergmann, a marine ecologist with the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI), who studies microplastics but was not involved in the new research.But because the samples were averaged over a whole month, it could be that the background level in the Pyrenees is lower but is punctuated by periodic plumes of microplastics coming in from populated areas.The study did not pinpoint precisely where the microplastics originated, but used computer models of atmospheric currents to attempt to back-trace the air that brought them inthe first study to do so.They could only trace the air masses regionally, but were able to show the primary directions they came from.It was clear that the relatively small towns and villages were unlikely to account for all of the plastic they detected, which suggests the ultimate sources are more distant.A close-up image fragment of white plastic found in the samples.Credit: Steve Allen While such tracking is an important step, says microplastic researcher Stephanie Wright, of Kings College London, who wasnt involved in the research, you kind of need to know the sources to understand the back trajectory more.Different plastics may be coming from different sources, and an airstream could just pick up bits as it goes, she says.The authors say their work is only a first peek at the larger airborne microplastics picture.Many more samples from across the worldas well as lab experiments that see how different shapes, types and sizes of plastics behave in different meteorological conditionsare needed to understand the full scope of the situation, including how much microplastics humans might be inhaling.Both Wright and Bergmann have pending studies that measure microplastic fallout in London and the Arctic, respectively, and these will add more data.Allen and her colleagues, too, are working to expand their research.Co-author Steve Allen, of ENSAT and the University of Strathclyde, says that we should, in the next few years, get a much better picture of whats going on.
Environmental Thinker Bill McKibben Sounds Warning on Technology:::::When author and environmentalist Bill McKibben wrote The End of Nature in 1989, the world was a very different place.The science behind climate change was not as sophisticated, the publics understanding of the issue more limited, and the real-world effects of global warming far less obvious to the average person.Thirty years and more than a degree Celsius of warming later, humanity has yet to seriously deal with the planets climate problem.Heat-trapping greenhouse gases continue to build up in the atmosphere, and the U.S. government has failed to take meaningful action to curb them.And in addition to climate change, McKibben now sees two other existential threats facing humanity: artificial intelligence and human genetic engineering.He writes about these issues in his new book, Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?Scientific American spoke with McKibben, founder of the climate change organization 350.org, about the motivation behind his book, why he believes these problems are so perilous, and how humankind might address its self-created crises.[An edited transcript of the interview follows.]What is different, in terms of climate change, since you wrote The End of Nature in 1989?In 1989 there was still something somewhat abstract about the threat [of climate change].We knew it was coming, the science was clear, but you couldn't yet take a picture of it.Thirty years later it's the dominant fact of daily life for hundreds of millions of people every day around the world who are dealing with some flood, drought, wildfire or the steady rise of the oceansall the things we've unleashed.So it is a very different situation in that way.It is real now.You draw attention to what you call two other existential threats to humanityartificial intelligence and human germline genetic engineering.Why do you think these three issues are the most alarming?These are the other things that potentially shift what we've understood to be our place on this planet.Just as climate change dramatically undermines nature, so these shifts dramatically challenge human nature.For artificial intelligence, people have speculated about all kinds of disaster scenarios.Maybe they're true, maybe they're not.But even if AI works as it's supposed to, the inevitable result will be the supplanting of human beings as the measure of meaning in the world.And to what end?So that we can make things happen more quickly?Why do we want that?What is the point?It seems to me that those are the questions we haven't even begun to ask.There are obviously big practical worries about what it means to start etching inequality into our genes [by theoretically genetically engineering human embryos]what are the health risks and so on.Those are all persuasive and powerful reasons not to do [human germline genetic engineering].But they don't get at the deepest reason, which has to do with the meaning of being human.Just as it turned out that we were wrong to take the stability of the physical world for granted, we're also wrong to take the meaning of a human life for granted.I fear that it's not going to prove very hard to undermine that.Do you only see these two technologies (AI and germline engineering) as dangerous?Or do they also have something positive to offer people?Technologies come with a suite of benefits and costs.The classic example is fossil fuels: they did amazing things for us until we reached a point where we were using them in such quantity that they were doing damage.Now we need to find other ways to power our lives.I truthfully don't think that human genetic engineering offers us much in the way of benefit.If people are worried about genetic disease, we can already deal with that through preimplantation genetic diagnosis, which is used in fertility clinics around the world.It lets you make sure your child doesn't have a genetic disease, but it doesn't let you improve your child.So I don't think the benefits [of human germline genetic engineering] are very high, and the potential costin terms of meaningis enormous.Some might say that you're being overly alarmist, especially in terms of AI and genetic engineering.How would you respond to that critique?I'm used to it because people said it for years about climate change.I wish that I had been [overly alarmist].If anything, we've been under-alarmist about it.I think the biggest problem around AI and human genetic engineering is that we're barely discussing them in these terms.One of the points of this book is to get that discussion underway as fast as we can.Given how little we've done to address climate change, where do we go from here?Do you see any potential solutions that could help us address the problem in time?The good news is that the engineers have done their job with remarkable speed and power.Thirty years ago we didn't know what was going to replace coal, oil and gaswe just knew they had to be replaced.But in the last decade, the price of a solar panel has dropped 90 percent.In most of the world now, solar and wind are the cheapest ways to produce energy.But we're not making the transition quickly enoughnot for lack of engineering, but for lack of political will.The fossil fuel industry has so much political power and it's willing to use it to maintain its business model, even at the expense of breaking the planet.So it's going to take a one-two punch of great engineering and great movement building.Over the last 10 years we've built a climate movement really out of nothing, and it continues to grow.You saw remarkable stuff this year with schoolchildren across the planet leaving their classrooms, demanding action.We're seeing young people push for a Green New Deal in the U.S.I don't know exactly what form all this will eventually take, in terms of legislation and policy, but I do know that that ferment is a good sign.People are not going to take this lying down.How do we address these other existential threatsAI and genetic engineering?Will the approach be similar to climate change?We're a little earlier in the curve, but you can already see people beginning to try and figure out responses to themthough I don't think people are talking deeply enough yet and I imagine it'll require movement-building in order to get those big conversations going.There are elements on both the political left and right that are made uneasy by these new technologies, and it will be interesting to see whether or not they can figure out how to work together.Why did you write this book?What are you hoping it will accomplish?When I wrote The End of Nature 30 years ago, my theory of change was simple.I was 27 years old; I thought people would read my book and then they would change.I now know that that's not the way change happens.Books and arguments are one part of what needs to happen, but I spend most of my time now building movements.I think those are what really will move the needle.I hope that this book contributes a little to that movement-building process.But I also just want to mark where we are.Thirty years ago my greatest fear for climate change, in a way, was that we'd walk off this cliff without even recognizing it.I think now at least there's going to be a serious fight.And that is, at the very least, a more dignified way for humans to be engaging with this greatest of crises.
A Second Planet May Orbit Earth's Nearest Neighboring Star:::::Berkeley, Calif.Astronomers say they may have detected a second planet around Proxima Centauri, our solar systems nearest neighboring star.Announced at Breakthrough Discuss, an annual invitation-only interdisciplinary meeting held by the Breakthrough Initiatives (a scientific research organization primarily bankrolled by the Silicon Valley billionaire Yuri Milner), the planets existence remains unconfirmedfor now.Dubbed Proxima c, it would be a so-called super-Earth, with a minimum mass roughly six times that of our planets.Its approximately 1900-day orbit would likely make it a frigid, inhospitable place, orbiting some 1.5 times the Earth-sun distance from Proxima Centauriwhich is a red dwarf star some four light-years away that is much smaller and dimmer than our familiar yellow sun.If confirmed, the newfound world would join Proxima b, a roughly Earth-mass planet discovered in 2016 in a more clement orbit around Proxima Centauri.According to the scientists making the presentationMario Damasso of the Astrophysical Observatory of Turin and Fabio Del Sordo of the University of Cretethe tentative detection is based upon the same expansive multi-year dataset that first revealed Proxima b, with the addition of more than 60 further measurements of the star taken in 2017.Primarily gathered through the European Southern Observatorys (ESO) HARPS instrument, the measurements look for planets by the telltale wobbling such worlds induce upon their host stars.The strength of such wobbles provides an estimate of a worlds mass; the wobbles period yields a planets orbit.Among other incidental evidence, the wobble of Proxima ca subtle swerve in the position of Proxima Centauri by slightly more than a meter per secondappeared in earlier observations to be of borderline significance, but was pushed into firmer territory by the last few years of additional measurements.The search for Proxima Centauri's planets has been spearheaded by the international Pale Red Dot planet-hunting team.The results are summarized in a paper that has been submitted to a peer-reviewed journal.It is only a candidate, Damasso said during the presentation.This is very important to underline.Del Sordo offered similar cautions in his remarks, comparing the candidate world to a castle in the air, one that we should keep working to put even stronger foundations under.(Neither Damasso nor Del Sordo would make further comments on the record outside of their presentation, citing concerns about the embargo policies of the journal to which they submitted their paper.)Further measurements with HARPS, the pair said, could ultimately confirm the planetary nature of Proxima c, as could follow-up studies with other facilities on the ground and in space.ESOs next-generation planet-hunting ESPRESSO instrument on the Very Large Telescope in Chile, for example, would be able to detect the wobble caused by the candidate world with even higher fidelity.But most promising would be observations from the European Space Agencys Milky-Way-mapping Gaia satellite, which is monitoring the motions and positions of more than a billion stars in our galaxyincluding, it turns out, Proxima Centauri.Gaia could detect the planets presence by watching for wobbles, too.By the conclusion of its nominal five-year mission later this year, Del Sordo said, Gaia could provide a decisive answer as to whether or not Proxima c is real.Beyond mere detection, the candidate planet would offer exciting opportunities for follow-up studies to characterize its nature, the presenting scientists said.According to Del Sordo, Proxima c would be a spectacular laboratory for direct imagingastronomers parlance for snapping a planets picture across the vast gulfs of interstellar space.Proxima b has been discussed as a fruitful target for direct imaging as well.But because Proxima c is further out from the star than b, it should be easier to see.Potentially within reach of future space observatories such as NASAs James Webb Space Telescope and Webbs planned successor, the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope, the planet could become the first world beyond the solar system imaged in reflected light.(Previous direct images of planets have been in infrared light, where the glare of a planets star is less overwhelming.)Any image of Proxima c presuming the planet proves genuine would likely reveal a chilly, gas-dominated orb, but could still prove extremely useful for astronomers struggling to understand what super-Earths are actually like.Despite being the most common known variety of planet in the Milky Way, super-Earths are entirely absent from our own solar system.Midway in mass and size between Earth and Neptune, super-Earths may either be mostly gassy planets offering slim chances for life as we know it, or instead super-sized versions of our own habitable, rocky world.Images of planets in the Proxima Centauri system might also help resolve lingering debates over the potential for red dwarf stars to harbor habitable planets; such stars are often more active than solar-type stars, blasting accompanying worlds with showers of high-speed particles and hard radiation that can strip away atmospheres like so much sand-blasted paint.Pictures could resolve the fates of such worldsprovided, that is, astronomers manage to secure time on Earths most powerful telescopes to go look.
Behind the Buzz: How Ketamine Changes the Depressed Patient's Brain:::::The Food and Drug Administration's approval last month of a depression treatment based on ketamine generated headlines, in part, because the drug represents a completely new approach for dealing with a condition the World Health Organisation has labelled the leading cause of disability worldwide.The FDA's approval marks the first genuinely new type of psychiatric drugfor any conditionto be brought to market in more than 30 years.Although better known as a party drug, the anesthetic ketamine has spurred excitement in psychiatry for almost 20 years, since researchers first showed that it alleviated depression in a matter of hours.The rapid reversal of symptoms contrasted sharply with the existing set of antidepressants, which take weeks to begin working.Subsequent studies have shown ketamine works for patients who have failed to respond to multiple other treatments, and so are deemed "treatment-resistant."Despite this excitement, researchers still don't know exactly how ketamine exerts its effects.A leading theory proposes that it stimulates regrowth of synapses (connections between neurons), effectively rewiring the brain.Researchers have seen these effects in animals' brains, but the exact details and timing are elusive.A new study, from a team led by neuroscientist and psychiatrist Conor Liston at Weill Cornell Medicine, has confirmed that synapse growth is involved, but not in the way many researchers were expecting.Using cutting-edge technology to visualize and manipulate the brains of stressed mice, the study reveals how ketamine first induces changes in brain circuit function, improving "depressed" mice's behavior within three hours, and only later stimulating regrowth of synapses.As well as shedding new light on the biology underlying depression, the work suggests new avenues for exploring how to sustain antidepressant effects over the long term."It's a remarkable engineering feat, where they were able to visualize changes in neural circuits over time, corresponding with behavioral effects of ketamine," says Carlos Zarate, chief of the Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch at the National Institute of Mental Health, who was not involved in the study."This work will likely set a path for what treatments should be doing before we move them into the clinic."Another reason ketamine has researchers excited is that it works differently than existing antidepressants.Rather than affecting one of the "monoamine" neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine), as standard antidepressants do, it acts on glutamate, the most common chemical messenger in the brain.Glutamate plays an important role in the changes synapses undergo in response to experiences that underlie learning and memory.That is why researchers suspected such "neuroplasticity" would lie at the heart of ketamine's antidepressant effects.Ketamine's main drawback is its side effects, which include out-of-body experiences, addiction and bladder problems.It is also not a "cure."The majority of recipients who have severe, difficult-to-treat depression will ultimately relapse.A course of multiple doses typically wears off within a few weeks to months.Little is known about the biology underlying depressive states, remission and relapse."A big question in the field concerns the mechanisms that mediate transitions between depression states over time," Liston says."We were trying to get a better handle on that in the hopes we might be able to figure out better ways of preventing depression and sustaining recovery."Chronic stress depletes synapses in certain brain regions, notably the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), an area implicated in multiple aspects of depression.Mice subjected to stress display depressionlike behaviors, and with antidepressant treatment, they often improve.In the new study, the researchers used light microscopes to observe tiny structures called spines located on dendrites (a neuron's "input" wires) in the mPFC of stressed mice.Spines play a key role because they form synapses if they survive for more than a few days.For the experiment, some mice became stressed when repeatedly restrained, others became so after they were administered the stress hormone corticosterone."That's a strength of this study," says neuroscientist Anna Beyeler, of the University of Bordeaux, France, who was not involved in the work, but wrote an accompanying commentary article in Science."If you're able to observe the same effects in two different models, this really strengthens the findings."The team first observed the effects of subjecting mice to stress for 21 days, confirming that this resulted in lost spines.The losses were not random, but clustered on certain dendrite branches, suggesting the damage targets specific brain circuits.The researchers then looked a day after administering ketamine and found that the number of spines increased.Just over half appeared in the same location as spines that were previously lost, suggesting a partial reversal of stress-induced damage.Depressionlike behaviors caused by the stress also improved.The team measured brain circuit function in the mPFC, also impaired by stress, by calculating the degree to which activity in cells was coordinated, a measure researchers term "functional connectivity."This too improved with ketamine.When the team looked closely at the timing of all this, they found that improvements in behavior and circuit function both occurred within three hours, but new spines were not seen until 12 to 24 hours after treatment.This suggests that the formation of new synapses is a consequence, rather than cause, of improved circuit function.Yet they also saw that mice who regrew more spines after treatment performed better two to seven days later."These findings suggest that increased ensemble activity contributes to the rapid effects of ketamine, while increased spine formation contributes to the sustained antidepressant actions of ketamine," says neuroscientist Ronald Duman, of the Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study.Although the molecular details of what happens in the first hours are not yet fully understood, it seems a restoration of coordinated circuit activity occurs first; this is then entrenched by neuroplasticity effects in synapses, which then maintain behavioral benefits over time.To prove that new synapses were a cause of antidepressant effects, rather than just coinciding with the improved behaviors, the team used a newly developed optogenetic technique, which allowed them to eliminate newly formed spines using light.Optogenetics works by introducing viruses that genetically target cells, causing them to produce light-sensitive proteins.In this case, the protein is expressed in newly formed synapses, and exposure to blue light causes the synapse to collapse.The researchers found that eliminating newly formed synapses in ketamine-treated mice abolished some of the drug's positive effects, two days after treatment, confirming that new synapses are needed to maintain benefits."Many mechanisms are surely involved in determining why some people relapse and some don't," Liston says, " but we think our work shows that one of those involves the durability of these new synapses that form."And Liston adds: "Our findings open up new avenues for research, suggesting that interventions aimed at enhancing the survival of these new synapses might be useful for extending ketamine's antidepressant effects."The implication is that targeting newly formed spines might be useful for maintaining remission after ketamine treatment."This is a great question and one the field has been considering," Duman says."This could include other drugs that target stabilization of spines, or behavioral therapies designed to engage the new synapses and circuits, thereby strengthening them."The study used three behavioral tests: one involving exploration, a second a struggle to escape, and a third an assessment of how keen the mice are on a sugar solution.This last test is designed to measure anhedoniaa symptom of depression in which the ability to experience pleasure is lost.This test was unaffected by deleting newly formed spines, suggesting that the formation of new synapses in the mPFC is important for some symptoms, such as apathy, but not others (anhedonia)and that different aspects of depression involve a variety of brain circuits.These results could relate to a study published last year that found activity in another brain region, the lateral habenula, is crucially involved in anhedonia, and injecting ketamine directly into this region improves anhedonia-related behavior in mice."We're slowly identifying specific regions associated with specific behaviors," Beyeler says."The factors leading to depression might be different depending on the individual, so these different models might provide information regarding the causes of depression."One caveat is that the study looked at only a single dose, rather than the multiple doses involved in a course of human treatment, Zarate says.After weeks of repeated treatments, might the spines remain, despite a relapse, or might they dwindle, despite the mice still doing well?"Ongoing effects with repeated administration, we don't know," Zarate says."Some of that work will start taking off now, and we'll learn a lot more."Of course, the main caution is that stressed mice are quite far from humans with depression."There's no real way to measure synaptic plasticity in people, so it's going to be hard to confirm these findings in humans," Beyeler says.
The Mathematics of (Hacking) Passwords:::::At one time or another, we have all been frustrated by trying to set a password, only to have it rejected as too weak.We are also told to change our choices regularly.Obviously such measures add safety, but how exactly?I will explain the mathematical rationale for some standard advice, including clarifying why six characters are not enough for a good password and why you should never use only lowercase letters.I will also explain how hackers can uncover passwords even when stolen data sets lack them.ChOose#W!sely@* Here is the logic behind setting hack-resistant passwords.When you are asked to create a password of a certain length and combination of elements, your choice will fit into the realm of all unique options that conform to that ruleinto the space of possibilities.For example, if you were told to use six lowercase letterssuch as, afzjxd, auntie, secret, wwwwwwthe space would contain 266, or 308,915,776, possibilities.In other words, there are 26 possible choices for the first letter, 26 possible choices for the second, and so forth.These choices are independent: you do not have to use different letters, so the size of the password space is the product of the possibilities, or 26 x 26 x 26 x 26 x 26 x 26 = 266.If you are told to select a 12-character password that can include uppercase and lowercase letters, the 10 digits and 10 symbols (say, !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, ?, / and +), you would have 72 possibilities for each of the 12 characters of the password.The size of the possibility space would then be 7212 (19,408,409,961,765,342,806,016, or close to 19 x 1021).That is more than 62 trillion times the size of the first space.A computer running through all the possibilities for your 12-character password one by one would take 62 trillion times longer.If your computer spent a second visiting the six-character space, it would have to devote two million years to examining each of the passwords in the 12-character space.The multitude of possibilities makes it impractical for a hacker to carry out a plan of attack that might have been feasible for the six-character space.Calculating the size of these spaces by computer usually involves counting the number of binary digits in the number of possibilities.That number, N, is derived from this formula: 1 + integer(log 2 (N)).In the formula, the value of log 2 (N) is a real number with many decimal places, such as log 2 (266) = 28.202638.The integer in the formula indicates that the decimal portion of that log value is omitted, rounding down to a whole numberas in integer(28.202638 28).For the example of six lowercase letters above, the computation results in 29 bits; for the more complex, 12-character example, it is 75 bits.(Mathematicians refer to the possibility spaces as having entropy of 29 and 75 bits, respectively.)The French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) recommends spaces having a minimum of 100 bits when it comes to passwords or secret keys for encryption systems that absolutely must be secure.Encryption involves representing data in a way that ensures it cannot be retrieved unless a recipient has a secret code-breaking key.In fact, the agency recommends a possibility space of 128 bits to guarantee security for several years.It considers 64 bits to be very small (very weak); 64 to 80 bits to be small; and 80 to 100 bits to be medium (moderately strong).Moores law (which says that the computer-processing power available at a certain price doubles roughly every two years) explains why a relatively weak password will not suffice for long-term use: over time computers using brute force can find passwords faster.Although the pace of Moores law appears to be decreasing, it is wise to take it into account for passwords that you hope will remain secure for a long time.For a truly strong password as defined by ANSSI, you would need, say, a sequence of 16 characters, each taken from a set of 200 characters.This would make a 123-bit space, which would render the password close to impossible to memorize.Therefore, system designers are generally less demanding and accept low- or medium-strength passwords.They insist on long ones only when the passwords are automatically generated by the system, and users do not have to remember them.There are other ways to guard against password cracking.The simplest is well known and used by credit cards: after three unsuccessful attempts, access is blocked.Alternative ideas have also been suggested, such as doubling the waiting time after each successive failed attempt but allowing the system to reset after a long period, such as 24 hours.These methods, however, are ineffective when an attacker is able to access the system without being detected or if the system cannot be configured to interrupt and disable failed attempts.How Long Does It Take to Search All Possible Passwords?For a password to be difficult to crack, it should be chosen randomly from a large set, or space, of possibilities.The size, T, of the possibility space is based on the length, A, of the list of valid characters in the password and the number of characters, N, in the password.The size of this space (T = AN) may vary considerably.Each of the following examples specifies values of A, N, T and the number of hours, D, that hackers would have to spend to try every permutation of characters one by one.X is the number of years that will have to pass before the space can be checked in less than one hour, assuming that Moores law (the doubling of computing capacity every two years) remains valid.I also assume that in 2019, a computer can explore a billion possibilities per second.I represent this set of assumptions with the following three relationships and consider five possibilities based on values of A and N: Relationships T = AN D = T/(109 3,600) X = 2 log 2 [T/(109 3,600)] Results _________________________________ If A = 26 and N = 6, then T = 308,915,776 D = 0.0000858 computing hour X = 0; it is already possible to crack all passwords in the space in under an hour _________________________________ If A = 26 and N = 12, then T = 9.5 1016 D = 26,508 computing hours X = 29 years before passwords can be cracked in under an hour _________________________________ If A = 100 and N = 10, then T = 1020 D = 27,777,777 computing hours X = 49 years before passwords can be cracked in under an hour _________________________________ If A = 100 and N = 15, then T = 1030 D = 2.7 1017 computing hours X = 115 years before passwords can be cracked in under an hour ________________________________ If A = 200 and N = 20, then T = 1.05 1046 D = 2.7 1033 computing hours X = 222 years before passwords can be cracked in under an hour Weaponizing Dictionaries and Other Hacker Tricks Quite often an attacker succeeds in obtaining encrypted passwords or password fingerprints (which I will discuss more fully later) from a system.If the hack has not been detected, the interloper may have days or even weeks to attempt to derive the actual passwords.To understand the subtle processes exploited in such cases, take another look at the possibility space.When I spoke earlier of bit size and password space (or entropy), I implicitly assumed that the user consistently chooses passwords at random.But typically the choice is not random: people tend to select a password they can remember (locomotive) rather than an arbitrary string of characters (xdichqewax).This practice poses a serious problem for security because it makes passwords vulnerable to so-called dictionary attacks.Lists of commonly used passwords have been collected and classified according to how frequently they are used.Attackers attempt to crack passwords by going through these lists systematically.This method works remarkably well because, in the absence of specific constraints, people naturally choose simple words, surnames, first names and short sentences, which considerably limits the possibilities.In other words, the nonrandom selection of passwords essentially reduces possibility space, which decreases the average number of attempts needed to uncover a password.Below are the first 25 entries in one of these password dictionaries, listed in order, starting with the most common one.(I took the examples from a database of five million passwords that was leaked in 2017 and analyzed by SplashData.)1.123456 2. password 3.12345678 4. qwerty 5.12345 6.123456789 7. letmein 8.1234567 9. football 10. iloveyou 11. admin 12. welcome 13. monkey 14. login 15. abc123 16. starwars 17.123123 18. dragon 19. passw0rd 20. master 21. hello 22. freedom 23. whatever 24. qazwsx 25. trustno1 If you use password or iloveyou, you are not as clever as you thought!Of course, lists differ according to the country where they are collected and the Web sites involved; they also vary over time.For four-digit passwords (for example, the PIN code of SIM cards on smartphones), the results are even less imaginative.In 2013, based on a collection of 3.4 million passwords each containing four digits, the DataGenetics Web site reported that the most commonly used four-digit sequence (representing 11 percent of choices) was 1234, followed by 1111 (6 percent) and 0000 (2 percent).The least-used four-digit password was 8068.Careful, though, this ranking may no longer be true now that the result has been published.The 8068 choice appeared only 25 times among the 3.4-million four-digit sequences in the database, which is much less than the 340 uses that would have occurred if each four-digit combination had been used with the same frequency.The first 20 series of four digits are: 1234; 1111; 0000; 1212; 7777; 1004; 2000; 4444; 2222; 6969; 9999; 3333; 5555; 6666; 1122; 1313; 8888; 4321; 2001; 1010.Even without a password dictionary, using differences in frequency of letter use (or double letters) in a language makes it possible to plan an effective attack.Some attack methods also take into account that, to facilitate memorization, people may choose passwords that have a certain structuresuch as A1=B2=C3, AwX2AwX2 or O0o.lli.(which I used for a long time)or that are derived by combining several simple strings, such as password123 or johnABC0000.Exploiting such regularities makes it possible to for hackers to speed up detection.Making Hash of Hackers As the main text explains, instead of storing clients passwords, Internet servers store the fingerprints of these passwords: sequences of characters that are derived from the passwords.In the event of an attack, the use of fingerprints can make it is very difficult, if not impossible, for hackers to use what they find.The transformation is achieved by using algorithms known as cryptographic hash functions.These are meticulously developed processes that transform a data file, F, however long it may be, into a sequence, h(F), called a fingerprint of F. For example, the hash function SHA256 transforms the phrase Nice weather into: DB0436DB78280F3B45C2E09654522197D59EC98E7E64AEB967A2A19EF7C394A3 (64 hexadecimal, or base 16, characters, which is equivalent to 256 bits) Changing a single character in the file completely alters its fingerprint.For example, if the first character of Nice weather is changed to lowercase (nice weather), the hash SHA256 will generate another fingerprint: 02C532E7418CD1B57961A1B090DB6EC37B3C58380AC0E6877F3B6155C974647E You can do these calculations yourself and check them at https://passwordsgenerator.net/sha256-hash-generator or www.xorbin.com/tools/sha256-hash-calculator Good hash functions produce fingerprints that are similar to those that would be obtained if the fingerprint sequence was uniformly chosen at random.In particular, for any possible random result (a sequence of 64 hexadecimal characters), it is impossible to find a data file F with this fingerprint in a reasonable amount of time.There have been several generations of hash functions.The SHA0 and SHA1 generations are obsolete and are not recommended.The SHA2 generation, including SHA256, is considered secure.The Take-Home for Consumers Taking all this into account, properly designed Web sites analyze the passwords proposed at the time of their creation and reject those that would be too easy to recover.It is irritating, but its for your own good.The obvious conclusion for users is that they must choose their passwords randomly.Some software does provide a random password.Be aware, however, that such password-generating software may, deliberately or not, use a poor pseudo-random generator, in which case what it provides may be imperfect.You can check whether any of your passwords has already been hacked by using a Web tool called Pwned Passwords (https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).Its database includes more than 500 million passwords obtained after various attacks.I tried e=mc2e=mc2, which I liked and believed to be secure, and received an unsettling response: This password has been seen 114 times before.Additional attempts show that it is difficult to come up with easy-to-memorize passwords that the database does not know.For example, aaaaaa appeared 395,299 times; a1b2c3d4, 113,550 times; abcdcba, 378 times; abczyx, 186 times; acegi, 117 times; clinton, 18,869 times; bush, 3,291 times; obama, 2,391 times; trump, 859 times.It is still possible to be original.The Web site did not recognize the following six passwords, for example: eyahaled (my name spelled backward); bizzzzard; meaudepace and modeuxpass (two puns on the French for password); abcdef2019; passwaurde.Now that Ive tried them, I wonder if the database will add them when it next updates.In that case, I wont use them.Advice for Web Sites Web sites, too, follow various rules of thumb.The National Institute of Standards and Technology recently published a notice recommending the use of dictionaries to filter users password choices.Among the rules that a good Web server designer absolutely must adhere to is, do not store plaintext lists of usernames and passwords on the computer used to operate the Web site.The reason is obvious: hackers could access the computer containing this list, either because the site is poorly protected or because the system or processor contains a serious flaw unknown to anyone except the attackers (a so-called zero-day flaw), who can exploit it.One alternative is to encrypt the passwords on the server: use a secret code that transforms them via an encryption key into what will appear to be random character sequences to anyone who does not possess the decryption key.This method works, but it has two disadvantages.First, it requires decrypting the stored password every time to compare it with the users entry, which is inconvenient.Second, and more seriously, the decryption necessary for this comparison requires storing the decryption key in the Web site computers memory.This key may therefore be detected by an attacker, which brings us back to the original problem.A better way to store passwords is through what are called hash functions that produce fingerprints.For any data in a filesymbolized as Fa hash function generates a fingerprint.(The process is also called condensing or hashing.)The fingerprinth(F)is a fairly short word associated with F but produced in such a way that, in practice, it is impossible to deduce F from h(F).Hash functions are said to be one-way: getting from F to h(F) is easy; getting from h(F) to F is practically impossible.In addition, the hash functions used have the characteristic that even if it is possible for two data inputs, F and F', to have the same fingerprint (known as a collision), in practice for a given F, it is almost impossible to find an F' with a fingerprint identical to F. Using such hash functions allows passwords to be securely stored on a computer.Instead of storing the list of paired usernames and passwords, the server stores only the list of username/fingerprint pairs.When a user wishes to connect, the server will read the individuals password, compute the fingerprint and determine whether it corresponds to the list of stored username/fingerprint pairs associated with that username.That maneuver frustrates hackers because even if they have managed to access the list, they will be unable to derive the users passwords, inasmuch as it is practically impossible to go from fingerprint to password.Nor can they generate another password with an identical fingerprint to fool the server because it is practically impossible to create collisions.Still, no approach is foolproof, as is highlighted by frequent reports of the hacking of major sites.In 2016, for example, data from a billion accounts were stolen from Yahoo!For added safety, a method known as salting is sometimes used to further impede hackers from exploiting stolen lists of username/fingerprint pairs.Salting is the addition of a unique random string of characters to each password.It ensures that even if two users employ the same password, the stored fingerprints will differ.The list on the server will contain three components for each user: username, fingerprint derived after salt was added to the password, and the salt itself.When the server checks the password entered by a user, it adds the salt, computes the fingerprint and compares the result with its database.Even when user passwords are weak, this method considerably complicates the hackers work.Without salting, a hacker can compute all the fingerprints in a dictionary and see those in the stolen data; all the passwords in the hackers dictionary can be identified.With salting, for every salt used, the hacker must compute the salted fingerprints of all the passwords in the hackers dictionary.For a set of 1,000 users, this multiplies by 1,000 the computations required to use the hackers dictionary.Survival of the Fittest It goes without saying that hackers have their own ways of fighting back.They face a dilemma, though: their simplest options either take a lot of computing power or a lot of memory.Often neither option is viable.There is, however, a compromise approach known as the rainbow table method (see Rainbow Tables Help Hackers).In the age of the Internet, supercomputers and computer networks, the science of password setting and cracking continues to evolveas does the relentless struggle between those who strive to protect passwords and those who are determined to steal, and potentially abuse, them.
Israeli Spacecraft Fails to Make First Private Lunar Landing:::::Beresheet, a modest Israeli spacecraft with the audacious aim of making a soft landing on the moon, came close but ultimately failed in its goal on Thursday.The probe crashed on the lunar surface after engine and communication troubles arose shortly before its planned touchdown.The vehicle, engineered by an Israeli nonprofit organization called SpaceIL, would have been the first private spacecraft to make a lunar landingand would have made Israel only the fourth country to do so, after the U.S., the former Soviet Union and China.Well, we didnt make it, but we definitely tried, said SpaceIL president Morris Kahn during a live broadcast of the landing attempt.I think the achievement of getting to where we got is really tremendous.I think we can be proud.The $100 million Beresheet spacecraft was not an Israeli government project but was instead funded, built and operated through SpaceILs efforts.It was the first of several privately funded lunar landing attempts slated for the next few yearspart of a potential new international moon rush, as both global powers and private companies race back to Earths nearest neighbor.I think everybody kind of realizes that this is a long shot, that this is a very challenging thing to go try to do, said Bruce Pittman, a contractor at NASA and senior vice president and senior operations officer for the National Space Society, before the landing attempt.These other teams are so far down the road, with so much momentumthey will all have their shot.They dont all have to work.Im just hoping that at least one of the near-term attempts, of the five to six that should happen over next 12 to 18 months, will be successful.Beresheets Beginning Beresheet is a biblical word, the Hebrew word for the book of Genesis, said SpaceIL co-founder Yonatan Winetraub in an earlier interview.It also means in the beginning.It was proposed by the public and selected by national [Israeli] vote.The naming captures the essence of the mission: a grassroots, bottom-up effort that is only the beginning.Although it launched in February, hitching a ride on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying an Indonesian communications satellite and a U.S. Air Force payload, Beresheets journey properly began one fateful night in 2010.That was when three young IsraelisWinetraub, Yariv Bash and Kfir Damarifirst pondered a private moon mission over beers in a bar outside Tel Aviv.The trio went on to found SpaceIL as way to compete for the Google Lunar XPRIZE, a contest that began in 2007.The contest had promised a first-prize purse of $20 million for the first private robotic lander to reach the moon and then complete a series of objectives, such as traversing 500 meters and sending back high-definition imagery.The three optimists decided they had a shot at winning.How little we knew then, Winetraub said.We were sitting in that bar in 2010, thinking about how amazing it would be to get to the moon.In 2011, after giving a short invited presentation to the Israel Space Agency, the SpaceIL founders were approached by someone who had been watching in the audience.This person came up to us and said, Do you have any money?and we just looked at each otherthe answer was obviously no, Winetraub recalled.He said, Come to my office; Ill give you a check for $100,000.He has given a lot more ever since.That person was Kahn, a billionaire Israeli entrepreneur who later became SpaceILs president.With Kahns help, the organization attracted additional hefty donations, such as a $16.4 million contribution from U.S. casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson.Aiming for the moon showcases Israels strongest abilities, Kahn said earlier.We dare to dreaminnovation, desire, curiosity and complexity are part of our DNA, and this project has them all.I want to get the younger generation excited about and interested in space, just like the Apollo program did for the United States.From the early days, that ethos has driven SpaceILs planning, which, its members say, has been centered around education and outreach rather than turning a profit.The 1.5-meter-tall Beresheet carried a small time capsule of cultural artifacts for long-term preservation on the near-static lunar surface.It also had NASA-supplied laser retroreflectors, which can be used by other spacecraft in or near lunar orbit for precise ranging and metrology.On Beresheets way down to the surface, a magnetometer built by the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, was intended to scan the desolate terrain below, gathering new data about the landscapes magnetic field that could help unveil the moons deepest origins and history.The Race Continues Ultimately SpaceILand all its competitorsfailed to win the Google Lunar XPRIZE: the competition was canceled last year after no one succeeded within the deadline (originally 2014, and later pushed to 2018).Although it never awarded the $20 million, the XPRIZE stimulated a sizable private moon race and gave out smaller prizes worth more than $5 million along the way.We are proud that the Google Lunar XPRIZE, though it went unclaimed, stimulated a diversity of teams from around the world to pursue, and continue to pursue, such ambitious plans that were deemed impossible when we first launched this competition, said Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, the XPRIZE Foundations vice president of prize operations.Several former XPRIZE competitors remain dedicated to sending their own robotic landers to the moon in the near future, most notably the U.S.-based Astrobotic and Moon Express teams, as well as the Japanese company ispace.SpaceX is planning to fly a Japanese artist and eight additional crew members around the moon in the companys Dragon capsule as early as 2023, and another aerospace upstart, Blue Origin, is in the midst of developing a heavy-duty lunar lander.In the loftier realm of nation-states, the U.S., Europe, China, Russia, India, Japan and South Korea all have burgeoning lunar exploration programs supported by generous contracts with major aerospace companies.(SpaceIL, for its part, has partnered with Israel Aerospace Industries to produce near-clones of Beresheet for customers interested in potential future interplanetary forays.)Were going through a paradigm shift in aerospace, Pittman said.Whats so exciting and frightening to a lot of people is the rules of the game are changing dramatically.The standard way you did thingsgovernment leads, industry followsall those rules are fundamentally changing, and I personally think thats a really great thing.
Philippine Fossils Add Surprising New Species to Human Family Tree:::::The human family tree just got a little more luxuriant and a lot more interesting.Scientists say fossils discovered in a cave on the island of Luzon in the Philippines represent a previously unknown branch of humanity, a species they call Homo luzonensis.The remains reveal a tiny variety of human with a number of startlingly primitive traits that lived as recently as 50,000 to 67,000 years ago, overlapping in time with our own species, Homo sapiens, as well as other hominins (members of the human family) including the Neandertals, Denisovans and Homo floresiensis.The find raises important questions about early hominin evolution and biogeography, and highlights just how much of human prehistory remains to be discovered.The discovery of H. luzonensis has been years in the making.The first hint of it surfaced in 2007 when archaeologists digging in Callao Cave, a popular tourist attraction on Luzon, recovered a single fossil foot bone.The bone was clearly petite, comparable in size to the foot bones of the small-bodied Negrito people who live on Luzon today.Yet its shape was really weird, recalls paleoanthropologist Florent Dtroit of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris.Dtroit suspected that the fossil specimen came from something more interesting than a small Homo sapiens, he says.But with only a single bone to go on, he could not make a compelling case for that interpretation.So when he and his colleagues published their description of the foot bone in 2010, they concluded only that it belonged in the genus Homo.Which species it came from remained uncertain.Toe bone of Homo luzonensis is curved, a trait associated with climbing.Credit: Callao Cave Archaeology Project Over the next few years the researchers returned to the cave to look for more bones.They hit pay dirt, recovering 12 additional fossilsassorted teeth as well as hand and foot bonesfor a total of 13 specimens representing at least three individuals.Detroit and his collaborators describe the new fossils in a paper published in the April 11 Nature.One of a Kind The fossils exhibit a mosaic of so-called primitive and derived characteristics.The primitive aspects call to mind our ancient ancestors such as Australopithecus afarensis, the species to which the famous 3.1-million-year-old Lucy skeleton belongs; the derived ones resemble H. sapiens.Looking at the teeth, for example, the premolars of H. luzonensis are large and one of them has an extra tooth rootprimitive features.The molars, in contrast, are very small and strikingly modern.Together those dental traits are a very special combination that doesnt exist in any of the comparative samples we studied, Dtroit observes.Still, the teeth alone would not be enough to justify naming a new species, explains Mara Martinn-Torres of the National Research Center on Human Evolution in Spain.The key thing, she says, is the combination of these teeth with those hands and feet.Intriguingly, the hands and feet of H. luzonensis are quite primitive, with curved finger and toe bones, which are typically seen in species that climb trees.Although people today can and do climb trees, humans lost most of their adaptations to arboreality after ditching life in the trees life for life on the ground millions of years ago.So a human ancestor from 67,000 years ago or later with climbing anatomy is unexpected, to say the least.Considering the teeth and hand and foot bones together, I agree with the authors that the combination of features is like nothing we have seen before, Martinn-Torres says.How on earth did H. luzonensis end up with this unique mix of traits?This is the million-dollar question.Identifying the ancestor(s) of H. luzonensis is impossible at this stage.Stone tools and butchered animal bones from another site on the island hint that humans of some sort inhabited Luzon more than 700,000 years ago.But in the absence of any bones of the ancient butchers themselves, whether they might have been H. luzonensis or forerunners of H. luzonensis is unknown.The only other hominin fossils from the Philippines are 30,000-year-old bones of H. sapiens found on Palawan island,some ofwhich are small, but they lack the primitive features seen in H. luzonensis.Other human ancestors are known to have lived elsewhere in eastern Asia at around the same time as H. luzonensis, but the fossil evidence is insufficient to connect the Luzon hominins to any of these other groups.And attempts to extract DNA from the fossilswhich could shed light on the origin of H. luzonensis and how it is related to other members of the human familyhave failed.Excavations in Callao Cave, a popular tourist attraction on Luzon, have yielded fossils of H. luzonensis and some butchered animal bones, but no stone tools.Credit: Callao Cave Archaeology Project Unclear Origins Experts are entertaining speculative ideas about the origin of H. luzonensis, each of which would revise the story of human origins in important ways if borne out by further evidence.To fully appreciate the the potential impact of these explanations, however, we have to first revisit a find from 15 years ago.In 2004 scientists working on the island of Flores in Indonesia unveiled an astonishing discovery: remains of a miniature human with a small brain and a host of other primitive traits that, like H. luzonensis, lived until relatively recently.The bones were said to represent a previously unknown member of the human family, Homo floresiensis, which was promptly nicknamed the hobbit species after J.R.R.Tolkiens diminutive characters.Researchers put forth two evolutionary scenarios to explain the hobbits striking characteristics.In the first, H. floresiensis descended from large-bodied, large-brained Homo erectus and evolved its small size as an adaptation to the limited food resources available on the islanda phenomenon known as island dwarfing.Alternatively, H. floresiensis inherited its small proportions and other out-of-time features from a more primitive ancestoran australopithecine of some sortthat somehow managed to disperse from Africa into Asia.Both possibilities flouted entrenched ideas about human evolution.Although other large mammals are known to follow the island dwarfing rule, humans were traditionally thought to be exempt, the idea being that the ability to invent cultural solutions to lifes challenges has buffered humans from many of the environmental forces that have shaped other animals.And australopithecine fossils have never been found outside Africathe oldest known members of the human family found beyond the mother continent all belong to Homo.(A handful of skeptics proposed that the Flores bones instead came from a modern human with a disease that affected its growth, but no disorder proposed thus far can account for the hobbits suite of features.)Similar evolutionary scenarios could explain the Luzon fossils.Given the recent increase in the number of small-bodied, late-surviving [human species] that show many australopith-like features, I think we need to reevaluate whether all of this material should be classified as Homo, says Tracy Kivell, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Kent in England.In addition to H. luzonensis and H. floresiensis, a small human ancestor from South Africa called Homo naledi, announced in 2015,falls into this category.(Like H. luzonensis, H. naledi also has curved fingers indicative of climbing.)With all of the new, weird and wonderful discoveries lately, I wouldn't rule out that more primitive hominins made it out of Africa and that the small-bodied Homo species with australopith-like features have evolved from something more primitive, Kivell remarks.Alternatively, a large-bodied ancestor like Homo erectus might have colonized multiple islands in southeast Asia and undergone dwarfing in each locale.Differences between dwarfed species could reflect adaptations to local conditions.For instance, H. luzonensis appears to have lived in a forested environment that might have favored climbing ability.Another potential factor bears mention.DNA studies have shown that human groups including H. sapiens, Neandertals and Denisovans interbred from time to time.In theory, similar mixing could have contributed to the mosaic of traits found in the fossils from Callao Cave, according to biological anthropologist Rebecca Ackermann of the University of Cape Town.Certain aspects of the premolars in particular may be consistent with hybridization, though she cautions that it is not possible given the available evidence from known hybrids to establish definitively that hybridization occurred in this case.Island Explorers In part because of the evidence for gene flow between human groups during this time period, as well as the lack of comparative material from this region, Ackermann does not support the new species designation for the Luzon fossils.I actually feel quite strongly that all this species naming is missing the point, she contends.The real significance of the Luzon discovery, she says, is that it illustrates the extreme diversity of human ancestors during the last few hundred thousand yearsthe result of their having populated a huge range of contexts under the influence of various evolutionary forces.Which brings us to another burning question about H. luzonensis: how did it end up on Luzon in the first place?Luzon is surrounded by deep water.Even during times of lower sea levels, getting to the island would still have required crossing a daunting expanse of open ocean.Researchers grappled with the same problem when H. floresiensis first came to light.Like Luzon, Flores is a deep-water island.Some experts proposed that the hobbits must have had boats to make the journey.Yet the hobbits brain was only about the size of a chimpanzees and its stone tools were relatively simplenot what one might expect of a species that could make boats.Others suggested that the hobbits or their ancestors were swept out to sea during a big storm or tsunami and washed up on Flores, perhaps hitching a ride on drifting mats of vegetationa stroke of incredibly good luck.With only H. floresiensis to go on, the issue remained unresolved.But with the discovery of H. luzonensis there are now two primitive hominin species on record that inhabited two different deep-water islands in Southeast Asia during the late Pleistocene (the period between 126,000 and 12,000 years ago), which changes the equation.One strange event may be luck; two suggest something more interesting, asserts John Hawks, an anthropologist at the University of WisconsinMadison.What is more, he says, there is good archaeological evidence (though no fossils) of hominins on Sulawesianother Indonesian island surrounded by deep waterwell before modern humans were in the region.These hominins were crossing water barriers.We dont know how regular it was, but I have to think that each successful population is a survivor of many possibly unsuccessful attempts.The big-picture lesson here is that these early ancestors were much more adaptable than we used to give them credit for, Hawks says.They were smart, they learned from each other, and they transmitted traditions that helped them quickly adapt to new ecologies.
Tests on Astronaut and Twin Brother Highlight Spaceflight’s Human Impact:::::In a landmark study, NASA scientists conducted exhaustive tests on Scott Kelly during his grueling 342-day tour aboard the International Space Station in 20152016.And they simultaneously monitored his identical twin brother Mark (a retired astronaut who was on Earth at the time), hoping the comparison would reveal new information about the effects of long-term spaceflight on the human body.The results of the NASA Twins Study, reported Thursday in Science, show Scott Kelly underwent a number of physiological changesmost of which returned to pre-flight status after he returned to Earth.The findings could help inform preparations for future long-term missions, such as travel to Mars or stints on a moon-orbiting space station.The study was the first to integrate both behavioral analysis and physiology to investigate how space influences a person, and the first to collect two years of such comprehensive health data on a middle-aged Earthbound man, says co-author Brinda Rana, a molecular geneticist at University of California, San Diego.[This is] science at its best, in many ways, because it is leveraging something that is naturally occurring to try and understand causality, says behavioral geneticist S. Alexandra Burt, who co-directs the Michigan State University Twin Registry and was not involved in the study.I think this was a unique event and they capitalized on it beautifully.Kelly says he initially proposed the study while preparing for the ISS mission.I said, Hey, if anyone asks about any studies planned with my brother Mark and I, because were identical twins, is there any interest in that?he says.He was initially rebuffed, but he says NASA scientists eventually spoke to several universities and they found out there was actually a lot of interest.The Twins Study was a go.For nearly two years both brothers provided urine, stool and blood samples, which researchers used for 10 separate investigations involving the molecular, physiological and cognitive effects of long-term spaceflight.Close coordination among the many investigators was essential.NASA got 10 investigators from around the countrymost of whom didnt know each otherand put us in a room and got us to all cooperate and become a cohesive team to carry out this mission, Rana says.The inherent difficulties of collecting such specimens from an astronaut aboard the ISS meant the investigators had to work with relatively scant material.We had to come up with protocols where we could all do our studies effectively with one sample, Rana says.The study also spurred researchers to innovate new methods for studying physiology and genetics in space.Its helped us drive technology to do these sorts of experiments not just for low-Earth orbit, but for future activities [such as] exploration missions, says co-author Stuart Lee, a cardiovascular scientist at KBRwyle.Kelly had to draw his own blood and collect his own urine and stool.Certainly its more complicated to pee in a bag in space, because everything floats, he notes.But most importantly, it takes time.Astronauts sometimes find themselves almost subconsciously trying not to be as hydrated on urine collection days because of the time it takes to pee.This was reflected in the results: researchers found Kelly was consistently mildly dehydrated, a common phenomenon among astronauts on long-term missionsand scientists do in fact attribute this to astronauts annoyance with the complicated onboard lavatory.The study found Kelly was under near-constant physiological stress while in flight.His immune system was on high alert; he had changes in DNA expression; his carotid artery became distended.He also developed spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, or SANSa condition that involves changes to his eyes, and for which the cause is poorly understood.And his blood, no longer drawn to his legs by gravity, collected in his head.In the beginning, its the worst, Kelly says.Your body adjusts to it over time, but in my experience, it never adjusts completely.I always felt pressure in my head.While in flight, Kellys telomeresthe protective sequences of repeating nucleotides that cap the ends of each chromosome like aglets on a shoelacegrew longer.That certainly was a surprise, because going into the study we had proposed exactly the opposite, says Susan Bailey, a biologist at Colorado State University who directed the studys telomere investigation.Telomeres shorten as we age, and an enzyme called telomerase repairs and lengthens them.Astronauts are exposed to extreme stresses of microgravity, isolation and radiation that should contribute to telomere shortening, Bailey says.She suspects Kellys highly regimented diet and exercise program aboard the ISS may have contributed to the lengtheningor that the phenomenon may indicate his cell population was changing during spaceflight.Going forward, I think we will try to incorporate these telomere endpoints into some of the standard measurements that theyre doing on the astronauts, so that we could actually address that question directly, she says.After Kelly returned to Earth, most of the physiological, gene expression and other changes returned to normal within about six months.But there was still a period of adjustment.When you get back to Earth all the blood just wants to pool in your legs, he says.That lasted for me for weeks.He also developed rashes and hives whenever his skin, which had grown unaccustomed to gravity, had any pressure on it.Even leaning on a table caused a reaction.But he did eventually readjust, a hopeful sign there may be little lasting danger to astronauts health after long periods in space.That said, it is important to note that traveling to Mars or other long-distance explorations presents an additional concern: radiation.Astronauts aboard the ISS are still somewhat protected from cosmic rays by the Earths magnetic shield; a Mars mission would expose them to galactic radiation at much higher levels, Lee says.The study authors caution that given the extremely small sample size, it is impossible to attribute causality.They write that the study should be hypothesis-generating and framework-defining, with future research on astronauts complementing the work.Thats all true, Burt says.But she adds that having a genetically identical subject back on Earth allows for assuming causality much more strongly than the study otherwise could have.Kelly agrees: Granted, this is an experiment with an n of one, he says.But they didnt see anything that would prevent us from going to Mars.However, he adds, if were going to go beyond Marsrequiring astronauts to stay in microgravity for years on endwere going to have to start thinking about artificial gravity.
Environment Watchdogs Harness AI to Track Overflowing Factory-Farm Waste:::::When Hurricane Florence struck North Carolina last fall, floodwaters swamped vast stretches of farmland and graphically demonstrated a threat this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to: massive volumes of animal waste overflowing into waterways.North Carolina has one of the worlds largest concentrations of industrial pig farms, with more than 2,000 operations involving a total of about 10 million hogs.Most store manure in open-air pits called lagoons, and when these overflow they can contaminate waterways with pathogens, pharmaceuticals and nutrients that pose serious pollution and health risks.Environmental watchdogs are on the frontlines of monitoring such overflow events and tracking the damage, both in North Carolina and from other livestock and poultry farms around the country.But first they need to actually find the industrial farmsmany of which are not legally required to make their locations publicly available.This forces would-be monitors to manually pick out farms from satellite and aerial imagerya task that can take months (or, in the case of one state agency in Iowa, longer than three years) to complete.But researchers at Stanford University have found a way to pinpoint these farms in a fraction of that time, by using machine learning to train a computer model to identify them.We realized this was exactly the kind of place where we could leverage the really rapid advancements in computer vision, says Stanford law professor Daniel Ho, who co-authored a new paper on the technique, published in Nature Sustainability this week.Ho and his team focused on farms called concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs).These are defined as containing more than 1,000 beef cattle, 2,500 pigs or 125,000 broiler chickens for more than 45 days.CAFOs across the country churn out roughly 335 billion tons of manure each yearbut they are not required to treat it in the same way that jurisdictions and homes must treat human waste.When a single CAFO can produce as much manure [fecal waste] as a medium-sized city, Ho says, how do we ensure that the waterways of the United States are protected?The federal government does regulate effluent discharge from CAFOsup to a point.The Environmental Protection Agency requires these operations to obtain discharge permits, which limit the quantity of waste and areas where CAFOs can legally discharge it, but these limits only apply to operations that actively release effluent into waterways.Some farmers say such rules are enough to protect waterways.The EPAs charge is to protect the waters of the U.S. to make sure they are safe for drinking and recreating in, says Paul Bredwell, vice president of environmental protection with the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association in Tucker, Ga.If the EPA is satisfied with their regulations, then certainly we feel as though, if we adhere to those regulations, then [farmers] are going to do their job in protecting the environment.But some environmental groups argue that the EPA standards are too lax, in part because they do not account for unforeseen overflow events during storms like Hurricane Florence.This has motivated these groups to seek more stringent regulation and oversight, Ho says.The first step is locating the farms.To train a computer model to help, Ho and his team compiled 24,440 publicly available satellite images from a study area across North Carolina.A crew of students helped the team manually sift through these photos for the hallmark features of CAFOs, such as clusters of long, narrow buildings and, in the case of hog farms, open-air lagoons (many North Carolina poultry farms do not have such lagoons because they store waste indoors).The team also identified similar-looking facilities the computer might mistake for CAFOs.Examples included airplane hangars, which are also often clustered together but tend to sit amid concrete runways rather than agricultural land, Ho explains.Once the researchers fully trained the model to distinguish CAFOs, the team demonstrated that computer vision could successfully identify 95 percent of the CAFOs that a manual survey had foundbut in less than one tenth the time.Thats something we would strongly considering investing in, say Soren Rundquist, director of spatial analysis at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group (EWG) in Washington, D.C. Rundquist contributed imagery and guidance to Hos team but was not an author on the new study.He has conducted extensive manual surveys of CAFOs for his work with EWG, and knows firsthand how time-consuming that task can be.Allowing a computer to guide you where to look and manually validating the computers results will definitely help streamline the process, he says.Rundquist also notes this will be especially valuable as CAFOs continue to rapidly proliferate, creating a moving target for environmental groups monitoring efforts.Still, Rundquist notes this technology is relatively young and will need fine-tuning to capture the nuances of different CAFO designs, especially in other parts of the country.For example, hog CAFOs in the Midwest generally lack the outdoor manure lagoons typical of those in North Carolina, so the model would need to undergo region-specific training.Rundquist also notes that most nonprofit environmental organizations would probably not have the capacity to deploy the technology on their own, at least in the short term.The software requires a level of familiarity with coding that academic groups may have, but nonprofits may not.They would likely need to work together, at least in the technologys initial phase, Ho says.At this early stage the method also would not completely eliminate the human element in identifying farm locations.People would still need to manually confirm the accuracy of the computer models results.But the program does offer a helpful launching point to speed up that process.We view it as a first step, Ho says, to show how machine learning can be a viable and cost-effective complement to human monitoring efforts.
An Exit Chute from the Universe: The Story of a Historic Effort to Image a Black Hole:::::It actually worked.The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has always sounded like an unlikely proposition: create a virtual Earth-size telescope to take a picture of the shadow of a black hole.Every piece of that sentence is a little bit insane.But it worked.After more than a decade of technical development and fundraising and astronomer-herding and telescope-wrangling, the astronomers of the EHT unveiled the first picture of a black holea bubble of pure gravity, a hole in spacetime, a prediction of general relativity so strange that Albert Einstein himself long refused to believe the concept was possible.In six simultaneous press conferences on four continents, astronomers lit up projection screens with an image that, for experts at least, is unmistakable: a dark circle surrounded by a ring of light and lopsided fiery blobs, clumps of matter heated to 100 million degrees and circling the black hole at close to the speed of light.Technically, this is a picture of the shadow of a black hole: specifically, a supermassive black holea 6.5-billion-solar-mass beast 55 million light years from Earthat the center of the galaxy Messier 87.Black holes trap everything that falls in, including light, which is why they are black.In a sense, they are fundamentally unseeable, one-way cosmic escape hatches leading to well, that part is unclear.But because of the way they warp spacetime, they impose a dark silhouette on the glowing, superheated matter that circles them.This is the barely imaginable scene the EHT captured during an observing run two years ago, and revealed to the world today.Since the 1960s, when indirect astronomical evidence and breakthroughs in theoretical physics made the existence of black holes all but undeniable, these objects have been in a sort of epistemological limbo: they were the most likely explanation for all sorts of otherwise inexplicable phenomena, but no one held out much hope of ever seeing one.That changed in the late 1990s, when astronomers around the world began building powerful high-frequency radio observatories on high ground in Hawaii, Mexico, Chile and the South Pole.Theoretical astrophysicists calculated that, in theory, uniting these telescopes using a technique called Very Long Baseline Interferometry would allow them to see the shadows of supermassive black holes that were sufficiently huge and close to Earth.The biggest prize has always been Sagittarius A*, the four-million solar-mass black hole at the center of the Milky Way.Sagittarius A* remains unseenat least by the public.But M87, the only other known black hole within the EHTs grasp, has now been captured.Usually big scientific discoveries like this leak early, but this time the astronomers kept surprisingly tight control.France Crdova, the director of the National Science Foundationwhich invested $28 million in the EHT over the yearssaw the image for the first time at this mornings press conference.It moved her to tears.The NSF and other funding institutions promised that todays result would be groundbreaking, and it certainly wasthe first direct evidence for the existence of event horizons, the defining feature of a black hole.But anyone hoping that this first image would chip away at Einsteins iron-clad theory of general relativity came away disappointed: the black hole looks pretty much exactly like the century-old theory says it should.But this first picture is only a start.Since the 2017 observation, the EHT array has already grown in size and acuity, with a new telescope joining and another on the way, and with the installation of ever-more-powerful digital signal processing hardware at each site.As Sera Markoff, an astrophysicist with the University of Amsterdam, said at this mornings press conference, in the future all sorts of other telescopes will join the EHT to observe M87, Sagittarius A* and other black holes simultaneously in many different bands of lightradio, x-ray, gamma ray, infrared and optical.It is also worth noting that in the two hours after the press conference, at least six scientific papers on the observation have appeared online.They almost certainly contain clues and new questions that will take more time to process than a 24/7 news cycle can tolerate.For now, though, it is worth pausing for a moment to consider the strangeness of nature, and the remarkable fact that these sentient, tool-using bipeds on a small world in a backwater solar system somehow managed to turn their planet into a telescope and take a picture of an exit chute from the universe.
At Last, a Black Hole’s Image Revealed:::::At six simultaneous press conferences around the globe, astronomers on Wednesday announced they had accomplished the seemingly impossible: taking a picture of a black hole, a cosmic monster so voracious that light itself cannot escape its clutches.This historic feat, performed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)a planet-spanning network of radio observatoriesrequired more than a decade of effort.The projects name refers to a black holes most defining characteristic, an event horizon set by the objects mass and spin beyond which no infalling material, including light, can ever return.We have taken the first picture of a black hole, the EHT projects director, Sheperd Doeleman, said in a news release.This is an extraordinary scientific feat accomplished by a team of more than 200 researchers.The image unveils the shadowy face of a 6.5-billion-solar-mass supermassive black hole at the core of Messier 87 (M87), a large galaxy some 55 million light-years from Earth in the Virgo galaxy cluster.Such objects are a reflection of Einsteins theory of general relativity, which predicts that only so much material can be squeezed into any given volume before the overwhelming force of its accumulated gravity causes a collapsea warp in the fabric of spacetime that swallows itself.Left behind is an almost featureless nothingness that, for lack of better terms, scientists simply call a black hole.Once thought to be figments of theorists wildest imaginings, black holes are now known to be crucial arbiters of cosmic structure, profoundly affecting the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies across the universe.The one in M87, for instance, is devouring a whirling accretion disk of material, which just outside the event horizon powers a star-scouring jet of intense radiation and relativistic particles blasting some 5,000 light-years out from the galaxys core.Analyses of the imagepublished in a series of six papers in the Astrophysical Journal Lettersconfirm that within the limits of the EHTs present sensitivity the shape and behavior of M87s black hole fits Einsteins predictions.If immersed in a bright region, like a disc of glowing gas, we expect a black hole to create a dark region similar to a shadowsomething predicted by Einsteins general relativity that weve never seen before, read a statement released by Heino Falcke, chair of the EHT Science Council.This shadow, caused by the gravitational bending and capture of light by the event horizon, reveals a lot about the nature of these fascinating objects and allowed us to measure the enormous mass of M87s black hole.But the best is yet to come; the EHT is planned to operate indefinitely and has also targeted the Milky Ways central supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*, in hopes of imaging our nearest, most familiar cosmic monster.Those results, project leaders say, will emerge from behind their own veil of secrecy in the future.
“Hyperscans” Show How Brains Sync as People Interact:::::The vast majority of neuroscientific studies contain three elements: a person, a cognitive task and a high-tech machine capable of seeing inside the brain.That simple recipe can produce powerful science.Such studies now routinely yield images that a neuroscientist used to only dream about.They allow researchers to delineate the complex neural machinery that makes sense of sights and sounds, processes language and derives meaning from experience.But something has been largely missing from these studies: other people.We humans are innately social, yet even social neuroscience, a field explicitly created to explore the neurobiology of human interaction, has not been as social as you would think.Just one example: no one has yet captured the rich complexity of two peoples brain activity as they talk together.We spend our lives having conversation with each other and forging these bonds, neuroscientist Thalia Wheatley of Dartmouth College says.[Yet] we have very little understanding of how it is people actually connect.We know almost nothing about how minds couple.Group Brainprints That is beginning to change.A growing cadre of neuroscientists is using sophisticated technologyand some very complicated mathto capture what happens in one brain, two brains, or even 12 or 15 at a time when their owners are engaged in eye contact, storytelling, joint attention focused on a topic or object, or any other activity that requires social give and take.Although the field of interactive social neuroscience is in its infancy, the hope remains that identifying the neural underpinnings of real social exchange will change our basic understanding of communication and ultimately improve education or inform treatment of the many psychiatric disorders that involve social impairments.Previous limits on technology were a major obstacle to studying real human interaction.Brain imaging requires stillness, and scientific rigor demands a level of experimental control that is anything but natural.As a result, it is hard to generate high-quality data about one brain.Doing so for two brains is more than twice as hard, neuroscientist David Poeppel of New York University says.You have to synchronize the machinery, the data and the data acquisition.Nevertheless, the first study to successfully monitor two brains at the same time took place nearly 20 years ago.Physicist Read Montague, now at Virginia Tech, and his colleagues put two people in separate functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machines and observed their brain activity as they engaged in a simple competitive game in which one player (the sender) transmitted a signal about whether he or she had just seen the color red or green and the other player (the receiver) had to decide if the sender was telling the truth or lying.Correct guesses resulted in rewards.Montague called the technique hyperscanning, and his work proved it was possible to observe two brains at once.Initially, Montagues lead was followed mostly by other neuroeconomists rather than social neuroscientists.But the term hyperscanning is now applied to any brain imaging research that involves more than one person.Today the techniques that fit the bill include electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography and functional near-infrared spectroscopy.Use of these varied techniques, many of them quite new, has broadened the range of possible experiments and made hyperscanning less cumbersome and, as a consequence, much more popular.Engagement Matters Beyond the practical challenges of interactive neuroscience, a more philosophical question has circulated as to whether the neural information obtained from measuring people during social interaction is significantly different from scans taken when people are alone or acting simply as observers.Does it matter if the person you look at looks back?Is there a difference between speaking a sentence and speaking it to someone who is listening?Yes, apparently there is.The evidence is growing, says psychiatrist and social neuroscientist Leonhard Schilbach of the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry in Munich, that social cognition is fundamentally different when youre directly engaged with another person as opposed to observing another person.Demonstrating those differences does not necessarily require studies of more than one brain at a time, but it does require relatively naturalistic experiments that are challenging to design within the constraints imposed on standard laboratory protocols.Psychologist Elizabeth Redcay of the University of Maryland studies social interaction in autism, with a focus on middle childhood.Back in 2010, when she was a postdoctoral fellow working with Rebecca Saxe at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Redcay set up a pioneering experiment featuring one participant inside the scanner and another (actually a researcher) outside it interacting live through a video feed.Recorded videos of another interlocutor served as a control.In the live versus the recorded interactions, Redcay saw greater activation in brain areas involved in social cognition and reward.Her subsequent studies have continued to establish differences in the way the interacting brain responds.In childrens brains, more of the regions involved in thinking about the mental states of othersmentalizing, in the vernacularare engaged when they believe they are interacting with a peer than when they are not.In studies of joint attention, a critical component of social interaction, Redcay found that the mentalizing regions of the brain such as the temporal parietal junction responded differently when sharing attention rather than when looking at something by oneself.Now she wants to know if there are further differences in how the brains of individuals with autism interact.Is the extent to which people engage those mentalizing regions related to their successes in a social interaction?she wonders.It is too soon to say, but clearly, says Redcay, youre not getting the full story if you just rely on observer approaches.Schilbach has been one of the foremost proponents of what he calls second-person neuroscience.His studies have included virtual characters who seem to respond to a participants gaze.In such situations, the so-called mentalizing network and the action-observation network seem to be much more closely connected [than we knew], Schilbach says.They influence each other, sometimes in a complementary and sometimes in an inhibitory fashion.Schilbach has also found that even very simple acts such as gazing at another individual and believing they are gazing backan interaction in which you sense that your own behavior has an effect on another personspurs activity in the brains reward circuitry, particularly the ventral striatum.And the more rewarding we find a behavior, the more likely we are to repeat it.The Eyes Have It What is happening in the other persons brain?Eye contact was a logical place to look.Making eye contact activates the social brain and signals to another person that you are paying attention.It is one way we share intention and emotion.Norihiro Sadato of the National Institute for Physiological Sciences in Japan and his colleagues used hyperscanning to show, early in 2019, that eye contact prepares the social brain to empathize by activating the same areas of each persons brain simultaneously: the cerebellum, which helps predict the sensory consequences of actions, and the limbic mirror system, a set of brain areas that become active both when we move any part of the body (including the eyes) and when we observe someone elses movements.The limbic system, in general, underlies our ability to recognize and share emotion.In other words, it is critical to regulating our capacity for empathy.The tales we tell each other are an ideal means of exploring the social glue that binds.Neuroscientist Uri Hasson of Princeton University conducted seminal experiments in brain coupling by using storytelling.In one such study, he put an individual in a scanner and had that person tell a story.Then he put someone new in the scanner and had the volunteer listen to a recording of the story told by the first person.Hasson compared the brain processing of speaker and listener across time, matching activity moment by moment, and he found evidence of the two brains coupling.The brain of the listener becomes similar to the brain of the speaker, Hasson says.And the more aligned the brains were, the greater the listeners reported comprehension.Says Hasson, Your brain as an individual is really determined by the brains youre connected to.Hasson has recently joined forces with Dartmouths Wheatley to see if they can measure brains coupling during conversation.A good conversation, says Wheatley, means creating new ideas together and experiences you couldn't have gotten to alone.She wants to see that experience in the brain.Their study includes scanners at different universities connected online.(Most psychology departments only have one scanner.)With one person in each scanner, the subjects complete a story taking turnsone participant utters a few sentences, and the other picks up where the companion left off.If the scientists can capture brain states during this interaction, Wheatley says, they might be able to see how two brains alternately get closer and then move apart from each other during conversation.Beyond Pairs Perhaps inevitably, neuroscientists have moved to studying not just two, but many brains at once.These experiments require the use of EEG because it is portable.Early studies showed that when we engage in group activities like concerts or movies, our brain waves become synchronizedthe audiences rapt attention means they process the symphonic finale or a love or fight scene in the same way.That is not all that surprising, but now scientists are applying the same approach in classrooms, where the findings could add to what we know about how students learn best.In a series of studies in New York City high schools, a team of New York University researchers including Poeppel, Suzanne Dikker and Ido Davidesco took repeated EEG recordings from every student in a biology class over the course of a semester.They found that students brainwaves are more in sync with each other when they are more engaged in class.Brain-to-brain synchrony also reflects how much students like each other and the teachercloser relationships lead to more synchronization.Their current study is examining whether levels of brain synchrony during class predict retention of material learned.I think what were doing is very useful, Poeppel says.How [do we] use these techniques in a targeted way for STEM learning?Schilbach believes interactive neuroscience has real-life applications in psychiatry as well.It could make it possible to predict which therapist will work best with which patient, for example.And the focus on real-life situations helps ensure that any findings have value for patients.As a psychiatrist, Schilbach says, Im not interested in helping a person to get better on a particular social cognitive task.Im trying to help that person to lead a happy and satisfying life.
A Geological “Orrery” Could Reveal Planetary Dynamics in Deep Time:::::The Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory comprises about a dozen small buildings nestled among pine trees in the Palisades, 15 miles north of Manhattan.On the second floor of the observatorys geoscience building, the shelves lining Columbia University paleontologist Paul Olsens labyrinthine office sag under the weight of hundreds of books about dinosaurs: The Dinosaur Data Book, The Ultimate Dinosaur, Dinosauri In Italia.Olsen has been studying them since he was a teenager.His first paleontological achievement came while he was still in high school.Almost single-handedly, Olsen convinced the Nixon administration to designate a site where dinosaur footprints had been discovered as a National Natural Landmark.Now a professor with a shock of white hair and a mustache he strokes absently when considering how to explain a complex point, Olsen leads the way past towering racks of geological samples to a corner of a cavernous walk-in refrigerator.Here, graduate student Sean Kinney unpacks slim cardboard boxes to reveal a collection of stone cylinders, each about three feet long and four inches in diameter.They are delicately layered: some are cadet gray and marbled with white bands, while others are shades of caramel and auburn.These are sediment cores.Drilled from ancient lake beds, each three-foot segment represents about five millennia of Earths history.Together with hundreds of others like them, they make up the Geological Orrery.Olsen is fond of saying geologists look at the rock record to discover things about the Earth we cannot learn any other way.With the orrery, he uses sedimentary records to reckon the orbital positions of the Earth and other planets more than 200 million years ago.The method is unprecedented: counterintuitively, Olsen digs down to look up.In the case of the Earths history, you need a lot of observations to see what the patterns are before you can derive a hypothesis, Olsen says.The world's too complicated to derive a hypothesis from a series of assumptions and deduce what it must be.And with complex dynamical systems like the solar system, you cant.There is no analytical solution to the solar system problem, period.You need empirical information.Olsen published the orrerys preliminary resultssome 24 million years worth of empirical datain Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in January.An orrery, like many scientific instruments invented during the Enlightenment, is an attempt to constrain a dynamic corner of the universein this case, the solar systemin an orderly model.Orreries represent the sun and planets with globes and clockwork mechanisms; the first modern one was built for Charles Boyle, the Fourth Earl of Orrery, in 1704.Olsens Geological Orrery eschews clockwork.Instead, it relies on the rate at which sediment accumulated in ancient lakes and rivers.Locked into the rock record, these layers of sediment provide clues about the Earths climate history, which in turn evidence the planets orbital variations over millions of years.The question of where the planets were hundreds of millions of years ago is couched in another: are the orbits of the planets stable?Eighteenth-century orreries presumed they were, even as Isaac Newton realized that in a system of more than two orbiting bodies, the gravitational interactions between them would send them careening apart or tumbling into one another.For his part, Newton declared the solar systems apparent invariability was evidence that a divine creator was tweaking the planetary motions, as if winding a watch.Preferring to live on a planet that would placidly orbit the sun forevermore, astronomers spent the next two centuries attempting to find an analytical proof that could demonstrate the solar system was stable.But the proof was unattainable: the solar system is chaotic.The chaos occurs over immense timescales and is caused by the accumulation of slight gravitational attractions between the planets.Jupiter tugs at Mercury; the moon is quietly divorcing the Earth.The planetary orbits wobble and wander, says PNAS study co-author Jessica Whiteside, a molecular paleontologist at the University of Southampton.As a result, astronomers can accurately estimate the relative positions of the planets only to about 60 million years agoanything beyond that and too much chaos builds up, obfuscating the deeper past.But hidden in that chaos is also a solution to finding out where the planets once were.The Earths orbit shifts between several statesmore circular or elliptical, with greater or lesser axial tilt and precessionacross millennia.The cycles between circular and elliptical orbits, called orbital eccentricity, change the Earths proximity to the sun over a period of about 400,000 years.This influences climate, a phenomenon known as Milankovitch cycles (after the astronomer who first proposed it).The climate fluctuations caused ice sheets to encroach or recede and lakes to fill or dry up.This fact is key to the Geological Orrery.Geologists Jim Hays, John Imbrie and Nicholas Shackleton confirmed Milankovitchs theory in 1976 in a seminal paper that proclaimed the cycles the pacemaker of Earths ice ages, and Olsen and other geologists set to work trying to better understand them.By the late eighties, it seemed like if you could get the whole record in [sediment] core it would be an opportunity to see what the pattern was really like at the largest scale, Olsen says.With Dennis Kent, a geologist at Lamont-Doherty and Rutgers, he began drilling sediment cores in the Newark Basin in northern New Jersey.The Basin was formed when the supercontinent Pangaea began to tear apart during the Late Triassic, about 220 million years ago.(Somewhat conveniently, the Lamont-Doherty Observatory is situated at the Basins northern end.)In 1996, Olsen and Kent showed Milankovitch cycles were affecting climate in Pangaeas tropics during the Late Triassic.They found evidence of several patterns: a 20,000-year precession cycle and 100,000-year, 400,000-year, and 2-million-year orbital eccentricity cycles.The seed of an idea was planted: What if they could use the same approach to reveal ancient planetary dynamics?Sediment cores drilled from the Newark and Hartford Rift Basins.Credit: Paul E. Olsen At Columbia for an astrobiology meeting, Olsen strides quickly along one hallway after another, searching for the stairway that will take him to the top floor.Hes running late.Another scientist calls out to him from his office, and they greet one another excitedly, the meeting temporarily forgotten.Do you know who this is?says Olsen.This is Jim Applegate, who designed the Digital Orrery!The pair fall into a conversation about the precession of the equinoxes: this, apparently, is how planetary scientists catch up.Applegate, an astrophysicist, was part of a team of scientists led by Gerald Jay Sussman that built a computer in the 1980s that could accurately predict planetary dynamics.Sussman is a Brooklyn-born polymath who has studied artificial intelligence at MIT for half a century.In 1983, he took a sabbatical and announced his intention to be an astronomer for a year, says Applegate, who was then a postdoc at Caltech.He wanted to build a special-purpose computer to integrate the solar system for a billion years.That computer became the Digital Orrery.It included a separate processor for the sun and each of the planetary bodies.In 1988, Sussman used it to reveal that Plutos orbit was irregular.The following year, French astronomer Jacques Laskar, the PNAS papers second author, numerically determined that the Earths orbit was chaotic, too.This has significant implications: say you measure the current position of the Earth in its journey around the sun, and youre off by just 15 metersor about 0.0000012 percent.Laskar showed that even an error as slight as this precludes the ability to predict where the Earth will be in 100 million years.We used the most precise model that we could make for planetary motion, taking into account all the planets, the minor planets, general relativity, everything, Laskar says.But even by doing that, we will never be able to compute a solution beyond 60 million years.There is no analytical solution to the solar system problem: you need empirical information.As he continued to analyze the sediment cores from the Newark Basin, it became very obvious that there was a 1.75-million-year cycle, Olsen says.This cycle was the result of the Earths slow gravitational waltz with Mars.Laskar had predicted it, but nobody had ever seen evidence of the cycle in the rock record before.By 1999, Olsen and Kent were able to show that the Earth-Mars cycle had shifted over time, and currently has a period of 2.4 million years.I got quite a bit of pushback on that, Olsen says.He is familiar with criticism.His ideas are ambitious, and geologists often disagree on the fidelity of the rock record, which is riddled with unconformities, he says.Possible unconformities include missing rock layers or changes in the rate at which sediment was deposited.Changes in the sedimentation rate will distort how time is represented in the record, says Frits Hilgen, a geoscientist at Utrecht University who was not involved in the Orrery study.This presents potential pitfalls for the Geological Orrery.It relies on a complete sedimentary record: if there are invisible gaps in it, it will hopelessly throw off the timing, and the whole endeavor could collapse.Plus, theres no way to know for sure if such gaps exist simply by looking at the rock record in any one place.Olsen knew he had to come up with a way to corroborate the evidence in the Newark Basin for the orrery to have any chance at success.So, we decided on checking by another coring experiment, he says.That was the Colorado Plateau.A vast desert crisscrossed with canyons and dotted with mountain ranges thrust up as a continental plate crumpled 250 million years ago, the Colorado Plateau straddles the Four Corners region of the Southwest and includes countless geological wonders.The sediment cores Olsen and Kent extracted from it in 2013 were drilled in Arizona.Kent, who is an expert in paleomagnetismthe branch of geophysics that studies the Earths ancient magnetic fieldsays the sediment there had the potential to corroborate the Newark Basin rock record.Massive volcanoes pummeled the surrounding terrain millions of years ago.Among this landscape were trace amounts of magnetic hematite particles that provided Olsen and Kent with a crucial corroborative clue.The Earths magnetic field sporadically flips, Kent explains, and those reversals are recorded in the magnetic particles in the sediment.They become almost like a bar code, he says.The sequence is quite distinctive when we have a good time record.If geologists can match that pattern to sedimentary records in widely dispersed places, they can confirm the rocks are of the same ageand importantly, determine whether the record in one location (for example, back in Newark) has any gaps.When Olsen and Kent compared the Colorado Plateau cores to the Newark Basin cores, they matched.* While on sabbatical in 2018ostensibly taken to write a book about dinosaur footprintsOlsen says he became interested in refining the core data, and he realized he could check the 100,000-year cycles against much longer ones.It gets very granular, he says, but explains it anyway: every planet wobbles on its axis like a spinning top, a phenomenon called the precession of perihelion.Each planets precession is slightly different20,000 years here, 25,700 years therebut together, the cycles could be used to check against the ones Olsen had found in the sediment cores.When he compared the celestial wobble cycles and geological cycles, they were a near-perfect match.Olsen pauses, savoring the punchline hes about to deliver.Normally what I would have done in the past, is I would have declared victory!he says.But Olsen realized that he could go a step further and check the 100,000-year Milankovitch cycles against longer ones, like the Earth-Mars cycle.He did so, and they matched.That is basically impossible, unless the data are an accurate representation of the cycles, Olsen says.Olsen sent the results to Laskar.That was terrifying, he says.After Laskar read it, they spoke.Laskar thought the data was too good, says Olsen.He suspected Olsen may have tuned his data using Laskars celestial predictions, but after Laskar checked the data himself, he got the same results.The 20,000-year celestial cycles were effectively embedded in the 100,000-year Milankovitch cycles, which were themselves embedded in the Earth-Mars cycle.The orrery worked.Paul Olsen stands near a core drilling site in Arizonas Petrified Forest National Park.Credit: Kevin Krajick Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory The Geological Orrery is currently a proof of concept: it reveals Earths climate history from 199 million to 223 million years ago, Olsen says, and derives planetary dynamics from that data.This is the first time that there is a solid landmark in Earth history when what would otherwise be indeterminable astronomical parameters are known, says Whiteside.In addition to planetary dynamics, the orrery could help reveal the timing of events such as mass extinctions or track changes in carbon dioxide concentrations over time and show how they interacted with Milankovitch cycles to affect climate.And the orrery has just barely begun to plumb the available sediment records.Amazingly, geology has provided us with three billion years worth of paleoclimate change records in the sediment record, says Linda Hinnov, a paleoclimatologist at George Mason University who was not involved in the study.That data could provide the astronomical parameters to better predict where the climate is currently headed, she says.Olsen says he does not consider the orrery to be a culmination of decades of work so much as the beginning of a new chapter in geophysical sciences.I see it more or less as a continuation of a process, he says.And I think that one can and should always project forward.He emphasizes the last few words, his voice rising to

The Robots Want to Steal (the Boring Parts of) Your Job:::::By now youre probably aware that a robot is standing right behind you, ready to take your job.Go ahead and look, just dont make eye contact, because robots, like baboons, dont appreciate that one bit.Thatll just make them want your job all the more.In reality, reports of the death of the job are greatly exaggerated.There are just too few things that robots and artificial intelligences can do better than humans at this point.We fleshy beings remain more creative, more dexterous, and more empathetica particularly important skill in health care and law enforcement.What is happening is that the machines are taking parts of jobs, which isnt anything new in the history of human labor: Humans no longer harvest wheat by hand, but with combines; we no longer write everything by hand, but with highly efficient word processors.Courtesy Erik Brynjolfsson Still, this new wave of automation could hurt real bad if were not careful.Which is where people like Erik Brynjolfsson, director of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, come in: Hes thinking hard about the past, present, and future of work, so you dont soon have a robot in your cubicle breathing down your neck.WIRED sat down with Brynjolfsson to talk about why the Westworld dystopia is (hopefully) far off, why our human creativity and empathy are so important, and why you should never use a telepresence robot to tell someone theyre dying.(This conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.)Matt Simon: So, be honest.How worried should I be about an AI stealing my job?Erik Brynjolfsson: I subscribe to the narrative that mass job replacement isn't here.What is imminent is the replacement of parts of jobs through AI but also through robotics.I think discussion in the press tends to fall into two overly simplistic camps.One is, "Oh, all the jobs are going to be automated away," which is very incorrect.Or it's, "Oh, there's nothing happening, its all hype."Those are both incorrect.The right understanding based on our research and many others is that certain tasks are being automated.Let's take one example.There are 27 distinct tasks that a radiologist does.One of them is reading medical images.A machine-learning algorithm might be 97 percent accurate, and a human might be 95 percent accurate, and you might think, OK, have the machine do it.Actually, that would be wrong.You're better off having the machine do it and then have a human check it afterward.Then you go from 97 percent to 99 percent accuracy, because humans and machines make different kinds of mistakes.But radiologists also consult with patients, coordinate care with other doctors, do all sorts of other things.Machine learning is pretty good at some of those tasks, like reading medical images; it's not much help at all in comforting a patient or explaining the diagnosis to them.MS: Which reminds me of the fiasco a while back where a hospital used a teleoperated robot to tell someone they were going to die.The family was upset.Well, duh.I don't know why more roboticists aren't warning about this.There's certain jobs that humans will probably always do, which are those that require the empathy that machines dont have.EB: Our brains are wired to react emotionally to other humans.Humans just have a comparative advantage at connecting with each other.We're very far from Westworld, and even there the robots weren't always that convincing.That's not where we are or will be anytime soon.I think this is great news, because for most of us, the parts of our job that involve creativity and connecting with others are the parts we like best.The part we don't like is repetitively lifting heavy boxes, and that's exactly what machines are really good at.It's a pretty good division of labor.MS: Which is a fascinating field in robotics right now, getting humans to actually work alongside machines without the machines killing them.The challenge is, adapting people to that.EB: In a robotics case you'd have a robot maybe doing heavy lifting, and then it lifts a part over to a human, and the human does the fine manipulation.But that requires a restructuring of that job.I think it's a little bit of a lazy mindset to look at a business process or a job and just sort of say, OK, how can a machine do that whole thing?That's rarely the right answer.Usually the right answer requires a little more creativity, which is, how can we redesign the process so parts of it can be done by a machine really effectively and other parts are done by a human really effectively, and they fit together in a new way.MS: The challenge is as much about adapting the machines to work with humans as it is adapting humans to work with machines.But say this technological revolution ends up automating whole jobs and we're seeing displacement.What is the strategy there?Is it a matter of something like UBI?We're not great at retraining here in the United States.EB: I really don't want to give short shrift to retraining and education that keep people engaged in the workforce and redeploy them into other tasks.But set the dial far enough in the future and I can imagine a world where, yes, machines can do most tasks.Shame on us if we screw that up, because that should be one of the best things ever.We should have vastly more wealth, like orders of magnitude more wealth, less need for work, much better health.And yes something like a UBI will come in gradually.Decent health care is free, education is free, maybe some basic level of food, clothing, shelter.Then that floor can gradually rise over time as society gets richer.Years from now people will look back and say, "Are you kidding me?You'd make somebody die of starvation if they didn't work hard enough?"That would just seem incredibly cruel.MS: The elephant in the room here, which might seem unrelated, is climate change.But what does a future look like where we are eliminating more and more human labor, we have a UBI in place, but we are consuming more because we have more wealth.What does that mean for a planet that is already at its tipping point?EB: I'm going to run against the sort of implicit part of your question.I think it's going to have us live lighter on the planet.We're already using less coal, oil, and lots of other resources in the United States than we did a decade ago.A digital world is one that is much lighter on the planet and has less impact, whether it's a digital book compared to a paper book, or videoconferencing compared to jet travel.Maybe soon we'll have artificial meat.If we do it right, which I think we are and we will, we'll have a lighter impact on the planet.MS: Sure, technology can get us out of certain messes.But its not a miracle curewe humans have to change too.EB: Technology is not destiny.We shape our destiny.And I don't want people to get pessimistic and say it's hopeless, it's all getting worse.I also don't want people to be optimistic and say, hey, technology is going to come to the rescue and save us.The right answer is that technology is an incredibly powerful tool, and if we make the effort, we can use this tool to live lighter on the planet.If we put the incentives in place and have a conscious approach to it, we can and will live lighter, but it won't happen automatically.It will only happen if we aggressively work on it.MS: Well that's reassuring to hear, because I'm sick of being negative all the time.EB: Well, keep that negativity sort of in your back pocket as a little bit of a club to say, look, don't get complacent.You've got to remind people that they have to make an effort.You can't just sit back and wait for AI to come to the rescue.That's not how it works.More Great WIRED Stories
A Blazing Hot Coal Seam Shows How Microbes Can Spring to Life:::::Just past the intersection of Centre and Locust in Centralia, Pennsylvania, the microbiologist Tammy Tobin turned the wheel of her aging Prius sharply to the right.As the windshield wipers whipped furiously back and forth to fend off the driving sleeta reminder that winter had yet to bid farewellTobin announced, Were here.We were at the base of a grassy slope nestled behind the SS.Peter and Paul Cemetery.It looked like any of the other countless knolls tucked in the anthracite hills of eastern Pennsylvania.But almost 50 meters beneath our feet lurked a hidden menace.Centralia was burning.Quanta Magazine About Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.Or rather, the coal seam under what used to be the town of Centralia was burning.The coal has burned for more than 50 years and will likely burn for centuries to come.As we climbed a low rise that hugged the back of the Catholic cemetery, no flames were visible, only puffs of steam where the dirt exhaled excess heat and the grass stubbornly refused to don its icy cap.All but a handful of the town folk had fled when the government revoked Centralias postal code in 2002.But Tobin, from Susquehanna University 30 miles west of Centralia, wasnt here to comb through the wreckage of a once-thriving town.Instead, she and a group of collaborators had set their sights on something much smaller.The heat and pollution from the underground fire wasnt just stressful for Centralias flora and fauna; it also created a crisis for the areas microbes.The trillions upon trillions of microscopic single-celled organisms at home in Centralias soil suddenly found themselves living in a veritable sauna.It was adaptor die.Or so scientists thought.Tammy Tobin, a microbiologist at Susquehanna University, was shocked to find that the blistering, toxic conditions around Centralia did not deplete the areas microbial biodiversity.New species that had been dormant in the soil as part of a microbial seed bank sprang to life under the forbidding conditions.Amanda ORourke Centralia is a beautiful sandbox for asking about what happens during an environmental disturbance, said Ashley Shade, Tobins former student, now a microbiologist at Michigan State University and a collaborator on the project.Even when that disturbance is like a sledgehammer.The coal-seam fire at Centralia provides researchers with the perfect opportunity to test a new idea known as a microbial seed bank: that commonly overlooked dormant individuals make up a vast reservoir of biodiversity, ready to spring to life when environmental conditions change.Although scientists had found hints from laboratory and environmental experiments that such a seed bank exists, Centralia represents a rare opportunity to see whether and how a microbial seed bank functions in the real world.900 Degrees Fahrenheit on the Ground No one knows exactly how the fire under Centralia started; local legend holds that somebody accidentally ignited the seam while burning trash just outside one of the mine shafts.What is known for certain is that, shortly before Memorial Day in 1962, residents of Centralia reported that a fire had started in the towns coal mine just east of the Odd Fellows Cemetery.It soon became obvious that even the most aggressive methods wouldnt stop the spread of the flames.Residents would simply have to wait for the fire to burn itself out.But in an area that dubbed itself coal country, there was no lack of underground material to burn through, so the fire outlasted the people.Although residents initially hoped that, because the fire was entirely below ground, they would be able to continue living in Centralia, the release of toxic gases and the opening of sinkholes made it too dangerous.Ashley Shade, a microbiologist at Michigan State University, collaborates with Tobin on studies of what lives in Centralias soil.Centralia is a beautiful sandbox for asking about what happens during an environmental disturbance, she said.Even when that disturbance is like a sledgehammer.Adele Han Most families left by choice or were bought out by the government.A few families, brave or foolhardy (take your pick), continue to live in Centralia, fire be damned.Although Centralia may have had the sharpest reversal of fortune, the economy of the entire region has gone from bad to worse over the past several decades.Ashley Shade is all too familiar with the travails of central Pennsylvania.She grew up a stones throw from Centralia, and although she knew about the fireyou couldnt really live near Centralia and not know about it, she saysshe never really gave it much thought.It wasnt until her first genetics class as an undergraduate at Susquehanna University in 2002 that she began to think of Centralia as something more than a nearby oddity.The year before, a team of geologists and soil scientists at Susquehanna had approached Tobin, who was Shades professor at the time, about setting up a formal study of how the fire was changing Centralia.They asked Tobin if she would help study the soil microbes in Centralia.Although she knew nothing about microbiology, she found the topic quirky and interesting, and so she agreed.She asked her students in 2002 whether any wanted to join her new project in Centralia or an existing study on bovine genetics.Both Shade and Tobin immediately fell in love with Centralia.The team staked out a range of sites spanning three contrasting areas: one above a spot where the fire had never been, one above where the fire was currently burning, and one where the subsurface flames had already come and gone.This would give the researchers an idea of how the soil microbes changed over time.Some never-burned sites were especially important because the fire was moving in that direction.Tobin and her fellow scientists could track what happened to the soil in real time.Seventeen years ago, when sequencing the genomes of large numbers of environmental microbes was prohibitively expensive, studying the genetics of soil microbes meant scientists would chop the DNA into small pieces.Each different species of microbe yielded a collection of genetic fragments that could be sorted by size.Using a probe to highlight ribosomal DNA sequences unique to each species, scientists could derive a genetic fingerprint for a microbe and identify its species by comparing their results to a large database of known prokaryotes.Although this ribotyping was more time-consuming and less precise than current molecular methods, it nonetheless provided Tobin and Shade with the first clues about what, if anything, may have survived Centralias below-ground inferno.A place could go from being cool to being very hot pretty quickly, and it fluctuates with all kinds of climatic and geological factors, Tobin said.Could things adapt quickly enough?Depending on how much oxygen could reach the fire, the flames under Centralia could burn as hot as 1,350 degrees Fahrenheit, and ground temperatures sometimes exceeded 900 F. In 2007, a German documentary film crew bought a single egg from a local cafeteria so they could fry it by a steam vent and eat it for breakfast as an on-camera gimmick.However, the egg didnt fry.Instead, the soil was so hot that, with a quick sizzle and hiss, the egg charred beyond recognition before the crew could frame their shot, leaving nothing for their toast or their viewers.Under such extreme conditions, Tobin told me as we wound our way along the Pennsylvania byways from her lab at Susquehanna to Centralia, it was entirely possible that nothing had survived.To her delight, she was wrong.Members of Shades laboratory collect soil samples, measurements of the air and soil temperature, carbon dioxide readings and other environmental data at a hot site in Centralia.Ashley Shade In a 2005 study in Soil Science, Tobin and colleagues showed not only that microbes survive in the soil above actively burning areas, but that some species thrive there.The overall level of diversity was the same in hot areas (with temperatures ranging between roughly 90 F and 170 F) as in areas that the fire had yet to reach.When the researchers looked more closely, they found that although the overall bacterial diversity decreased with higher temperatures, even the hottest samples apparently still held thriving microbial communities.Shade and Tobin also identified heat-loving bacteria (thermophiles) that resembled microbes living near geothermal hot springs in Iceland, though their data wasnt detailed enough to say just how closely the organisms were related.What their data couldnt tell them, however, was whether the microbes living over the fire had lurked there all along in very low numbers or whether they had been blown in or had otherwise arrived from afar, perhaps from other geothermal areas around the globe.It was anyones guess as to which might be right.Not Dead but Dormant As Tobin and Shade continued chipping away at the microbial mystery in Centralia, the Indiana University biologist Jay Lennon had a mystery of his own.As the cost of genetic sequencing plummeted and computer programs grew more sophisticated, it became possible for researchers to sequence DNA directly from environmental samples, for studies known as metagenomics.For the first time, scientists didnt need to culture organisms to study them in the lab.Just by sequencing the DNA of microbes in an environment, they could find out what lived there and in what quantity.But the abundance of an organism doesnt tell us whether it is active, said Alexander Loy, a microbiologist at the University of Vienna.To assay metabolic activity, biologists use strategies such as measuring how much RNA an organism is making; because RNA is a much shorter-lived molecule than relatively durable DNA, its a truer indicator of current metabolism and not just the cells existence.By analogy, a census taker can count all the buildings on a city block, but that alone wont say whether they are homes or businesses, or if theyre currently occupied.For those answers, the census worker might need to conduct interviews door to door, or measure water and electricity usage.When Lennon began looking at biological samples from lake water, soil and even feces in 2010, over and over again he found the microbial equivalent of abandoned buildings.Lots of species were there, but a large proportion of the microbes in seemingly every environment didnt appear to be doing anything.Jay Lennon, who studies microbial biodiversity at Indiana University, noticed that a huge share of the biomass in most environments is tied up in dormant cells a microbial seed bank that may be waiting for the right conditions before they reanimate.Jean Lennon These dormant microbes with very reduced metabolic activity exist in a liminal space between life and death.They might not be doing many of the activities typically associated with life, such as growing, eating or replicating their genes, but they are also very clearly not deadbecause sometimes they will become animated again.Go to sleep, if you will, and you have the ability to wake back up, Lennon said.The concept of dormant microbes was at least a century old, but biologists thought they were rare.Most of what was known about dormancy came from bacteria that formed hardy spores, including Bacillus anthracis, the soil microbe famous for causing anthrax.The ability to form spores can protect a bacterium from everything: high doses of ultraviolet and gamma radiation, prolonged drought, the vacuum of space.People have resurrected bacteria from amber, he said.The downside of relying on spores as a survival strategy is that it is extremely demanding.Ten percent of the B. anthracis genome is devoted to forming spores, and the process can take more than five hours, start to finish.With such high biological startup costs, this ability only evolved once in a single group of bacteria, as far as researchers know.This suggested that such Lazarus microbes are tiny oddities.Data from Lennon and other microbiologists, however, indicated that dormancy might be the rule, not the exception.More than 90 percent of the microbial biomass [in soil] is inactive, he said.Dormancy explained how so many microbesup to 1010 cells per gram of soilcould coexist.In some sense, they didnt, at least not all at the same time.Rather than using up valuable resources by fighting each other for food and space, microbes could instead enter a dormant phase to wait for better environmental conditions.Dormancy also gave microbes a way to survive the feast-or-famine waves of food and other essentials, as well as the limitations of extreme environments.Dormant organisms arent as hardy as spores, but their quiescent state means they dont have to waste valuable resources coping with stressors.Temperatures that might kill a rapidly dividing organism can become bearable if the microbe doesnt have to find food, make proteins and attend to other housekeeping tasks.As a result, the quiescent organisms can tolerate a wider range of temperatures and other environmental conditions than if they were growing as usual.Borrowing a phrase from botany, Lennon called this vast reserve of dormant organisms the microbial seed bank, which was just waiting around for the right environmental conditions to grow and thrive.Lucy Reading-Ikkanda/Quanta Magazine Scientists used to believe that the soil microbes found in the deserts of Antarctica were the same as those found in the Amazon rainforest, but studies showed that, like all organisms, soil microbes are highly adapted to local conditions.For this reason, Lennon doesnt think the Earth has a global microbial seed bank.Instead, each soil community, such as the dirt in Centralia, has its own local seed bank.Local microbes deposit themselves into the seed bank when conditions are less than ideal.Microbes from elsewhere can also hitchhike into the area, arriving on the feet and feathers of birds or blowing in on the wind.Some of them may try to make a go of it and either thrive or die out, but others will hunker down and wait.The microbial ecologist Genoveva Esteban of Bournemouth University in the U.K. saw the microbial seed bank at work in Priest Pot, a 10,000-year-old pond in northern Englands Lake District.Esteban brought samples of microbial eukaryotes (small, single-celled organisms with a nucleus) from Priest Pot back to the lab to grow.Like their nucleus-deficient prokaryotic brethren, eukaryotes are challenging to grow in culture.Most just dont want to grow in the lab.When Esteban peeked at drops of lake water under the microscope, she saw hundreds of types of swirling and swimming creatures.In the lab, she could identify only 20 species growing in the culture bottle.Then she divided the culture and grew it in a range of environments.(We really squeezed our imaginations to come up with every possible combination of conditions, Esteban said.)Three months later, she had 135 species.There were all these hidden organisms, just waiting for the right conditions to appear, she said.The same thing happened when Esteban took samples from Andalusias salt pans, those hypersaline remnants of ancient seas in what is now southern Spain.Initially, she could detect only seven microbial species in samples from six different salt flats.She gradually diluted those samples and let them grow for five weeks or more, and the number of species shot up to 95.In a sense, Estebans deliberate environmental manipulations mimicked what happens when conditions shift in the natural world including what happens as the climate continues to warm.High in the Alaskan Arctic, Janet Jansson, a microbiologist at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory outside of Richland, Washington, was tracking how global warming was affecting microbes in Hess Creek.For thousands of years, the subsurface soil in the area had been permanently frozen, but global warming is changing that, causing the underground soil layers to begin to thaw.In this colored scanning electron micrograph of the bacterium Viridibacillus arvi, the yellow, more bulbous cells are dormant spores.The green, more rod-shaped cells are beginning to germinate and return to more active life.Dennis Kunkel Microscopy/Science Photo Library In results published in Nature in 2011, Jansson found that after thawing a sample for just 48 hours, she could begin to see a shift in the communitys DNA.This hinted at a rise in the abundance of carbon-eating bacteria, as opposed to the type of microbe thats usually found in the permafrost, eking out a living by using iron as an energy source.Later sampling of both thawed and frozen sites, backed up by RNA analysis, confirmed that the DNA wasnt lying.In the thawed soil, the iron-reducing microbes had been largely replaced by others using organic carbon for food.These differences, Jansson found, were inherent in the system.Its a very extreme difference in function, she said.These organisms are already there, just in low numbers.The environment selects for whats able to thrive.From an ecological perspective, Loy says, seed banks provide the system with a kind of insurance policy.If you take antibiotics, those with resistance genes can grow and take over those empty niches, Loy said.Seed banks function the same way, with dormant organisms becoming dominant when environmental conditions change.Tobin and Shade hypothesized that a microbial seed bank could explain some of what they were seeing in Centralia.Their long-term experiments were cranking along, giving them the perfect opportunity to test this idea, when suddenly, disaster struck.A Backup Plan for Ecosystems Just as Centralia has attracted plenty of oddball microbes, it has also attracted weirdos of the more bipedal variety.During the freezing afternoon Tobin and I spent traipsing around Centralia, several cars pulled off Locust Avenue to ask us for directions to the fire.This always happens, she told me as the cars drove off, disappointed to learn that they wouldnt be able to see any flames.The old Route 61, which partially collapsed for the final time in 1993 and forced the state to build a bypass, still exists as an asphalt canvas for graffiti artists.Their work ranges from the prosaic L+L 4EVER to pieces of a more scatological and sexual nature.Tobin shrugged off much of this vandalism.But in 2006, a group of treasure hunters tore through much of the land in and around Centralia, digging up soil on their hunt for antique glass.One of the locations they destroyed was the long-term study site that she and Shade had developed.Overnight, half a decade of work was lost.It looked like it was a war zone, Tobin said.By the time Tobin got her research fully up and running again, Shade had completed her doctorate in microbiology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and found a faculty position at Michigan State University.She never forgot her time at Centralia, however, so in 2014 she called up her old professor and asked Tobin to collaborate.That October, Shade and her lab manager hopped on a plane and flew to Pennsylvania.Armed with trowels, quart-size canning jars, and ample bleach to sanitize their shovels and shoes, the squad descended onto what remained of the town and began taking soil samples.The team dug up soil from several locations once again: over an active fire, over regions that had burned and since cooled, and over parts of the mine that had never caught fire.After carefully packing the filled canning jars into a large cooler, Shade returned to East Lansing and began to study the dirt in her lab.She started by comparing the species living in each of the three groups.She initially believed that the microbes from the actively burning areas would have the least variation between sites: The challenges of growing in such extreme heat, she figured, would severely limit what kinds of organisms could grow.After the fire burned itself out and the ground cooled, Shade expected that the microbes would return to a more diverse state.In fact, she and Tobin found the exact opposite: Microbial populations in the hot areas diverged and then re-converged as the ground cooled over a period of 10-20 years.Microbial communities have an immense capacity to respond and recover, Shade said.There seems to be this inherent capacity in the system thats just sleeping.Regardless of how the microbial populations changed, Shade and Tobin hypothesized that Centralias microbial seed bank was what allowed the system to respond to the temperature surge from the fire and return to its initial state.A further study in PLOS ONE showed that the seed bank may also have allowed the soil to respond to increased levels of arsenic and other heavy metals that the fire released.To Esteban, thats the entire point of the seed bank.A seed bank means that ecosystem function will never stop.Even if conditions change, the ecosystem can keep going, she said.The process also benefits individual species.Most microbes live on a razors edge between life and death, Lennon says.And going dormant is better than dying.Exactly what triggers this dormancy, however, remains unclear.Nor do scientists know whether the entire population of a microbe will opt for dormancy or if some might become dormant as a hedge fund for their brethren that try to make a go of it, even in adverse circumstances.For now, however, the role of the microbial seed bank and even its very presence remain conjectural.Shade and her grad students drive back to the abandoned town every fall to gather more samples.On her most recent trip, she took soil samples from never-burned sites, brought them back to the lab, and began heating them up under controlled conditions to see how they responded.This set of experiments is still ongoing, but Shade hopes that it can begin to answer some fundamental questions about the role of seed banks.Those answers wont just provide insight into whats happening at Centralia or at thousands of other coal-mine fires throughout the world.They could also yield valuable clues as to how the worlds microbes will respond to a warming climate.Centralias position at the fulcrum of climate issues is based on more than just its microbes.Even as the towns coal continues to burn below ground, several wind turbines have been erected at the top of a nearby ridge.Whether the town will be able to demonstrate the kind of resilience shown by its local microbes remains to be seen.In the meantime, the turbines continue to turn slowly in the breeze.Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of

AI Could Predict Death. But What If the Algorithm Is Biased?:::::Earlier this month the University of Nottingham published a study in PloSOne about a new artificial intelligence model that uses machine learning to predict the risk of premature death, using banked health data (on age and lifestyle factors) from Brits aged 40 to 69.This study comes months after a joint study between UC San Francisco, Stanford, and Google, which reported results of machine-learning-based data mining of electronic health records to assess the likelihood that a patient would die in hospital.One goal of both studies was to assess how this information might help clinicians decide which patients might most benefit from intervention.WIRED OPINION ABOUT Amitha Kalaichandran, M.H.S., M.D., is a resident physician based in Ottawa, Canada.Follow her on Twitter at @DrAmithaMD.The FDA is also looking at how AI will be used in health care and posted a call earlier this month for a regulatory framework for AI in medical care.As the conversation around artificial intelligence and medicine progresses, it is clear we must have specific oversight around the role of AI in determining and predicting death.There are a few reasons for this.To start, researchers and scientists have flagged concerns about bias creeping into AI.As Eric Topol, physician and author of the book Deep Medicine: Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare, puts it, the challenge of biases in machine learning originate from the "neural inputs" embedded within the algorithm, which may include human biases.And even though researchers are talking about the problem, issues remain.Case in point: The launch of a new Stanford institute for AI a few weeks ago came under scrutiny for its lack of ethnic diversity.Then there is the issue of unconscious, or implicit, bias in health care, which has been studied extensively, both as it relates to physicians in academic medicine and toward patients.There are differences, for instance, in how patients of different ethnic groups are treated for pain, though the effect can vary based on the doctor's gender and cognitive load.One study found these biases may be less likely in black or female physicians.(Its also been found that health apps in smartphones and wearables are subject to biases.)In 2017 a study challenged the impact of these biases, finding that while physicians may implicitly prefer white patients, it may not affect their clinical decision-making.However it was an outlier in a sea of other studies finding the opposite.Even at the neighborhood level, which the Nottingham study looked at, there are biasesfor instance black people may have worse outcomes of some diseases if they live in communities that have more racial bias toward them.And biases based on gender cannot be ignored: Women may be treated less aggressively post-heart attack (acute coronary syndrome), for instance.When it comes to death and end-of-life care, these biases may be particularly concerning, as they could perpetuate existing differences.A 2014 study found that surrogate decisionmakers of nonwhite patients are more likely to withdraw ventilation compared to white patients.The SUPPORT (Study To Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments) study examined data from more than 9,000 patients at five hospitals and found that black patients received less intervention toward end of life, and that while black patients expressed a desire to discuss cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with their doctors, they were statistically significantly less likely to have these conversations.Other studies have found similar conclusions regarding black patients reporting being less informed about end-of-life care.Yet these trends are not consistent.One study from 2017, which analyzed survey data, found no significant difference in end-of-life care that could be related to race.And as one palliative care doctor indicated, many other studies have found that some ethnic groups prefer more aggressive care toward end of lifeand that this may be related to a response to fighting against a systematically biased health care system.Even though preferences may differ between ethnic groups, bias can still result when a physician may unconsciously not provide all options or make assumptions about what options a given patient may prefer based on their ethnicity.However, in some cases, cautious use of AI may be helpful as one component of an assessment at end of life, possibly to reduce the effect of bias.Last year, Chinese researchers used AI to assess brain death.Remarkably, using an algorithm, the machine was better able to pick up on brain activity that had been missed by doctors using standard techniques.These findings bring to mind the case of Jahi McMath, the young girl who fell into a vegetative state after a complication during surgical removal of her tonsils.Implicit bias may have played a role not just in how she and her family were treated, but arguably in the conversations around whether she were alive or dead.But Topol cautions that using AI for the purposes of assessing brain activity should be validated before they are used outside of a research setting.We know that health providers can try to train themselves out of their implicit biases.The unconscious bias training that Stanford offers is one option, and something Ive completed myself.Other institutions have included training that focuses on introspection or mindfulness.But it's an entirely different challenge to imagine scrubbing biases from algorithms and the datasets they're trained on.LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Artificial Intelligence Given that the broader advisory council that Google just launched to oversee the ethics behind AI is now canceled, a better option would be allowing a more centralized regulatory bodysuch as building upon the proposal put forth by the FDAthat could serve universities, the tech industry, and hospitals.Artificial intelligence is a promising tool that has shown its utility for diagnostic purposes, but predicting death, and possibly even determining death, is a unique and challenging area that could be fraught with the same biases that affect analog physician-patient interactions.And one day, whether we are prepared or not, we will be faced by the practical and philosophical conundrum

Ancestry.com’s Racist Ad Tumbles Into a Cultural Minefield:::::On Thursday, the worlds largest DNA testing company, Ancestry.com, pulled a video advertisement amid a cascade of criticism on social media.The ad, titled Inseparable and cinematically shot to portray a gauzy, gothic moment on the streets of the antebellum South, depicted a white man offering a black woman a ring and imploring her to escape to the North with him.In the captions, they are referred to as lovers.As the video ends, a stylized Canadian marriage certificate for the two characters dated 1857 appears and the voiceover urges the viewer to uncover the lost chapters of your family history with Ancestry.The ad appeared online earlier this month, but as BuzzFeed first reported, it didnt draw much attention until critics on social media began sharing it in outrage this week.They decried it as a whitewashed, revisionist account of the traumas that stamped interracial sexual relations during Americas centuries of violent chattel slavery.In a statement to WIRED, Ancestry said it had removed the video from YouTube and was in the process of pulling it from television.Ancestry is committed to telling important stories from history, the company said.This ad was intended to represent one of those stories.We very much appreciate the feedback we have received and apologize for any offense that the ad may have caused.Ancestry did not answer WIREDs questions about the ad or about the demographic makeup of its 14 million-strong DNA database.Among the offenses catalogued by Twitter users were the myriad historical fallacies Ancestry crammed into the 30-second clipthe idea that black women could only be rescued from slavery by a white male savior; that most mixed-race people in America today descend from loving, consenting relationships when the biggest historical reason is rape; that interracial romance was even possible in slave-holding states given the extreme power asymmetries of the institution; that the North was some promised land of equal opportunity (spoiler alert, it wasnt).But there was another fairy tale that Ancestry was selling toothat in exchange for a few tablespoons of spit, the company could magically fill in the branches of family trees severed by the transatlantic slave trade.Founded by a pair of Brigham Young University graduates in the mid-90s, Ancestry has long been amassing troves of genealogical informationfrom birth, death, and wedding certificates to census data and family photographs.The Lehi, Utah, based company claims to upload an average of 2 million searchable records to its website each day.When Ancestry added DNA testing services in 2012, five years after the launch of its chief competitor, 23andMe, it was able to catapult ahead by leveraging its built-in community of genealogy enthusiasts, which draws largely from the Mormon church.And Mormons keep great records.But for people descended from American slaves, tracing family ties isnt so straightforward.Slaves names were often changed when they were sold to new owners or escaped.Very few of the millions of rapes that resulted in pregnancies were ever reported.(In fact, Southern states made it legally impossible for slave women to file rape charges against a white man prior to 1861.)The historical excavation process digs up painful truths as often as it does dead ends.DNA can help connect the dots, but the ethnicity estimates companies can wring from a tube of saliva are only as accurate as the data they have.And because DNA databases like Ancestrys are so overwhelmingly white, they tell a much vaguer origin story for African Americans than for European immigrants who settled in the US.If youre mostly of Irish descent, for example, Ancestry can tell you which side of the Dingle Peninsula your distant relatives lived in, or which one of 10 corners of the southern county of Cork they called home.Ancestry can divide the 32,000-square-mile island of Ireland into 85 distinct genetic populations.For the entire African continent, the company can only carve out nine.With that level of resolution, inferring the exact sources of ancestry for African Americans just isnt possible at the present moment (though a January update does provide a more detailed look at how African American communities moved around the US following the Civil War).Recruiting a more diverse customer base would certainly help lift some of those limitations, something the now-removed video seems clearly intended to do.Its part of a larger effort the company has undertaken recently to target African Americans.Earlier this year it began running ads during the History Channels $50 million dollar reboot of the iconic 1977 Roots miniseries.And at the Sundance Festival in February, Ancestry released a short documentary film about an enslaved woman named Mary Weems who escaped to Canada, called Railroad Ties, which aired multiple times on AMC throughout Black History Month.But some critics say that marketing money would be better spent educating people, especially people of color, about the true promise and pitfalls of DNA testing.Theres a huge information gap, says Janina M. Jeff, a population geneticist and host of the In Those Genes podcast, who was among the people who took to Twitter this week to point out the problems with Ancestrys ad.She found its insensitivity to the ways DNA tests can retraumatize communities of color particularly egregious, but she says that Ancestry isnt alone in selling an incomplete picture of whats possible with DNA testing.Companies that offer genetic health scores to estimate your odds of getting certain diseases, like 23andMes new Type 2 Diabetes report, dont often advertise that those calculations are less accurate for African Americans because theyre underrepresented in the database.And many testing firms gloss over the privacy issues that come with having your genetic code permanently on file.Instead of addressing these hard questions these companies are pushing their products in a way that encourages people to naively give their DNA away without fully understanding the consequences, says Jeff.She worries that these types of blunders will erode trust in DNA technologies and undermine efforts to include communities of color in genetic studies, like the National Institutes of Healths All of Us project, that could help fuel much needed medical advances for minority populations long neglected by the research establishment.Genes are just starting to unlock the secrets of peoples histories along with clues to their futures, making DNA among the most sensitive data around.This latest episode shows that companies like Ancestry still need to prove they can be trusted with it.More Great WIRED Stories
How to Cook With Weed—and a Dash of Tasty, Tasty Science:::::Mac and cheese.Peanut butter and jelly.Asparagus and cannabis oil with a citrusy terpene profile?Welcome to food pairings in the heady era of cannabis legalization.A new breed of chef is thriving, experimenting with how to infuse dishes with weed, whose various strains might smell and taste of lemon or mushroom or grain.And, of course, they can complement that taste with the intoxicating experience of THC, like traditional chefs might pair foods with particular wines.Its all nerdy as hell, and it just so happens that one of the top cannabis chefs in America, Michael Magallanes, is also a chef in WIREDs San Francisco office.(To be clear, the food he cooks for us is great, but decidedly weed-free.)So on this 420, come with us on a science-packed journey into the frontier of cannabis cuisine.First, we need to talk about what cannabis does to the human body.When you inhale cannabis vapor from a distilled oil, or you smoke pure flower, THC travels along an unobstructed avenue from the lungs right into the bloodstream.From there, the THC molecules head into the brain and interact with the endocannabinoid system, fitting nicely into the CB1 receptor to produce psychoactive effects.THC eventually hits the liver after smoking, but not in nearly the same amounts as when you eat cannabis.With this avenue, THC makes a beeline from your stomach to your liver, where your body metabolizes it into something called 11-hydroxy-THC.The liver's main job is to make things water-soluble, so they can be excreted and exit the body, says Jeff Raber, CEO of the Werc Shop, a cannabis lab.If they stayed in our body and built up, wow, it would be bad.The tricky bit about the liver doing its metabolization thing with THC is that 11-hydroxy-THC is five times as potent as its precursor.Which is why edibles can hit you so damn hard, and why cannabis chefs are very methodical about their work.LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Cannabis You see, THC in the plant naturally comes in the form of tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, or THCA, which is non-psychoactive.Its only after you heat THCA, in a process called decarboxylation, that it transforms into THC, though tiny amounts will convert naturally over time at room temperature.So cannabis chef Michael Magallanes first step (again, outside the WIRED offices) was figuring out how long to heat his weed and at what temperature.It probably took a good month of doing different times and temperatures and sending those to a lab, he says.The lab in turn gave him THC readings.Now I have a really consistent way of doing it.Specifically, he puts the cannabis in a bag in boiling water at 100 degrees Celsius for between an hour and a half and two hours.From there, Magallanes infuses the cannabis into various kinds of cooking oils, such as coconut or olive.This he does at a lower temperature, to avoid converting even more THCA into THC (thus throwing off his careful calculations), for four to five hours.He can then add these oils to things like purees or other foods that dont involve high-heat cooking.Because he works with oilas opposed to infusing THC into a meals main ingredientMagallanes can be very precise with his doses and tailor them to match guests preferences.Novices tend to do best with between 3 and 5 milligrams of THC over the course of the meal, while experienced cannabis users (particularly medical users) will go up to 1,000 milligrams.Then it's just a matter of getting the right plate to the right person, says Magallanes.I haven't had any complications with that so far.The high is only part of the experience.Different cannabis varieties express different compositions of terpenes, the volatile compounds that make weed smell and taste like weed.That means one variety might taste like citrus, which Magallanes could add to asparagus with some lemon, complemented with the sourness of hawthorn berry.Another strain might come across as more grainy, and go well with chicken and mushrooms.Ask WIRED How much weed should you try if it's your first time?For me, it's about trying to push the boundaries in the culinary world, says Magallanes.I'm trying to source quality ingredients to put into my food the same way I would with any ingredient like asparagus.It's just really unexplored.But back to the high.Just like a tasting menu at a fine restaurant might come with wine pairings, heightening the experience both with additional flavors and drunkenness, so too might cannabis chefs use weed to augment a meal.It's a cerebral experience that actually enhances the flavor and smell and visual aspect of the food, says Magallanes.Problem, though: You may have noticed a conspicuous lack of cannabis restaurants popping up in states that have legalized recreational use.Part of the issue is permitting.Looking at it from the business owner's perspective, getting a retail cannabis license is way harder than getting a liquor license, says Morgan Fox, spokesperson for the National Cannabis Industry Association.Two, a cannabis restaurant wouldnt be able to let anyone under 21 in the door, which is great for patrons who hate children, but not great for an establishments bottom line.They also have to worry about legal dosing, because you can't sell any product in most of these states that has more than 10 milligrams of THC per unit, Fox adds.If you've got a bowl of chili, it's a lot more difficult to ensure for regulators that you're staying within those bounds.Still, Fox says, the demand for cannabis cuisine is extremely stronganecdotally at least.So for now, culinary cannabis will remain a privately catered affair, and most of our asparagus will remain relentlessly sober.More Great WIRED Stories
You’re Not Getting Enough Sleep—and It’s Killing You:::::The whole world is exhausted.And its killing us.But particularly me.As I write this, Im at TED 2019 in Vancouver, which is a weeklong marathon of talks and workshops and coffee meetings and experiences and demos and late-night trivia contests and networking, networking, networking.Meanwhile, Im sick as a dog with a virus I caught from my 3-year-old, Im on deadline for what feels like a bazillion stories, and Im pregnant, which means I need coffee but cant have too much, and need sleep but can only lay on my left side, and cant breathe without sitting propped up with a pillow anyway, since I cant safely take any cold medication.According to neuroscientist Matthew Walker, Im doing serious damage to my healthand lifeby not sleeping enough.The decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness, even the safety and education of our children.Its a silent sleep loss epidemic.Its fast becoming one of the greatest challenges we face in the 21st century, Walker, an expert in sleep at UC Berkeley and author of the best-selling book Why We Sleep, told a rapt TED audience on Thursday.After a morning of bleak talks on climate change and the harm of viral misinformation onlinepunctuated by frequent exclamations of Well, that was alarming by TED science curator David Biello, and stolen glances at Twitter for updates on the Mueller report and the happenings in the outside worldWalkers talk felt like a jolt of caffeine to a weary system.(A comparison Walker might hate.He warns, in the strongest possible terms, about the harms of that particular stimulant.)He ran down all the ways in which sleep deprivation hurts people: it makes you dumber, more forgetful, unable to learn new things, more vulnerable to dementia, more likely to die of a heart attack, less able to fend off sickness with a strong immune system, more likely to get cancer, and it makes your body literally hurt more.Lack of sleep distorts your genes, and increases your risk of death generally, he said.It disrupts the creation of sex hormones like estrogen and testosterone, and leads to premature aging.Apparently, men who only sleep five hours a night have markedly smaller testicles than men who sleep more than seven.Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny of your physiology, he said.Sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury.Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity.It is your life support system.Of all the TED Talks Ive heard this week, this one felt aimed right at me.At my heart.And my withered and overworked hippocampus, my brains information inbox, as Walker calls it.At my swollen, dark-ringed eyes.Yes, OK, maybe its because Im so tired, and was so primed to hear it.But I wasnt alone.Everyone is obsessed with sleep.And they know theyre not getting enoughhence the growing demand for sleeping pills, the emergence of sleep tracking devices (Walker wears an Oura Ring to track his), smart beds, Alexa integrations to put you to sleep, and mindfulness sleep apps.Arianna Huffington famously left journalism to found a company devoted to sleep and wellness.After Walkers talk, he was mobbed by acolytes in the conference center desperate to tell him how much his bookwhich covers the same topic as his TED talkchanged their lives, how theyd given up caffeine and alcohol and stopped feeling bad for leaving parties early to get sleep or refusing to look at work emails in bed.As the next session of TED talks was starting up, Walker kept trying to escape so he could watch, but people wouldn't let him pass.They wanted to know what to eat, when to sleep, how to dream.His answers?Dont drink caffeine or alcohol.Go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time every morning (even on the weekends).Sleep in a cool room.If you are lying awake in bed, listening to the litany of worries your brain is churning through, get up, go into a different room, and do an activity, then return to bed when youre ready.You wouldnt sit at the dinner table waiting to get hungry, so why lay in bed waiting to get tired, he told a TED attendee whod asked for advice.Meditate to calm your nervous system and your mind.Dont default to sleeping pills, which are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep, he said.Eventually, he said, he may be able to offer an affordable, portable brain-stimulating device that would use transcranial direct-current stimulation to help people have deeper sleep.(Walker has just started a company called Stim Science, with backing from Khosla Ventures, to make such a product, he told WIRED.)People listened hard.They took notes during his talk (which is uncommon at TED, to my surprise) and as he spoke to the crowd afterward.His message came across as a rebuke of the idea that sleep deprivation and success somehow go hand in hand.Tim Cook reportedly wakes up at 3:45 am to start work.Barack Obama said he only sleeps about 5 hours.Hes a night guy.Donald Trump and Elon Musk both have said they sleep only a few hours a night.But Musk has also admitted to The New York Times that his work schedule was taking a toll on his mental health and whole life.Walker argued that its time to stop thinking that needing sleep is a sign of weakness or laziness.In fact, its the opposite.Sleep makes us better at everything.The disruption of deep sleep is contributing to cognitive decline, Walker saysin aging patients at risk of or already experiencing dementia, and even in healthy people.You need sleep after learning, to essentially hit the save button on those new memories so you dont forget.But recently weve discovered that you also need sleep before learning.Almost like a dry sponge to suck up new information.Without sleep, the brain becomes essentially water logged.That sounds about right.Yesterday, I heard approximately 18 different TED Talks.But I had barely slept the night before, and I barely slept last night.When asked this morning which talk had been my favorite of the day before, it took me a full 30 seconds to remember a single one.Im determined to remember this one.In fact, I retreated to one of TEDs sleep rooms afterward and attempted a five-minute nap before writing this article in an effort to commit the talk to memory.I put on a sleep mask and let the white noise machine and a Pure essential oil diffuser lull me into a moment of calm.In the eerie quiet of this manufactured zen zone inside a behemoth conference center at the foothills of the North Shore Mountains, I almost forgot about the news cycle, about my head cold, about the Mueller report.But then I remembered my deadline, bolted upright, unplugged the diffuser, plugged in my computer, and typed these words.Heres hoping they help you, and me, get a little sleep tonight.More Great WIRED Stories
New York’s Aggressive Climate Law Takes Aim at Skyscrapers:::::On Thursday, the New York City Council voted into law a sweeping set of rules to fight climate change, a metropolis-scaled version of a Green New Deal.And if the lawmakers and policy wonks who built the bills have their way, theyll be a model for cities everywhere to cut carbon emissions and save the planet.The Climate Mobilization Act, an omnibus of a half-dozen bills, takes an aggressive posture to reducing carbon emissions from Americas most populous city.Those 8.6 million people emitted 4.5 million metric tonnes of carbon in 2016; in most of the world knocking that number down would probably mean cutting emissions from cars and trucks.And this Green New (York) Deal does include more work on converting the citys school bus fleet to electric, and on spinning up wind turbines and replacing the citys 21 gas-fired power plants.But New York, New York, is a wonderful town; the people ride in a hole in the ground.In other words, public transit use is widespread.Well, when its working.Point is, 70 percent of NYC emissions come from heating and cooling a million buildingsand a third of that carbon comes from just 50,000 buildings of 25,000 square feet or more.Blame the skyscrapers.Trump Tower is apparently a representative of the 2 percent of very, very bad emitters, for what its worth.So one of the new bills tells the owners of those big buildings they have to cut their emissions by 40 percent in 2030, and 80 percent by 2050.Thats a lot.We have to pay attention.The water is speaking to us.In the last century New York Harbor is up one foot, says John Mandyck, CEO of the Urban Green Council, which helped design the bill.Theres no question that this bill sets tough, tough carbon limits.Its not going to be easy.Thats a reflection of the fact that climate change is a tough issue.As to how those buildings get there, their owners have a few paths.They can buy green power, which is really more hopeful than realistic at this point; 70 percent of New York Citys power comes from carbon-emitting fossil fuels.But ideally this option will incentivize a market for wind turbines and hydro power, and in fact another bill in the omnibus aims to pave the way for green rooftops with solar panels.Also the building can work with the city to figure out what kinds of improvements would get emissions downnew boilers, better insulation, new windows, all kinds of new investments that would, not coincidentally, translate to thousands of construction and building-trade jobs in the city.Ey, these boilers aint gonna install themselves, knowwutImean?And in an approach out of Kim Stanley Robinsons post-climate-flood novel New York 2140 (or maybe the Crimson Permanent Assurance) individual buildings would be able to trade carbon credits.Thats a real breakthrough policy tool.Its never been done at this scale at a city level, Mandyck says.Its a flexible tool especially for building owners that own portfolios.So those folks could trade credits among their own buildings, or form alliances and breakaway archipelagos of skyscraping carbon trade routes.Passing a package like this takes years of coordination and negotiation; some of this policy work dates back to Michael Bloombergs mayoral administration.Costa Constantinides, a councilmember leading the legislation, has been working on the issue for a decade, and the first bill requiring similar upgrades got introduced in 2017.New Yorkers now realize the realities of climate change, which is why weve spent the last two years crafting sound legislation aimed at carbon, says Constantinides, chair of the City Councils Committee on Environmental Protection.When passed, this will be the largest carbon emissions reduction every mandated by any city, anywhere the first step in reimagining how we power and operate as a city.LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Climate Change So what finally got the job done?Thanks to scientific and governmental reports banging the drum, and superstorms putting New York temporarily underwater, more and more people understand that climate change is an existential threatespecially in coastal cities.But that doesnt mean every New Yorker is thrilled with the idea of capping skyscraper carbon emissions.Take, for example, the Real Estate Board of New York, which represents the owners of those skyscrapers who are going to have to pay for all these upgrades.For a piece of legislation that purports to be the most ambitious carbon reduction bill ever passed by a city, it actually exempts more than 50 percent of New Yorks built environment from its requirements, writes John Banks, REBNYs president, in a recent blog post.Residential buildings with rent control are exempt, as are hospitals and places of worship, and Banks organization insists that the long list of outs combined with the hard-line limits will discourage landlords from renting to energy-intensive but economically valuable users.The bill, Banks writes, is a repudiation of decades of public policy designed to promote job growth and housing production to address a growing population for New York City.REBNY supported an earlier, slow-pitched approach based on a buildings EnergyStar rating, a measure of energy efficiency.But that went out the windowpossibly because of political pressure from the left of the left thanks to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents portions of Queens and the Bronx in Congress.Now, I could write this in a couple of different ways, and both of them would be right: One is, by fronting for a Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez has shined a necessary, energy-efficient light on an emergent problem that threatens New York City and the world.Another is, Ocasio-Cortezs popularity places pressure on elected leaders whose districts overlap her own.If people voted for her, they might vote against someone whose platform included emitting more carbon.Which version is right?Eh.Embrace the and.The point is, at a time when the global superpower countries seem largely uninterested in cutting greenhouse gas emissionsdespite popular support for such changesthe policy weight falls on smaller political entities.That means regions, states, and cities.And what works in New York, if it works, could work in Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles, too.All it takes is the will.More Great WIRED Stories
China Finds Phone-Wielding Tourists and Telescopes Don't Mesh:::::If a giant telescope observes the universe, and no one around can take a picture of it, does it really exist?The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescopelocated in Guizhou, Chinawill have to find out.New regulations, put into effect in early April, ban (among other things) cell phones, smart wearables, drones, and digital cameras within 5 kilometers of the dish and impose uncomfortably large fines on those who break the rules.Officials ratified the restrictions because tourists flocked to the once-remote area after the government built science-centric attractions nearby and promoted the telescope as a vacation destination.But with tourists come electronics, and electronics emit radio waves.Those earthly waves can easily shout down the whispers from the cosmos.As WIRED reported in August 2018, the planned surge in visitors compromised the telescopes data.With the new, stricter regulations, China has both acknowledged the potential problems and taken steps to resolve them.Named FAST but nicknamed Sky Eye, Chinas Eye, Eye of Heaven, and Chinas Eye of Heaven, the telescope is so big it would take you about 20 minutes to circumnavigate it.That size makes it ultrasensitive to the radio waves that rain down from spacefrom black holes like the one that just got its first portrait, from remnants of exploded stars, from the chill gas where stars form, from the pulsars left when they die.It makes sense that people would want to get a piece of that.So, in a way, it makes sense that not far from the facility, the local government built what some call Astronomy Town: a brand-new, ground-up city with a FAST movie theater, a FAST museum, hotels, restaurants, and roads where no one needed roads before.The government hoped to lure hundreds of thousands of residents and tons of tourists to the historically poor province.But it was unclear whether that development could mesh with FASTs need for quiet.Scientists and officials had, since the beginning, taken steps to mitigate the visitor-induced interference, but the new rules dig more at the root of the problem.As state-run news agency Xinhua put it, A regulation in 2013 did not include details on how to prevent human activities from interfering with the operation of the giant dish.The new regulation is more specific on the management of visitors, delineates responsibilities for regulators, orders warning signposts to be established and requires local authorities to engage the public in maintaining an interference-free environment.Now, within 5 kilometers of the scope, there's a blanket electronics ban, and violations can result in fines up to 30,000 yuan, or around $4,500.Beyond thatin a doughnut ring about 5 to 10 kilometers outregulations ease slightly.And beyond that, from 10 to 30 kilometers in the distance, a peripheral zone has the loosest controls, which presumably mostly affect those who, like cell providers, would like to broadly broadcast signals.The maximum monetary penalty for producing harmful interference has gone up from 5,000 yuan (around $750) to 200,000 yuan (around $30,000), according to Xinhua and China Daily.China Daily also reported that the three counties closest to the FAST site have all adjusted their economic and social development plans and that Guizhou also scrapped a planned airport in Luodian county out of concern for possible electromagnetic interference.In early April, says from the Pingtang County government website, officials held meetings with local residents and workers to internalize the sense of responsibility and responsibility of protecting the [telescope].The rules and outreach efforts come just after the announcement of a new television show about FAST, which state-run Zhongxin reported in late February.FAST is not the only telescope around which governments clip human behavior and possessions.Near the Green Bank Telescope and an NSA listening post in the Appalachian Mountains, the US instituted a 13,000 square-mile radio-quiet zone.The Square Kilometre Arraya future telescope split between South Africa and Australiawill live in regulated zones on both continents.Unless you want to go to the far side of the Moon to build your telescope (and plenty of people do), a protected region of Earth is the best you can do.Enforceable laws keep pockets of Earth quiet for now and prevent future technology from intruding and crowding out information from the cosmosinformation like what is up with pulsars.These are fast-spinning, ultra-dense remnants of once-large stars that went supernova.And theyre FASTs current specialty, as a recent issue of Science China Physics, Mechanics & Astronomy makes clear.A ban on visitor pictures seems like a good trade for the telescopes continued ability to see pulsars and, you know, the rest of the universe.More Great WIRED Stories
Move Over, San Andreas: There’s an Ominous New Fault in Town:::::U.S. route 395 is a geologic master class disguised as a road.It runs north from the arid outskirts of Los Angeles, carrying travelers up to Reno along the eastern flank of the Sierra Nevada.On the way, they pass the black cinder cones of Coso Volcanic Field and the eroded scars of a mighty 19th-century earthquake near Lone Pine.In winter, drivers might see steam rising from Hot Creek, where water boils up from an active supervolcano deep underground.About an hour from the Nevada border, Mono Lake appears, with its bulbous and surreal mineral formations known as tufa towers.Even for someone with no particular interest in rocks, these are captivating, otherworldly sights.But for James Faulds, Nevadas state geologist, they are something moreclues to a great tectonic mystery unfolding in the American West.If hes right, all of this, from the wastes of the Mojave Desert to the night-lit casinos of Reno, will someday be beachfront property.For more than a century, the San Andreas Fault has been considered the undisputed heavyweight champion of large-scale deformation in the West.It is here that the North American and Pacific Plates meet, jostling for position with often violent results.Eventually, the theory goes, the thin sliver of land between the fault and the oceanfrom the southern tip of the Baja Peninsula to the Santa Cruz Mountainswill break off from the mainland and slide north, until LA drifts past San Francisco.But theres at least one problem with this scenario: The San Andreas appears to have gotten jammed.Northwest of LA, near the town of Frazier Park, the fault is kinked out of alignment so dramatically that many geologists suspect the pent-up tectonic strain will have to seek release somewhere else.Related Stories Mexico Citys Earthquake Alert Worked.The Rest of the Country Wasnt So Lucky The Race to Understand Antarcticas Most Terrifying Glacier The Tricky Ethics of the Lucrative Disaster Rescue Business Faulds thinks hes found the spot.Its an emerging zone of instability, known as the Walker Lane, that closely follows Route 395.He believes that, over the next 8 million to 10 million years, the North American continent will unzip along this stretch of land, east of the San Andreas.The Gulf of California, which separates the Baja Peninsula from Mexico, will surge north into Nevada, turning thousands of square miles of dry land into ocean floor.(Mapmakers, if they still exist, may label the new body of water the Reno Sea.)While this geologic realignment will take long enough for human civilization to fall, rise, and fall again hundreds of times over, Faulds hypothesis is more than an academic curiosity.It represents a radical shift in how geologists use up-to-the-minute toolssatellite data, aerial surveys, computer simulationsto fathom age-old processes.And for residents of the West, it is an invitation to think in an altogether new way about the familiar-seeming ground beneath them.Now is the time: Already the Walker Lane region, with its booming population and burgeoning tech economy, is beginning to feel the rumblings of a new seismic regime.Many of Faulds colleagues dismiss his idea as controversial, fundamentally unprovable, or even simply wrong.It may be difficult to persuade them otherwise: Unlike the San Andreas, which is visible from space, the Walker Lane has yet to form a single, continuous line across the landscape.Still, Faulds has a pretty good idea of where it begins.Using a combination of old-fashioned fieldwork and modern technologies, he is now busily trying to find the rest.Last fall, I drove the nearly 500 miles up Route 395 from LA to Reno to meet him and learn how his tectonic premonition might come to pass.On a recent trip to Nevadas Pyramid Lake, geologist James Faulds explores what he believes may become the future continental edge of North America.Tabitha Soren Faulds picked me up outside my hotel early one morning in a Chevy Tahoe.Strips of neon light cast garish shades of pink and purple over the empty sidewalks.At 61, he bears the boyish expression of a man who remains enthusiastic about his lifes work, who still relishes looking for unusual things in the world around him.We were about to spend a few days hiking through light rain, cold and exposed, and Faulds had come prepared.Laminated geologic maps and layers of warm outerwear were piled high in the back of the SUV, and a generous selection of salty chips and chocolate cookies was stashed behind the drivers seat.Our destination that day was a trio of faults near Pyramid Lake, roughly a 35-mile drive northeast of Reno.The three features appear to be related, Faulds said, and seeing them would give me a good sense of how the larger Walker Lane is taking shape.As we headed out of town, he began miming different kinds of fault configurations, rubbing his knuckles together or abruptly knocking one palm against the other.Wrapped up in talk of subduction zones and transform boundaries, he took his hands off the steering wheel for a bit too long and the SUV began to drift.We hit a rumble strip.Oh, those, uhtheyre much closer to the road here than you think, he said apologetically.A mile or two later, it happened again.Although Faulds is now the leading advocate of the Walker Lane hypothesis, he is not the first person to suggest that something big is coming to the region.There was a lot of work done previously that planted some seeds, he told me.In the late 1980s, Stanford geologist Amos Nur coauthored a paper speculating that the San Andreas Fault might be looking for a new outlet in the Mojave Desert.Several years later, a strong 7.3-magnitude earthquake near the town of Landers, California, supplied compelling evidence that Nur might be right: Following that quake, a string of mysterious aftershocks rumbled up the Eastern Sierra, illuminating a network of faults that geologists had not previously thought were connected.This was the Walker Lane.Nur published his paper in the midst of a revolution in geodesy, the study of Earths shape and orientation in space.Geodesists make precise measurements of where landforms are at any given momentmountain peaks, ocean basins, remote islands, entire continents.For them, the planets crust resembles an Arctic ice floe, a slow-motion drift that masquerades as solid ground simply because our lives are too short for us to notice the movement.When GPS satellite data was made available to the general public in the 1980s, geodesists saw an opportunity.They began installing fixed GPS monitoring stations, called benchmarks, out in the landscape, then waiting patiently to see how each one moved over time.For geologists, seeing the Walker Lane for the first time was like discovering that a quarter of the Mississippi River is somewhere out in Colorado.In the 1990s, Nevada received funding from the US Department of Energy to install an unusually dense network of benchmarks in the southwest part of the state.This was not because the feds were worried about the overnight rupture of a new continental margin, but because they were hoping to bury the nation's nuclear waste beneath Yucca Mountain.Radioactive materials were meant to be entombed there for hundreds of thousands of years, and the DOE wanted to ensure the site was safe.(The project was shelved because of political squabbling, though it's resuscitated from time to time.)An unexpected benefit of the new sensor network was that it opened a window on the Walker Lane.The results were astonishing.GPS stations indicated that only about 75 percent of the tectonic movement between the Pacific and North American Plates was actually occurring along the San Andreas Fault.Much of the remaining 25 percent was bypassing the San Andreas and roaring up the Eastern Sierra, toward Reno, along the Walker Lane.For geologists, it was like discovering that a quarter of the Mississippi River is somewhere out in Colorado.Boy, the GPS data really revolutionized our thinking, Faulds said.Almost overnight, plate tectonics was no longer something geodesists had to speculate about with fieldwork or maps; it had become something they could watch unfold in real time.GPS technology is now capable of recording millimeter-scale changes in the landscape, accurate enough to measure the growth rate of a human fingernail.The past 30 years' worth of data has been breathtaking enough, but in another few decades GPS geodesy is likely to reshape our entire understanding of Earth's crust.Every geodesist I spoke with described the field with a barely contained sense of awe and excitement.SIGN UP TODAY Get the Backchannel newsletter for the best features and investigations on WIRED.Yet the discovery did not, as one might expect, trigger a surge of interest in the Walker Lane.Scott Bennett, of the US Geological Survey, told me that practically 99 percent of geologists still consider the San Andreas to be the single most dominant plate boundary in the American West.In this sense, Faulds' idea makes him an outlier.But, Bennett added, just look at a map.The zone stretching away from the Salton Sea, where the San Andreas begins, up into the southern part of the Walker Lane has been quite seismically active of late.Something must be going on there.When I asked Caltech geologist Brian Wernicke, a giant in the field of global geophysics, if it was possible that Faulds was paying too much attention to the Walker Lane, he replied, quickly and without irony: Well, it's the most interesting place in the world.In terms of understanding how continents deform and how seismic hazards relate to plate tectonics, he added, it's an unparalleled natural laboratory.As Faulds and I neared Pyramid Lake, he brought up the work of Tanya Atwater, widely considered a visionary in the field of plate tectonics.In the 1980s, Atwater began creating a series of animations depicting the birth and evolution of the San Andreas Fault.They suggest a precedent, Faulds said, for what is happening along the Walker Lane.Early on in the animations, it appears that the modern-day Baja Peninsula is destined to remain a part of the North American Plate; then, at about 7 million years ago, it abruptly cleaves away, creating the Gulf of California.This shift, Faulds said, was largely due to the presence of a chain of old volcanoes on the inland side of the San Andreas.They warmed and softened the continental crust, creating a line of weak spots like the perforations between two rows of postage stamps.That's where the land ripped apart.An uncannily similar situation may be playing out today, Faulds told me.As you head north from the Gulf of California into the Mojave Desert, an area known as the Eastern California Shear Zone, you pass scores of beautiful old volcanic craters and lava tubes.These features, many of which have become popular hiking destinations, form a line of perforation all the way up the Eastern Sierra, right along the highway that brought me to Reno.Ultimately, Faulds said, what I like about putting all the geological data together like this is that it makes so much damn sense.I joked that learning about the Walker Lane was like being seismically red-pilled: Once you see it, you can't go back.West Coast, Stressed Coast As the North American and Pacific Plates jostle for position, where will the growing tectonic pressure find an outlet?Walter Baumann Walter Baumann Pyramid lake is a remote, unearthly place ringed with tufa towers.It is located on a reservation belonging to the Paiute people, who consider it sacred.A mere 13,000 years ago, well within the time frame of human habitation in the West, it was part of an immense inland sea called Lake Lahontan.Since at least then, a series of linear features has been emerging south and west of the current water's edge.These features, known as the Pyramid Lake Fault, the Honey Lake Fault, and the Warm Springs Valley Fault, are almost impossible to see from the ground.They show up clearly in satellite imagery, however, as strange lines cutting many miles through the bare, rolling landscape.Faulds believes they may be on track to connect eventually.None have become the alpha fault, he told me.Yet.Faulds and several of his colleagues at the University of Nevada, Reno, have spent much of the past two decades out in the field, attempting to map these evolving faults.In some ways, their work resembles a forensic investigation.With every new crime scene, usually an ancient or recent earthquake, they try to reconstruct what happened.They identify a suspect (in this case, a specific fault) and even establish motive: Why here?Why now?Although today's researchers have voluminous digital evidence at their disposal, Faulds is always seeking tangible proofproof he can hit with a hammer.He wants to find the faults and folds that he seems named to discover.After a brief hike around the Pyramid Lake Fault, we headed west into the backcountry toward Warm Springs, where geodesist Bill Hammond and paleoseismologist Rich Koehler were working with a pair of grad students.We found them standing inside a fault trench, a 50-foot-long cut in the ground dug by a backhoe, perpendicular to the fault.It was a kind of diagnostic incision, meant to reveal the layers, or strata, within.One of Koehler's students was flying a drone overhead snapping photos of the trench.Both Hammond and Koehler work with Faulds at the university, which has quietly become a powerhouse of large-scale tectonic thinking.Hammond, for example, is responsible for much of the geodetic work transforming how researchers understand landscape movement in the American West.When I met him, he was preparing himself and his family for a long sabbatical overseas.My biggest fear, he confessed, is that there will be a huge earthquake while we're gone and I'll miss it.It would be like a bird-watcher missing a rare hawk he has been waiting his whole life to see.Hammond, who sports curly hair and a lingering grin, is less obsessed with the Walker Lane than Faulds is, though he sees no harm in exploring it as a hypothesis.Tufa towers at Mono Lake.Tabitha Soren Coso Volcanic Field.Tabitha Soren Koehler has the laid-back attitude of a surfer, even when he's heavily wrapped in winter layers.When I met him, he was holding a delicate Japanese gardening hoe, which he explained was unusually good for the work of clearing and analyzing the dense strata of sand, gravel, and dirt that mark a fault's history.He crouched and demonstrated his scraping technique.This, Koehler said, pointing casually to a line in the ground, was the fault itself.I looked down and noticed I had one foot placed on either side.For a moment, I caught a glimpse of the vast timescales that geologists inhabit: Millions of years from now, the Pacific Ocean could come roaring through.In spite of painstaking fieldwork like this and ever-more-detailed geodetic data, reactions to Faulds' work remain mixed.The Walker Lane hypothesis has been criticized as pure speculation, a future scenario that can never truly be tested.Yet for Atwater, the UC Santa Barbara geologist, it is too good not to be true.Laughing with excitement, Atwater told me that, in the past few decades, the tectonic evidence has become simply overwhelming.It's got to be true, she said.When I later told Faulds about Atwater's enthusiasm, he actually gasped.Oh!he replied, brightening.Ten years ago, she wouldn't have said that.Still, Faulds and other proponents of the Walker Lane hypothesis have a lot to prove before their idea goes mainstream.We left the fault trench at sunset.Deep shadows began to creep across the desolate slopes all around us, the raking light emphasizing the anomalous straight line of the Warm Springs Fault.As the dark band advanced, I had the sensation of watching Faulds' vision come to lifea hidden tectonic presence growing clearer.Yet the route back to Reno, which looped west through California into the red-flaring horizon, reminded me that he still has a challenging problem to solve: Where does the Walker Lane go next?Sooner or later, all these not-yet-alpha faults must reach the Pacific, either through northern California and Oregon or along the bottom edge of Washington state.Nearly as soon as you head west from Nevada, though, the landscape becomes forested.Remote, minor faults like the one at Warm Springs are lost beneath the brush and trees.That's where lidar comes in.Laser-based radar is a tool of spectacular visual clarity, able to image textures down to a scale of square feet.Like GPS geodesy, it is beginning to revolutionize tectonic research.And because it can penetrate vegetation, exposing features inaccessible to satellite cameras, it accelerates much of geology's grueling fieldwork.Among other things, lidar can pinpoint exactly where a fault trench should be dug.In the past year alone, high-resolution airborne lidar surveys over Nevada have revealed previously unmapped faults and the remains of ancient landslides.Faulds now hopes to perform further surveys throughout the presumed northern extent of the Walker Lane.When I visited him in his office at the university, he fired up an array of hard-drive-straining data sets.He pointed to the screen, tracing razor-straight lines across the forest floor and the edges of massive debris flows hidden by trees.Lidar is great for finding previously unknown faults, Faulds said.It's hard to get away from those in this area.There are faults everywhere.Hot Creek Geologic Site, California.Tabitha Soren Although a new continental edge won't rip through the American West for millions of years, the risks of a larger-than-expected earthquake along the Walker Lane are real, even today.There could be a high-magnitude temblor while you're reading this very article, but urban officialslet alone residentsseem oblivious to the potential threat.With the exception of Reno and a short list of towns, the region is isolated and sparsely populated.Indeed, it is home to several facilities situated there specifically to avoid contact with human beings, including two enormous depots where the US Army stores explosives and disposes of chemical waste.(An Army spokesperson declined to comment on what the effects of a major quake might be, but assured me there were monitoring systems in place.)The problem we have in Nevada is that people assume we're not very seismic, said Konrad Eriksen, president of Dynamic Isolation Systems, an engineering firm that specializes in earthquake-resistant designs.Whenever I talk to anybody in Reno, they just go, We're not seismic, and I know that's not true.In 2017, Eriksen said, he and a colleague dug up a map of all the large tremors in Nevada over the past 170 years.Anything bigger than a magnitude 4 is represented with an ominous red circle.Not coincidentally, many of the circles are clustered like a painful outbreak of smallpox right along the Walker Lane, several within driving distance of Reno.What it shows is that we're highly seismic, Eriksen told me.But awareness is very low.Until we have a big earthquake that does damage close to home, that won't change.Eriksen's offices are located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, the country's largest business park.TRIC covers more than 160 square milesthree San Franciscos' worthof sculpted valleys and rocky hills.Its tenants include Google, Switch, and Tesla, along with 2,000 protected wild horses.TRIC is as sure a sign as any that the Reno area is reinventing itself, aiming to attract younger residents who come not for strippers and slot machines but for lucrative jobs and easy access to the great outdoors.Lance Gilman, the bolo-tie-wearing, larger-than-life businessman behind the development, told me that on his first tour of the land he saw a bird's nest just sitting there on the ground, catching the light.He took it as a good omen, a sign of Reno's impending transition from has-been gambling den in the mountains to tech-centric boomtown.(Still, this is Nevada: At one point during the planning phase, Gilman had to assume management of the nearby Mustang Ranch brothelthe first ever licensed in the stateto stop a biker gang from moving in and marring his glorious vision.)One of Gilman's employees, a project manager named Kris Thompson, agreed to take me on a tour of the site.We started at Tesla's Gigafactory, which the company claims will be the largest building on the planet when completed.(It put us on the world stage overnight, Gilman told me.)Although still under construction, the Gigafactory was already so colossal that I could not make out its scale against the mountains beyond.As we drove on, Thompson directed my attention to the huge stone pads on which TRIC's industrial structures are being erected.We do not cut corners, he said.These pads have no subsidence.We have granite-basalt bedrock.For tech companies, that's great.(Eriksen seems to agree with this assessment: He and his colleagues have done nothing further to insulate their offices against quakes.)The lack of a seismic threat in this area is one of our strengths, Thompson continued.But, of course, there is a seismic threat.According to Faulds, it's about the same as what I already live with in California.The San Andreas may be closer to the breaking point, but the Walker Lane could see a major earthquake at any time.Thompson and I returned to TRIC's central office, where Gilman, now walled in by paperwork, was gearing himself up for several hours of new business calls.Last year, a company called Blockchains scooped up 67,000 acres of TRIC land to build a libertarian smart city.With that sale, the development had all but sold out.It was time, Gilman told me, to pursue new opportunities.We're in the path of growth, he said, as heavy trucks boomed by on the highway, shaking the earth.A GPS station north of Reno.Tabitha Soren
Estimate the Pulling Force of Boston Dynamics' Robo-Dog Army:::::When Boston Dynamics shares a new robot video, my robophobia levels increase just a little bit.I don't know why.There is something about these robots that get into the uncanny valley for me.This particular video is both fascinating and disturbing.It's fascinating because here are a bunch of robots pulling a truck (not a pickup trucka real truck).It's disturbing because it shows a BUNCH of robots.That's the beginning of a robot army.Perhaps the best way to calm myself is to consider the physics.Analyzing situations such as this is exactly what I like to do.If I combine something I like (physics) with something disturbing (robot army) maybe I will be OK.So, just how difficult is it to pull a truck like this?Is this something that only a robot can do, or could a small bunny rabbit also do it?The physics is mostly about friction.If you want to pull this massive truck, you both need high friction and you need low frictionyes, at the same time.What is friction?In a situation like this, there are actually two types of friction.There is the static friction between the pet robots' feet (maybe they aren't pets) and then there is the rolling friction between the tires of the truck and the road.Let's look at the static friction first.When you have two surfaces in contact with each other, there can be a lateral force that is parallel to their surfaces.This force is an interaction between the atoms in both materials.However, no one really wants to model in the interaction between 1026 atoms (or some huge number like that), so instead we just make a simpler model.A simple model of static friction works fairly well.It has the following features.There is a frictional force that is parallel to the contact of the two surfaces.The direction of this force is such that it opposes the relative motion of the surfaces (tries to prevent them from sliding).This frictional force applies whatever level of force is needed to prevent things from sliding.It's not a constant force, but rather a force of constraint.The maximum magnitude of this frictional force is proportional to the perpendicular force pushing the two surfaces together.We call this force the "normal force" where normal means perpendicular (at least that's true in geometry).The maximum magnitude of the frictional force is also proportional to a constant called the coefficient of static friction.This coefficient is a unitless value that depends on the two types of materials interaction (like rubber and asphalt in this case).Mathematically, this frictional force can be expressed as the following: Rhett Allain OK, the less-than-or-equal part makes it pretty tough to deal with friction.But since we are looking at the extreme cases, we can say that the robots are at the maximum friction (or close to it).Here is a force diagram for the lead dogbot while it is pulling on the rope.Rhett Allain Yes, all of those forces should add up to zero vector force.That's what you need to move at a constant velocity.Then why do you need to pull that truck at all?If you want it to move at a constant velocity, it shouldn't need any pulling force?Right?Yes, in an ideal situation you wouldn't need to pull the truck at all (once you got it moving).However, in this case there is also a frictional force on the truck.Also, this is not on flat ground (but I will get to that shortly).Let's estimate this maximum pulling force from one SpotMini robot (that's what they are called).According to Boston Dynamics, the robot has a mass of 25 kg.This means the weight and the normal force (since it's on flat ground) would be equal to 245 Newtons.Assuming a coefficient of 0.7 for the interaction between rubber and asphalt, the maximum frictional force would be 171.5 Newtons per bot.For 10 robot dogs, this would be 1715 Newtons.That's fairly significant.But why do you need to pull with any force?It's not because the truck is heavy; it's because there is also a frictional force on the truck.The truck isn't sliding, it's rolling.So we call this "rolling friction."It basically works the same way as normal friction, but it's actually due to the deformation in the tires and the friction in the wheel bearings as the truck rolls.It's pretty tough to estimate the coefficients (because it depends on lots of things), but I can do it anyway.This site lists the rolling coefficient of friction at around 0.02 for a tire on asphalt.Notice that this coefficient is much lower than the static coefficient for the robots.OK, I could draw the same diagram for the truck that I did for the robot.The only difference would the replacement of legs with wheels and the directions of the forces.In this case the frictional force is to the left and the tension in the rope is to the right.If you look at the video very carefully, you will see the GVW (gross vehicle weight) right there on the side of the truck.It lists a value of 26,000 (pounds) which is equivalent to 11793 kilograms.With this mass and rolling friction coefficient, you would have to pull with a force of 2311 Newtons.That's pretty close to the estimated friction from the robot dogs (maybe my values for the coefficients are off).What about pulling a truck uphill?Yes, that is much harder.However, going up hill has LESS friction.Let me draw an exaggerated incline with the forces on the truck.Rhett Allain In this case, the weight is still down but all the other forces have rotated to compensate for the angle of the incline.The important force here is the normal force.Since it's perpendicular to the plane but gravity is straight down, the normal force will only have a magnitude equal to the perpendicular component of the weight.As the incline increases in angle, the normal force decreases.Yup.With a decreased normal force, the friction decreases.But wait!The same thing happens for these 10 robot dogs.They also have a decrease in the frictional force needed to pull the truck up the incline.So does this suggest that it's just as easy to go up an incline as to go horizontal on flat ground?Nope.There is one other thing to consider.When going up hill, you don't just have to pull against friction but you also have to fight against a component of the gravitational force.Yes, at a 1 degree incline it might seem tiny.But the component of the gravitational force from the truck would be 2017 Newtons.This is almost as much force as the robodogs need to pull to overcome the rolling friction.OK, so how can we make it work?Clearly the robots are pulling the truck.Here are the things we could change: The mass of the truck.Maybe it's completely empty with a GWV of 20,000 pounds.The coefficient of friction for the robo puppers.Let's bump this up to 0.9.The coefficient of rolling friction.Maybe the tires are super pumped up.With these new values, the 10 robots can pull uphill with a total force of 2204 Newtons (I'm ignoring the extra force the robots need to get themselves up the hill) and the truck needs 2442 Newtons.Close enough.Hold on.Why am I helping the robots figure out this physics stuff?Shouldn't the robots be helping me?Is this just the first step of the robopocalypse?!More Great WIRED Stories
Crispr Gene Editing Is Coming for the Womb:::::William Peranteau is the guy parents call when theyve received the kind of bad news that sinks stomachs and wrenches hearts.Sometimes its a shadow on an ultrasound or a few base pairs out of place on a prenatal genetic test, revealing that an unborn child has a life-threatening developmental defect.Pediatric surgeons like Peranteau, who works at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia, usually cant try to fix these abnormalities until their patients leave their mothers bodies behind.And by then it might be too late.Its with the memory of the families he couldnt help in the back of his mind that Peranteau has joined a small group of scientists trying to bring the fast-moving field of gene editing to the womb.Such editing in humans is a long way off, but a spate of recent advances in mouse studies highlight its potential advantages over other methods of using Crispr to snip away diseases.Parents confronted with an in utero diagnosis are often faced with only two options: terminate the pregnancy or prepare to care for a child who may require multiple invasive surgeries over the course of their lifetime just to survive.Prenatal gene editing may offer a third potential path.What we see as the future is a minimally invasive way of treating these abnormalities at their genetic origin instead, says Peranteau.LEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Crispr To prove out this vision, Peranteau and colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania injected Crispr editing components, encoded in a virus, into the placentas of pregnant mice whose unborn pups were afflicted with a lethal lung-disease-causing mutation.When the fetuses breathed in the amniotic fluid they also inhaled the Crispr bits, which went to work editing the DNA inside their rapidly dividing alveolar progenitor cells.These cells give rise to many types of cells that line the lungsincluding ones that secrete a sticky substance that keeps the lungs from collapsing every time you breathe.Mutations to proteins that make up this secretion are a major source of congenital respiratory conditions.All of the mice with the mutation died within a few hours of birth.Of those edited with Crispr, about a quarter survived.The results were published in todays issue of Science Translational Medicine.Its the second proof of concept from the group of scientists in the past year.In October, they published a paper describing a slightly different procedure to edit mutations that lead to a lethal metabolic disorder.By changing a single base pair in the liver cells of prenatal mice, Peranteaus team was able to rescue nearly all of the mouse pups.Other recent successes include unborn mice cured of a blood disorder called beta-thalassemia following a prenatal injection of Crispr, carried out last year by a team at Yale and Carnegie Mellon.Though the field is still in its infancy, its pioneers believe that many of the problems Crispr-based therapies have to contend withlike reaching enough of the right cells and evading the human immune systemcan be solved by treating patients while they are still in the womb.If youre trying to edit cells in an adult organ, theyre not proliferating, so you have to reach a lot of them to have any impact, says Edward Morrisey, a cardiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, who coauthored the latest study.Fetuses, on the other hand, are still developing, which means their cells are in a state of rapid division as they grow into new tissues.The earlier in life you can edit, the more those genetic changes will multiply and propagate through developing organs.Morriseys mice might have only been born with the genetic edit in about 20 percent of their lung cells, but 13 weeks later, the correction had spread to the entire surface of the lung.Theyve actually outcompeted the nonedited cells, because those cells are very sick, says Morissey.For lung diseases in particular, this represents a huge advantage.As soon as a baby leaves the watery world of the womb, its lung cells start secreting a barrier of mucus mixed with surfactant, to keep any dust or viruses or other foreign objects, including Crispr components, from reaching those tissues.A developing fetus also has a less aggressive immune system than a human whos been exposed to the outside world.So its less likely to mount an attack on Crispr components, which do, after all, originate in the bacterial kingdom.Megan Molteni covers biotechnology, medicine, and genetic privacy for WIRED.Now, you might be thinking, if editing earlier is better, why not edit an embryo right after its been fertilized, when its only a cell or two old?But this technique, known as germline editing (you might remember it from last years Chinese Crispr baby scandal), is a much more complicated ethical endeavor.Editing at that stage would pass on any changes to every cell, including the ones that would go on to make sperm or eggs.This kind of editing is effectively banned in the United States, following a directive from Congress to the US Food and Drug Administration to not allow any clinical trials involving genetically modified human embryos.(The ban, which has to be renewed annually, was most recently reaffirmed in February of 2019).The other thing though, is that getting an accurate diagnosis when an embryo is only a few cells old can be tricky.Waiting long enough to get a visual on a fetus along with other vital signs can provide important clues as to the severity of the condition.It gets us right in that sweet spot to treat a disease at the very beginning, basically as soon as its diagnosed, says Peranteau.But there are still safety issues to resolve.For one thing, in utero editing involves two patients, not just one.In the process of curing a child, this technique would potentially expose a healthy bystanderthe motherto a treatment that provides no potential benefit and only potential risks, including dangerous immune reactions.And because the editing is taking place inside her reproductive tract, some wayward Crispr components might wend their way up her fallopian tubes and into her ovaries, potentially making changes to other, unfertilized eggs.A lot more science will need to be done to better assess these risks.To give you an idea of how long these things can take, consider that in utero gene therapyan older approach that entails replacing a defective gene with a functioning one using a viruswas first proposed back in the mid-1990s following a series of positive proof of concept studies in mice.Today, only a single clinical trial is in progress.This is not a panacea for curing every genetic disease thats out there, says Peranteau.But he believes that a Crispr approach will be able to piggyback on the work of the gene therapy field, and may offer a new way forward for at least some of his patients.At some point in the futurenot tomorrow or the next day, years from nowI think in utero editing would provide hope for families that today have none.More Great WIRED Stories
Offshore Wind Farms Are Spinning Up in the US—At Last:::::On June 1, the Pilgrim nuclear plant in Massachusetts will shut down, a victim of rising costs and a technology that is struggling to remain economically viable in the United States.But the electricity generated by the aging nuclear station soon will be replaced by another carbon-free source: a fleet of 84 offshore wind turbines rising nearly 650 feet above the ocean's surface.The developers of the Vineyard Wind project say their turbinesanchored about 14 miles south of Marthas Vineyardwill generate 800 megawatts of electricity once they start spinning sometime in 2022.Thats equivalent to the output of a large coal-fired power plant and more than Pilgrims 640 megawatts.Offshore wind has arrived, says Erich Stephens, chief development officer for Vineyard Wind, a developer based in New Bedford, Massachusetts, that is backed by Danish and Spanish wind energy firms.He explains that the costs have fallen enough to make developers take it seriously.Not only is wind power less expensive, but you can place the turbines in deeper water, and do it less expensively than before.Last week, the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities awarded Vineyard Wind a 20-year contract to provide electricity at 8.9 cents per kilowatt-hour.That's about a third the cost of other renewables (such as Canadian hydropower), and it's estimated that ratepayers will save $1.3 billion in energy costs over the life of the deal.Can offshore wind pick up the slack from Pilgrim and other fading nukes?Its proponents think so, as long they can respond to concerns about potential harm to fisheries and marine life, as well as successfully connect to the existing power grid on land.Wind power is nothing new in the US, with 56,000 turbines in 41 states, Guam, and Puerto Rico producing a total of 96,433 MW nationwide.But wind farms located offshore, where wind blows stead and strong, unobstructed by buildings or mountains, have yet to start cranking.In recent years, however, the turbines have grown bigger and the towers taller, able to generate three times more power than they could five years ago.The technology needed to install them farther away from shore has improved as well, making them more palatable to nearby communities.When it comes to wind turbines, bigger is better, says David Hattery, practice group coordinator for power at K&L Gates, a Seattle law firm that represents wind power manufacturers and developers.Bigger turbines and blades perform better under the forces generated by strong ocean winds.Turbulence wears out bearings and gear boxes, Hattery said.What you dont want offshore is a turbine that breaks down.It is very expensive to fix it.In the race to get big, Vineyard Wind plans to use a 9.5 MW turbine with a 174-meter diameter rotor, a giant by the standard of most wind farms.But GE last year unveiled an even bigger turbine, the 12 MW Haliade-X.When complete in 2021, each turbine will have a 220-meter wingspan (tip to tip) and be able to generate enough electricity to light 16,000 European homes.GE is building these beasts for offshore farms in Europe, where wind power now generates 14 percent of the continents electricity (compared to 6.5 percent in the US).We feel that we have just the right machine at just the right time, says John Lavelle, CEO of GE Renewable Energys Offshore Wind business.US officials say theres a lot of room for offshore wind to grow in US coastal waters, with the potential to generate more than 2,000 gigawatts of capacity, or 7,200 terawatt-hours of electricity generation per year, according to the US Department of Energy.That's nearly double the nations current electricity use.Even if only 1 percent of that potential is captured, nearly 6.5 million homes could be powered by offshore wind energy.Of course, getting these turbines built and spinning takes years of planning and dozens of federal and state permits.The federal government made things a bit easier in the past five years with new rules governing where to put the turbines.The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (a division of the Department of Interior) now sets boundaries for offshore leases and accepts bids from commercial enterprises to develop wind farms.The first offshore project was a 30 MW, five-turbine wind farm that went live at the end of 2016.Developed by Deepwater Wind, the installation replaced diesel generators that once serviced the resorts of Block Island, Rhode Island.Now there are 15 active proposals for wind farms along the East Coast, and others are in the works for California, Hawaii, South Carolina, and New York.By having federal planners determine where to put the turbines, developers hope to avoid the debacle that was Cape Wind.Cape Wind was proposed for Nantucket Sound, a shallow area between Nantucket, Marthas Vineyard, and Cape Cod.Developers began it with high hopes back in 2001, but pulled the plug in 2017 after years of court battles with local residents, fishermen, and two powerful American families: the Kennedys and the Koch brothers, both of whom could see the turbines from their homes.Like an extension cord that wont reach all the way to the living room, Cape Winds developers were stuck in Nantucket Sound because existing undersea cables were limited in length.But new undersea transmission capability means the turbines can be located further offshore, away from beachfront homes, commercial shipping lanes, or whale migration routes.Even though cables can stretch further, somebody still has to pay to bring this electricity back on land, says Mark McGranaghan, vice president of integrated grid for the Electric Power Research Institute.McGranaghan says that in Denmark and Germany the governments pay for these connections and for the offshore electrical substations that convert the turbines alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) for long-distance transmission.Here in the US, he predicts these costs will likely have to be paid by utility ratepayers or state taxpayers.Offshore wind is totally real and we know how to do it, McGranaghan says.One of the things that comes up is who pays for the infrastructure to bring the power back.It's not just money.Offshore wind developers must also be sensitive to neighbors who dont like power cables coming ashore near their homes, fishermen who fear they will be shut out from fishing grounds, or environmental advocates who worry that offshore wind platform construction will damage sound-sensitive marine mammals like whales and dolphins.Still, maybe that's an easier job than finding a safe place to put all the radioactive waste that keeps piling up around Pilgrim and the nation's 97 other nuclear reactors.More

The Odd Physics of Rey's Backflip in Star Wars: Episode IX:::::What the heck does "The Rise of Skywalker" even mean?Some people hate trailers because they spoil the plot.For me, it's more like an appetizer to get me ready for the show.Of course, in this case I'm talking about Star Wars IX: The Rise of Skywalker.Since you know I'm a huge geek for both Star Wars and physics, I have to do some type of analysis on this trailer.That's just what I do.How about a look at Rey's backflip over a low-flying TIE fighter?My weapon of choice in this post will be video analysis (using Tracker Video Analysis).The idea is to look at the x- and y-position (in units of pixels) of an object in each frame of the video.With this, I can get position and time data to do whatever analysis I want.For Rey jumping over (I assume she makes it) a TIE fighter, I'm just going to look at her vertical motion.Once she leaves the ground, it would just be normal physics projectile motion with a vertical acceleration equal to the local gravitational field for that planet.These kinds of analysis come up quite oftenand there are three things you could consider.The vertical acceleration.On Earth, this is -9.8 m/s 2 ..The distance scale.How many pixels of video in one meter of distance?The time scale.What is the length of time for each frame?If you know two of these three things, you can find the third.Here you can see there is a problem.I'm pretty sure I can get a distance scale by using the height of Rey (or the size of the TIE fighter).But what about the other two?It seems I should stay away from the time scale.The trailer shows her acrobatic leap in slow motion (apparently for effect).But since it's in slow motion, the viewed frame rate (what the user sees) is different than the "real" rate.Yes, I know Star Wars is not real.I only have one hope.One last hope.I am going to have to assume the vertical acceleration is equal to -9.8 m/s2 just like on Earth.It's not a crazy assumption.First, all the motions of people look like they would on Earth.Second, most of this movie was probably filmed on Earth.I think it's a safe assumption.Now for the analysis.I'm going to look at the vertical position of Rey in each frame.For this clip, I also need to adjust for the motion of the camera.We can compensate for this camera motion by looking at the apparent motion of the background.Actually, Tracker Video Analysis has some nice tools to take care of this (with a little bit of work).Let's start with a plot of Rey's vertical position as a function of "time"remember, it's not real time.Tracker Video Analysis This is strange.Strange that a person is jumping over a flying spacecraft on an alien planet?No.It's strange that her vertical velocity is essentially two constant segments.Here is what it would look like with a human jumping up (same height) on the surface of the Earth.Note: This is a calculation in python.You can see the code by clicking the pencil icon.Yes, this curve is the shape of a parabola.The data from the clip IS NOT a parabola.Don't worry, it's OK. Maybe Rey is using The Force or something to make this jump (she probably is).But there is still some useful stuff here.First, she jumps at least 2 meters highthat's the change in height of her center of mass.That's an impressive jump.Second, if this jump was on Earth, moving up that high would take at least 0.5 seconds.In the clip, the motion takes 1.9 seconds.Right off the bat, you could estimate that this is slowed down by a factor of 4 (approximately).How about we jump to the analysis of the horizontal motion?Oh, maybe I should point out something odd about this scene.There is some type of TIE fighter zooming toward Rey.You would think her goal is to jump over the spacecraft, but who really knows.Here is the weird partshe starts off running in the same direction as the TIE fighter.Even though she runs fairly slowly compared to a spacecraft, this will decrease the relative velocity between her and the ship (since they are running in the same direction).Now, when she jumps over the TIE, it will take longer for it to pass under her.This means she would need to jump even higher to clear it and stay in the air longer.You know what I'm talking about.You've seen these epic videos of people jumping over speeding sports cars.They run toward the car, not away.But maybe she is trying to land on top of the TIE fighter.Like I said, who knows.OK, here is a plot of her horizontal position during this time.Tracker Video Analysis What is going on here?For normal projectile motion, once an object is in the air there is only the downward gravitational force.This means that with zero horizontal force the object (or Jedi) should move at a constant horizontal velocity.Rey moves with a constant horizontal velocity and then moves at a different horizontal velocity.Honestly, I think everything is OK here.I suspect that the slow motion frame rate changed in the middle of the jumpI'm OK with that.Let me end with some preemptive comments.I know your questions and comments before you even ask them."Chill dude.Don't you even realize that this is a movie about a fictional planet with a fictional person?It's not even science fiction, it's space fantasy."Yes.I do indeed understand that this is not real.However, I really like physics and I really like Star Wars.What's wrong with mixing the two together?What if you really like chocolate milk?Would it be so bad to make Star Warsthemed chocolate milk?Yes.I do indeed understand that this is not real.However, I really like physics and I really like Star Wars.What's wrong with mixing the two together?What if you really like chocolate milk?Would it be so bad to make Star Warsthemed chocolate milk?"You never told us the speed of the TIE fighter."That is correct.I left that out.I can plot the horizontal position of the spacecraftbut I don't know the time scale (I'm assuming it's in slow motion).If you really need a value, I'm going to give it to you.Suppose it takes 0.5 seconds for Rey to jump (even though she doesn't really jump).From video analysis, the TIE fighter moves about 5 meters.This puts the speed at 25 m/s (56 mph).Oh, but add on the fact that Rey is running.If she is running at 4 m/s, then the TIE fighter would be going 29 m/s (65 mph).Still pretty slow for a spacecraft.That is correct.I left that out.I can plot the horizontal position of the spacecraftbut I don't know the time scale (I'm assuming it's in slow motion).If you really need a value, I'm going to give it to you.Suppose it takes 0.5 seconds for Rey to jump (even though she doesn't really jump).From video analysis, the TIE fighter moves about 5 meters.This puts the speed at 25 m/s (56 mph).Oh, but add on the fact that Rey is running.If she is running at 4 m/s, then the TIE fighter would be going 29 m/s (65 mph).Still pretty slow for a spacecraft.How does Rey jump up and move at a constant speed?Um ... she uses The Force?Um ... she uses The Force?How fast would a human have to jump to clear this TIE fighter?Didn't I already do this?Well, if not, then it's your homework question.Didn't I already do this?Well, if not, then it's your homework question.The title for Episode IX is The Rise of Skywalker.Which Skywalker?Exactly the question I have.I guess we will have to wait for the movie.Exactly the question I have.I guess we will have to wait for the movie.Don't you have more important things to do with your time?Nope.I'm here just for Star Wars and physics.I already answered this.More Great WIRED Stories
Colorado Tried a New Way to Vote: Make People Pay—Quadratically:::::The Democratic caucus of the Colorado State House of Representatives had a problembut it was the good kind.The 20181 election put Democrats in charge of the House, the State Senate, and the governorship.Now it was time to decide, out of somewhere between 60 and 100 appropriations bills, which policies to fund first.But well, you know how Democrats are, right?The only thing they really agree on is that the most efficient shape for a firing squad is a circle.The state reps could have just voted, of course, but each of those 41 Democrats in the House was probably the sponsor of at least one of those bills.So theyd vote out of self-interest.No help there.What the Dems needed was a way to capture desire, to know which bills were everyones priority.We have a limited pot of money to spend on new legislation every year, says Chris Hansen, a state representative from Denver and chair of the House Appropriations Committee.So we needed to devise a method for accurately capturing the preference of those caucus members.Hansen isnt just a pol.Hes a PhD energy economist with an interest in game theory.Hes open to weird science, is the point.So a pal of his, hearing about his plight, told him about a new idea: quadratic voting.The result of some concept work by a Microsoft Research economist named Glen Weyl, quadratic voting is designed to force people to express their honest opinions about their choices by attaching a cost.One vote costs one unit of valuein its purest form, you would literally buy that vote with your own hard-earned American dollars.But not so fast, because the cost of a vote increasesby the number of votes times itself, to be precise.(That's the "quadratic" part.)2 So two votes cost four dollars; three votes cost nine.Ten votes?One hundred dollars.The point is, you can yell as loudly as you want, but louder yelling costs moreso you have to be really incentivized to do it.Fundamentally, quadratic voting addresses the problem of the tyranny of the majority, a standard criticism of democracy, Weyl says.Standard rules are based on the notion that everybody is exactly the same and cares the same amount.If you doubt thats a problem, think about the plight of African Americans in the United States, or the drug war, which dramatically affects certain groups of people.But with quadratic voting, you can vote harder on whats closer to home.And when the vote is over, all the money in the pot gets distributed to each voter equally, which is supposed to sort of re-grade the playing field for next time.Like a lot of other similarly intricate ideas, quadratic voting sets out to solve a fundamental problem in the field of social choice, which is to say, how groups of people choose what they want.It may seem like the purest solution is one-person-one-vote, sometimes delightfully abbreviated as 1p1v.But it doesnt work as well as it should.Like, a plurality election is where the candidate with the most votes wins, but when you have multiple candidates, its possible for someone to get a small number of votes but still win if his or her total was higher than the next candidate down.(That happens in a crowded presidential primary.)The American Electoral College system allocates points on a state-by-state, winner take all basis, which means someone can lose the 1p1v popular vote by quite a lot and still win.(Hello, Mr.President.)And in the US, slightly more than half of voters, or half of congress, can enforce their will over the other less-than-halfeven if the numbers are really close or the will is really disproportionate.Plenty of other options exist.In a Borda Count, named after the French scientist Jean-Charles de Borda, people put candidates in order of preference.Theres an approach called antiplurality, where everyone chooses their least favorite candidate, and whoever gets the fewest votes wins.And what youd like in any multi-choice election is for the Condorcet winner to also be the actual winnerwhich is to say, the thing that would beat all other things in head-to-head races should also win the overall race.So for example, all other concerns aside, in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump beat a lot of other people.Then Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton.But would Clinton have lost to Jeb Bush?Would Bernie Sanders have lost to Trump?What?Too soon?In any case, this is all hard to fix in practice.Maybe evenas the 1950s economist Kenneth Arrow proposedimpossible.In fact, he won a Nobel Prize for his perhaps-too-on-the-nosedly named Arrows Impossibility Theorem, which says eh, you can probably guess.Arrow came up with a bunch of criteria for an election that let everyone express their personal truth but didnt let weird counting methods screw a choice unfairly, and showed with math that no method would allow it to happen.Democracy!So bad, right?So people have suggested approaches to make democracy less impossible.Cities in the California Bay Area frequently use ranked choice voting, which can lead to its own kind of confusion while counts get redone as candidates get knocked out of the running, as happened last year in San Francisco.Approval voting fulfills Arrows criteria and isnt impossible, so a lot of professional societies use it to elect their leadership.3 Hansen and the Colorado Democrats had tried to solve these kinds of problems before.Last year they arbitrarily assigned everyone 15 tokens to put on their 15 favorite bills.This might work for priorities at a company retreat, but for budgeting, it didnt give us as good a signal, Hansen says.So after talking to Weyl and working with software developers he knew, the caucus put together a computer interface to serve a modified version of quadratic voting.No dollars here.The members werent using their own moneyeach of them got 100 virtual tokens to buy votes.And unlike Weyls original version, the tokens didnt get redistributed to all the voters at the end.So in mid-April, the representatives voted.Sure, each one could have put ten tokens on their pet project.But consider the or: Nine votes on one (cost: 81 tokens) but then three votes on another (cost: nine tokens).Or five votes each (25 tokens) on four different bills!In Colorado at least, it worked, kind of.There was a pretty clear signal on which items, which bills, were the most important for the caucus to fund, Hansen says.The winner was Senate Bill 85, the Equal Pay for Equal Work Act, with 60 votes.And then theres kind of a long tail, Hansen says.The difference was much more clear with quadratic voting.This use case is somewhat unusual, of course.The bills still have to get past the Senate and get signed by the Governornot impossible, with all Democrats in charge.As a test case, the appropriations vote at least advances the hypothesis that quadratic voting (or some other equally tricksy system) could improve the American Experiment.Maybe the nations seemingly intractable political divisions arent a product of Russians, racism, and algorithms but a system that doesnt let everyone speak with an authentic voice.Many of these methods have advantages, and most of the experts agree that those other methods are preferable, says Dan Ullman, a mathematician who teaches a mathematics and policy class at George Washington University and, to be clear, thinks the Electoral College is pretty dumb.Quadratic voting, though?Im not so persuaded, Ullman says.Its very different from one person, one vote, and cost-free voting is very American, in my opinion.It seems like people value the right to vote as something that is intrinsic, that it doesnt cost anything and youre allowed to express yourself as loudly as you want.To be even clearer, in reality you probably dont want people to be able to buy influence.Quadratic voting would potentially be a real friend to, for example, the not-in-my-backyard side of density fights, where a minority that cares deeply about a vacant lot might be actively jeopardizing the welfare of the majority.And these problems get even worse in a system corrupted by pricey lobbyists and dark-money campaign contributions.Some people already pay for a louder voice.Weyl acknowledges this; he says the first approximate uses of quadratic votes should probably use an artificial currency like the Colorado tokensat least until all of us are on the same level of Universal Basic Income and have the same starting-point bank account.(This might be why some blockchain advocates have embraced the idea.)The truth is, no one actually lives in one person, one vote.Its like an imaginary thing, Weyl says.Things like municipalities, electoral colleges, and bicameral legislatures are really just improvisatory compromises.So we think, oh, the problem is we dont have enough democracy.But if you can actually solve it with a general-purpose solution, you dont need all these kludgy things that solve it really poorly.Fixing democracy sounds difficultbut not impossible.1 Updated 4/22/19 9:45 AM PDT Fixed date2 Updated 4/16/19 10:30 AM PDT Fixed the

The Notre Dame Fire and the Future of History:::::Some of the wood that burned in the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris on Monday was put in place in the year 1160.The beams and exterior of the roof over the nave, the long main section of the building, date from between 1220 and 1240.Nearly a millennium ago it was forest; today, after a catastrophe that cuts to the heart of French culture and human history, its ash.It was one of the oldestuntil todaysurviving roofs of that kind, says Robert Bork, an architectural historian at the University of Iowa.Its incomparable.The fire began Monday evening, around 6:30 pm, in the churchs attic.The buildings familiar towers and flying buttresses loomed over the Ile de la Cit for centuries, prompting the author Victor Hugo to locate Notre Dame not only at the literal center of the city of Paris but also at its historical center, as a symbol.Flames and a column of smoke made it even more striking, and as the flames spread the potential impact of the blaze became more clear.President Emmanuel Macron canceled a speech.Four hundred firefighters mustered.The cathedrals lead-and-wood spire, built by Eugne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc in 1860 as part of a controversial remodel, caught fire and fell.By Monday night, the art and treasured objects kept in the cathedral had been saved, it seemed.But architectural historians around the world were emailing each other frantically: If the lower three-quarters of the building resist, if the stone walls stand, itll be possible to imagine restoring Notre Dame.If the fire burns out while the stone vaults are intact, then the repair is a repair, Bork says.If the vaults start to crack and fall down, then the building is going to be lost.Wed be talking about rebuilding, not a repair.Parisian fire brigades held the line.They kept the fire from spreading into the towers of the western face of the cathedral.The wooditself an architectural treasurewas lost.Cathedrals like Chartres had all burned off, Bork says.This was quite special, and it was from the time that they were really developing roof techniques.But the rest of the building seems to have been spared.As a landmark, Notre Dame lives on in uncountable drawings, paintings, and photographs, not to mention the memories of people who visited, worshipped, and listened to music amid its incomparable acoustics.But because it survived largely intact into the digital era, Notre Dame lives on in the virtual world, tooand that may make its restoration all the more complete.For the last half-decade or so, an architectural historian named Andrew Tallon worked with laser scanners to capture the entirety of the cathedrals interior and exterior in meticulous 3D point clouds.His billion points of light revealed a living structure; the magnificent flying buttresses had indeed held the walls true, but the Gallery of Kings, statues on the western facade, were a foot out of plumb, Tallon told National Geographic in 2015.Just as it had in Victor Hugo's day, the entire building had in fact fallen into disrepair by then.In 2017, the problems became too serious to ignore.The New York Times reported on stacks of masonry, fallen or removed, in the gardens.Gargoyles had given way to plastic pipes to drain away rainwater.A remodel was imperative, though as Time reported, it wasnt clear who would pay for it.This is the renovation project that was underway when the fire started, and architects now hope that Tallons scans may provide a map for keeping on track whatever rebuilding will have to take place.Tallon died late last year, and his mentor, a pioneer in using modern engineering forensics in historic architecture named Robert Mark, died in early 2019.Both of them loved this building, Bork says.Im just glad they didnt have to see this.As for what happens next, no one seems sure yet.In a statement, Macron insisted the cathedral would be rebuilt.And even if France finds the money to do so, what exactly will that entail?An exact copy, perhaps using Tallons scans?Something different?This has not ever happened before in my lifetime, so I dont have a paradigm to go to, Bork says.Original hand craftsmanship is irreplaceable.When you restore it, its not exactly the same thing.You lose information.You can tell sometimes when a stone has been carved by the kind of chisel marks on it.You can tell sometimes the chemical content of the mortar.That texture and detailand the knowledge to be gained by studying itis what a fire burns away.A new wall doesnt contain any of that, even if it looks exactly like what once stood.Do we clean it up and make it all look unified, or do we try to let the memory remain?Bork asks.Every time they have a cathedral that needs restoration and tender loving care, theres the question of, do you make it Disneyland, or do you let it decay?In this case, God willing, the cathedral will have some of its original structure left, and theyll put it back as best as they can.More Great WIRED Stories
First Big Survey of Births Finds Millions of Missing Women:::::Every time a man ejaculates, he produces somewhere between 40 million and 1.2 billion sperm.About half of those tiny swimmers carry an X chromosome and about half carry a Y.So youd think that the odds that one or the other would be the first to fertilize an egg would be about the same as a coin flip.And yet, for as long as people have been keeping records, nature shows a different, dependable pattern: For every 100 babies born biologically female, 105 come out biologically male.Scientists have speculated this mysteriously male-biased sex ratio is evolutions way of evening things out, since females consistently outlive their XY-counterpartsfor every man that reaches the age of 100, four women have also joined the Century Club.This biological maxim has been so drilled into the heads of demographersthe researchers responsible for keeping tabs on how many people there are on the planetthat most dont think twice before plugging it into any projections theyre making about how populations will change in the future.But a massive effort to catalog the sex ratios at birth, for the first time, for every country, shows thats not such a smart strategy after all.For so long people just took that number for granted, says Fengqing Chao, a public health researcher at the Institute of Policy Studies in Singapore.But no one had ever gone to the trouble of pulling all this information together to get accurate estimates of this fundamental metric.Chao led the five-year project, combing through decades of census data, national survey responses, and birth records to build models that could estimate national sex ratios across time.In doing so, she and her collaborators at the United Nations discovered that in most regions of the world, sex ratios diverge significantly from the historical norm.Across a dozen countries, the chasm amounts to 23.1 million missing female births since 1970.The results, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, provide an unprecedented look at how societal values can skew the laws of nature.Its an incredibly important contribution, says Darrell Bricker, a Canadian political scientist.If the only part of the population who can produce new kids are women under the age of 45, and a whole bunch of them are missing, its going to have an obvious impact on the fertility of a population.In his recently published book, Empty Planet, Bricker proposes the radical idea that contrary to a population explosion apocalypse scenario, the data suggests the world is actually more likely to run out of people.If current models are mistakenly counting women that arent there, that only makes his predictions that much more plausible, he adds.Not that off-kilter sex ratios are some huge secret.For the last 50 years, researchers and journalists have been tracking the phenomenon of plummeting numbers of female births, especially across large swaths of Asia.In Mara Hvistendahls 2011 book, Unnatural Selection, she documented how the rise of ultrasound technology and abortion, starting in the 1970s, empowered women in China and India to choose sons over daughters as part of routine reproductive decision-making in those strongly patriarchal societies.As a result, roughly 50 million excess males under the age of 20 today reside in those two countries.And at least in China, that wave has not yet crested.According to Chaos research, the height of sex-ratio inflation in China peaked in 2005, at about 118 male to 100 female births.That generation of boys is just reaching adulthood now.Its going to be a couple generations before this corrects completely, says Therese Hesketh, a global health researcher at University College London.She studies Chinas Lost Generation of men, mostly rural workers with no marriage prospects, who have resigned themselves to lives spent mostly drinking, smoking, and not having sex.Not being able to start a family is catastrophic in these traditional societies, she notes, and the toll is evident in rising rates of depression in Chinas never-married men.Even after China imposed a ban on sex-selective abortions in 2004 and lifted its one-child policy in 2015, its still not seeing the population rebound that government officials had hoped for, in part because there are just too few women.Heske hopes this will serve as a lesson to other nations.While China and India were responsible for the majority of missing female births, Chaos research shows similar trends in parts of Eastern Europe, like Albania, Armenia, and Montenegro, as well as in the African nation of Tunisia.Theres always been an assumption that sex ratios are only a problem in Asia, but this shows clearly its more widespread, according to Heske.Thats the bad news.The good news is that everywhere, things seem to be trending in the right direction.If you look at South Korea for example, in 1990 boys were being born at the rate of 115 for every 100 girls.Nearly three decades later, after a period of intense social backlash, the ratio has converged back to baseline levels.Other countries with a history of inflated sex ratios are also on trajectories to return to normal, though at a slower pace than the Korean republic.Attitudes have really swung a lot, even in China, says Hesketh.Now its culturally unacceptable to even talk about sex-selective abortions, and having a daughter is seen as a really positive thing.It may take decades for countries like China to get back within the biologically normal range of 102 to 107 male to 100 female births, but demography researchers wont have to wait that long to plug in more accurate estimates.They can start using them today.More Great WIRED

A Shocking Find Shows Just How Far Wind Can Carry Microplastics:::::At the top of the French Pyrenees, not far from the border with Spain, is a virtually pristine clearing, home to snow and a weather stationbut mostly feet upon feet of snow.The nearest road closes in the winter.The most substantial town within 60 miles tallies just 9,000 people.Look closely at the landscape, though, and youll see the place is covered in plastic.Between November 2017 and March 2018, researchers gathered water from the weather stations collectors and searched for microplasticsbits less than a fifth of an inch longand discovered that 365 particles land on every square meter each day.The source?Likely winds blowing from big cities like Barcelona, 100 miles to the south.With the discovery, the researchers have revealed a new horror of plastic pollution.Scientists already knew that microplastics can hang in the air of big cities like Paris and Dongguan, China, but no one has yet shown just how far these things can travel.This work was a short-term pilot study that demands further investigation from other researchers, but the implications are shockingfor supposedly pristine environments the world over, for ecosystems, and for human health.Allen, et a., Nature Geoscience The central problem when it comes to plastic, as weve all heard, is that the stuff takes a thousand or so years to decompose, bouncing around the environment in the meantime.And when something like a plastic bottle decomposes, it sloughs off tiny bits of itself, microplastics that then make their way into organisms.This is a particular problem in the sea, which has been fairly well studied: One survey found that mussels sampled around the UK all had microplastics in them.Less well understood at this point is how different plastic typesthe researchers found a range in their samples, from polystyrene to polyethylene to polypropylenetravel through the atmosphere differently based on their material properties.Also poorly understood is how the shape of a microplastic, whether it be more of a film or fiber or fragment, affects its movement.You might assume a film with more surface area would travel farther than a fragment, but that just hasnt been tested.That's one of the challenges moving forward is trying to actually model how these plastics move in 3D in the air, so we can figure out where they come from, says environmental pollution scientist Deonie Allen of the EcoLab, part of the National Center of Scientific Research for France, coauthor on a new paper in Nature Geoscience.To a certain degree, perhaps it isnt too surprising that the researchers found microplastics here in the Pyrenees, because in their sampling they came across another important clue: a fine orange dust.This probably blew in from the Sahara, a phenomenon this monitoring station has recorded for over a century.(More incredible still, dust from the Sahara also crosses the Atlantic to fertilize the rainforests of South America.)The winds don't make a distinction between the type of the particles, says marine geologist Michlle van der Does, who has studied the long-range transport of dust particles, but who wasnt involved in this new work.These plastic particles are much bigger than the dust particles we find, although we find these giant dust particles as well.But their density is much lower, so they're also more easily transported over great distances.Another consideration is the unique nature of plastic decomposition.As microplastics break apart, theoretically their properties would change.So a single fiber might break into two fibers, creating new pieces with new aerodynamics.As they break down further, microplastics eventually become something even more sinister: the nanoplastic, a piece smaller than a micron, or a millionth of a meter.These vanishingly small bits of plastic can get just about anywhere, including throughout an organisms tissues, as researchers found when they introduced nanoplastics to scallops.What they showed was that within 6 hours these nanoparticles are marching through the animal, says study coauthor Steve Allen, an environmental pollution scientist at the University of Strathclyde and EcoLab (and spouse of Deonie Allen).They're in every part of the animal in 6 hours.Its not just the plastic itself that organisms have to worry about.We do know that these plastics absorb all of the chemicals they pass through in the environment, like pesticides, Steve Allen says.We also know they have heavy metals sticking to them.So if these particles pass into your lungs and carry those chemicals in there, we don't know what's going to happen there yet either.Even more concerning: Nanoplastics look a lot like the nanoparticles used in medicine to deliver drugs in the human body.So they can go through the blood-brain barrier potentially in exactly the same way but carrying their toxins, Deonie Allen says.And this is really worrying.To be clear, though, this idea has not been backed up with data.Researchers have, however, explored another troubling characteristic of plastic in the oceans.In some ecosystems like coral reefs, plastics work as disease vectors, says Luiz Rocha, curator of fishes at the California Academy of Sciences, who wasnt involved in this study.So a piece of plastic is like a little petri dish for all kinds of bacteria, including pathogens.As they go along the reef, they touch one coral and another coral and they transmit the disease.Whether microplastics could act as disease vectors on land is yet another question that demands more research.But its important to keep in mind that the microplastic and nanoplastic problem isnt a land-sea dichotomy.Plastics effect on sea creatures has been much more thoroughly studied than its effects on land creatures like us, but theres also quite a bit of interplay between the two environments.Take laundry, for instance.Washing clothing like yoga pants and fleeces can release hundreds of thousands of synthetic fibers per wash cycle into the environment.They don't get completely removed by the filters, they don't get completely removed by the wastewater treatment plants, says University of Aveiro analytical chemist Joo Pinto da Costa, who has studied plastics in the environment but who wasnt involved in this new research.The fibers end up in rivers and seas, but also in sediments, where they dry out and get picked up by the wind.Also, when you're just putting your clothes up to dry, it's easy to imagine that a lot of fibers will be transported in the wind.This presents us with an astoundingly complex problem.Plastics have made the world an undoubtedly safer and healthier placeimagine what medicine alone would be like without the technology.But the scale with which plastics are contaminating this planet and its lifeforms is growing ever clearer.Even if your country decides to ban all single-use plastic bags, your neighbors might still churn them out and, if this developing model of airborne contamination holds true, the resulting microplastics could blow your way.In that sense its not so different from climate change: Either we all tackle it together, or we risk getting nowhere.It means that it's everybody's problem, Deonie Allen says.But it also means that if you think of the amount of pollution there is in places like China, where they go around wearing masks, that is something we could potentially be facing because we aren't managing our plastic.That's quite scary and it might motivate people to do something.Its worth noting again that this was a small pilot study.But its also worth noting that part of the reason for that was the researchers were so alarmed by the findings, they wanted to get the word out quickly so the

Playground Stunt Sends Folks Flying:::::Why do people do such dumb things?In today's dumb thing, these kids decide to use the wheel of a gasoline-powered scooter to spin up a small merry-go-round at a park.Oh, don't worry, they have helmets on so everything should be fine.NO.Everything is NOT fine.This is why we can't have nice things.Of course, these people aren't the first (or sadly the last) to try this stunt.It rarely ends well.But what makes this such a difficult trick?Why do you want to keep as close to the center as possible?Of course, the answer is all about physics.Forces While Moving in a Circle It starts with acceleration.If you have an accelerating object, you need a net force on that object.This is the basic model for motion.It looks like this.Rhett Allain Yes, the "m" is the mass of the object and the "a" is the acceleration.But what about the arrows over the F and the a?The arrow means that those quantities are vectors.Both acceleration and force have directions as well as magnitude.Pushing with a force of 1 Newton (the unit of force) to the left is different from pushing with 1 N to the right.But if the object is accelerating (also a vector), there must be a force.Then what is the definition of acceleration?Over a short time interval, I can define acceleration as the following: Rhett Allain There will be an acceleration when there is a change in velocity.That means that an object that is speeding up or slowing down would be accelerating.But wait!What about an object that is moving in a circle?That is also acceleration.Since velocity is also a vector, just changing the direction of velocity would also be an acceleration.Rhett Allain The acceleration for an object moving in a circle is pointed towards the center of the circle.Also, the faster you go the greater the magnitude of the acceleration.The larger the radius of the circle, the smaller the acceleration.But you already knew this.You can feel yourself accelerating in a turning car.If you take that sharp turn too quickly, you can really feel it.If we want to talk about the physics of fools spinning around, however, velocity might not be the basic idea to use.If you are on a rotating platform, the magnitude of your velocity depends on how far you are from the center of the merry-go-round.A better quantity to consider is the angular velocity.This is a measure of how fast your angular position changesand it is the same for any position on a rotating platform (but it could still change with time).Using the angular velocity, I get the following expression for the magnitude of acceleration for an object moving in a circle.Rhett Allain The angular velocity is and the distance from the center of rotation is r. But now we have something important.This says that the farther you are from the center of the rotating merry-go-round, the greater the acceleration.Also, the greater the acceleration, the greater the force required to keep you in place.Modeling Rotational Force You know I like to include some type of demonstration to support physics stuff.In this case, I want to show the difference in circular forces for the case where a person is farther from the center of rotation.I have this spinning platform (it's very useful).On the platform I have two masses that are attached with rubber bandsone close to the center and one farther away.For a rubber band, the greater the force the more it stretches.So, the mass that stretches more has a greater force.Here's what that looks like (I have a top-mounted camera that rotates with the platform).Rhett Allain In case it's not clear that the outer mass has a greater stretch, I measured it for you.The inner rubber band is 8 cm long (stretched) and the outer one is 13 cm.Estimation of Actual Forces So, what about this silly merry-go-round?How difficult would it be to hold onto this thing and not fly off?I'll start with some estimations.Let's say the human has a mass of 75 kilograms and starts at a distance of 15 centimeters from the center of the merry-go-round.For the maximum angular velocity, I can just drop this video into Tracker Video Analysis to get a reasonable value of around 7.8 radians per second (74.5 rpm).You might think I could just use this to calculate the acceleration and then calculate the force.Yes, I can and indeed I will do just that.However, there is a problemhumans take up space.That means that this dude is not moving in a circle with a radius of 15 cm.Well, PART of him is doing that but other parts of his body have a smaller radius of motion.So, for calculating the acceleration which radius should I use?It's a complicated question (one that I will answer in the future), but as a rough approximation I will just use the 15 cm.The acceleration of this dude would be 9.1 m/s2 requiring a force of 684 Newtons.This is a significant forceespecially if you compare it to the dude's weight of 735 Newtons.It's like he is hanging from a pole in order to stay close to the center of the circle.But if he falters, just a little bit, bad things will happen.If his radius increases by just 5 cm, the required force jumps up to 912 Newtons.Next thing you know, he is flying off the merry-go-round and he's not so merry.But still, this is a super dumb idea.Even if you know the physics of spinning in a circle, you are going to be better off doing something else.More Great WIRED Stories
Prep for Your Toughest Races Like a Master Marathoner:::::On Wednesday, I spoke with Mebrahtom Keflezighi, perhaps the most successful American marathoner of all time.He won the New York City marathon in 2009 and the Boston Marathon in 2014.He won an Olympic silver medal and was internationally competitive until the age of 42, in a sport where people tend to peak much younger than that.On Monday, he will be the grand marshall of the Boston Marathon.Keflezighi possesses a wealth of running wisdom, much of which he shares in his book 26 Marathons.We spoke mainly about the science of running fast in difficult conditions and about how to keep a career going as one ages.Nicholas Thompson: As someone who ran lots of difficult courses and many marathons, tell me the factors that mattered most to you in a course?Mebrahtom Keflezighi: The first thing is that a marathon is going to hurt no matter what.People need to understand that.But you want to hurt as late as possible, and knowing the course helps.If you know the course is going to be hilly, then you need to do more hills training in your preparation.You should also visualize yourself doing hills.When you come to a hill, what do you need to do?You need to do short strides, more arm action, lean forward a little bit, and conquer it.If you do that for two months or three months, it becomes second nature.NT: What about weather?How much would you focus on the weather forecast in the days before one of your races?MK: I mean, the weathers the weather.I was just talking to Geoffrey Kirui, who won the Boston Marathon two years ago, and he was asking me for some advice: the weather, this and that.And I was like, You know, its going to rain on everybody!What do I need to do to run myself really well in nasty, wet conditions?I dont want to be cold or get hypothermia.So I need to layer up.What material do I need?I need to wear a beanie, or I need to wear a cap, or I need to wear both.So I worry about that versus, Oh man, its going to be bad weather.NT: But when you think about your splits, how much are you adjusting them for the weather?If your plan is to go out at 5 minutes per mile or 4:55, and then you know its a rainy day or a windy day or a hot day, do you and your coach say, OK, let's go out at 5:05?MK: At the elite level, you go with the group.If they go out on 4:50, you have no choice but to go at 4:50.If just one person goes at 4:50, youre like, You know what, I can catch them later.But if six people go, you know theyre going to help each other.So three of them might come back and three of them might survive.So you have to make that conscious decision.You know the coach only can get you ready for the starting line.NT: What were you thinking about the course and weather when you made your big move the year you won, in 2014, one year after the Boston bombing?MK: In preparation, and in my visualization, I thought it was going to come down to the last 500, 600 meters on Boylston Street.But when I made that conscious decision about the course, was when Joseph Boit and myself were running, we separated ourselves from mile 5 to 8 and we wondered, why are they letting us go?Personally, Im thinking, Hey, I won New York; I won a silver medal; youre making a mistake.And then I just said, you know what, I need to control my destiny here.I know the course, and I need to monitor my pace and conquer the hills one hill at a time by myself.I ran 4:31 that 16th mile to get away.And it was risky and painful!And we had ten more miles to go.But you just carry what youre doing it for: you know, youre carrying the [bombing] victims name on your bib, youre carrying the initials on your shoulder.Every step that I made, did I think about dropping out?Absolutely.But then Im like, no I cant do that.And then the crowd amazingly wakes you up and makes you realize how special this is and theyre chanting USA!USA!or Go Meb!Go Meb!doing the wave, and you get emotional, you want to give your energy.I mean you just get a spark of energy and youre like, Im going to do this, Im going to do this.NT: That was one of the greatest races I ever watched.But back to more general strategy for a minute.On a windy day, how much are you thinking about drafting?On a sunny day, how much are you thinking about staying in the shade?MK: When its hot, if you can stay in the shade, absolutely.You think about that instantly, youre thinking about, OK theres shade on the right.And everybody is on the right but the tangents on the left.So you just follow the crowd.On a windy day, its difficult.I try to tuck in as much as I can, but a bunch of the runners are cramped in and the chance of falling is higher.So I try to tuck in and stay back as much as I can.Then I sometimes switch to the side.Peoples legs pop out and theyre not always mechanically up-and-down, up-and-down, front-and-back.I never ran and fell in a marathon but Ive been bumped into many times, so I say, you know what, I just need to be on the side or stay far back and use them as a little windshield.NT: I understand staying far back.You would stay on the west side if the wind is blowing from the east?MK: Right, right.NT: Let me ask you about your career.The last time we talked, you spoke about the ice baths, the nine-day recovery, the training cycle.Now that youre a little ways out from retirement and you look back at the secrets that made you last so long, what else do you say?MK: Oh, I mean the nutrition was important.When you are up to 30 years old, you can eat anything and everything.Your metabolism is still functioning really well, you get away with it.But at 33 or 35 your metabolism slows down.Instead of having no leftovers when you go to a restaurant, you cut it in half and you have half for today and half for tomorrow.But also I think part of my longevity has been running on soft surfaces.I never ran from home, really.I'll just drive to a softer surface with dirt or grass or, you know, especially in San Diego, its only 2.3 miles.You can say, Oh Im going to run 2.3 miles to the park and run 8 miles there and two miles back.And you get your 12-mile run in.But half of it would be on pavement, so to avoid that I always drove there.And when I'm there, I do the drills, I get to do the stretching.When I get home, I get tempted to check my phone, and see a text or a call and get distracted easily.So for me it was finish what I have to do as work when Im at the park, versus go home and get distracted and you shower and then, you know, all of a sudden you forget to stretch.The small details can be big and lead to injury.In San Diego, where I live, its a hilly place.I would have my wife drop me off, or a neighbor.Its only 400 meters, but 400 meters when youre running is short, but when you walk it, it takes forever.NT: Wait, you live up a hill thats 400 meters?And so you would have your neighbors drive you to the bottom of the hill for the start of your run?MK: I have done it a few times, yeah!NT: Thats awesome.MK: I mean, I say, Hey, are you going down the hill?or when we drop my kids off, I say, Hey what are you doing?Let me know when you get ready to go to work and drop me at the hill!Ive done that a few times.But I dont mind running up it at the end because my bodys warm.The impact is more on your body downhill than uphill.NT: That makes sense.Another thing that makes people slow down as they get older, or makes people quit, is that they see themselves getting a little slower from 32 to 33 or a little slower from 31 to 32 and then they say, well thats it, now I'm getting slower, Im done.And that didnt happen with you.You had some moments in your thirties where it looked like you were on the way out, but then two years later youd come back and win a marathon.Tell me about that psychological process.How were you able to keep going even when it looked to the outside world and maybe to you that age had finally caught up with you?MK: I always say that my God-given talent is to max out.For me, I was on this earth to be a runner.But I always think, you know, because of the investment in your body, if you do the small details it will help you for longevity, yes.I ran my PR two weeks before my 39th birthday but I always believed I could run faster.Could I have run 2:06 or 2:05 at one point in my career if everything lined up the way it did in Boston?Absolutely.But, you know, Im not saying, Hey Im a 2:05 guy, let me go get that now.Theres no way.For me it was try to be the best runner that I could ever be at the national level and the world level, and fortunately I have accomplished those.But I still enjoy running.I still love getting out.You know, the hardest part for me right now is putting my shoes on and getting out the door.And I have to do it before 11:00 usually and if I'm traveling, because if I dont do it before that, what I eat, what I drink, has an effect on my performance.But I like to have a tea and a bagel or half a bagel or toast some bread and go.If I can do that, Im happy.NT: And do you still have your neighbors drive you down the hill?MK: Now I dont mind.If my wifes stepping out and I know shes going that way, Ill do that.But Im more casual now.If I get injurednot that I want to get injuredits not like Im getting ready for the Boston Marathon or the New York City Marathon.Still, even if youre not going for the clock time anymore as you get older, you can still enjoy being healthy.NT: What is your advice for everybody whos going to be out there on Monday running into maybe the rain, maybe a headwind, definitely the hills?MK: Oh the hills, we know theyre going to be there, but mother nature has its say with the wind and the rain.Just bundle up.I used to joke around with Deena Kastor and say, dance in the rain: You know what, it is what it is.You know, we cant avoid the puddles or jump around, Im going to hurt myself.Just run through it, run through it.You know, and just have fun.Make the most of it.Its not easy, its difficult.If it was easy, everybody would be doing it.But the Boston Marathon is unique.You have to qualify to get here.So go out there and celebrate your running, celebrate your life, and have fun!I know its torture, but make the most of it.(Note: When you buy something using a retail link in our stories, we may earn a small affiliate

Researchers Want to Link Your Genes and Income—Should They?:::::The UK Biobank is the single largest public genetic repository in the world, with samples of the genetic blueprints of half a million Brits standing by for scientific study.But when David Hill, a statistical geneticist at the University of Edinburgh, went poring through that data, he wasnt looking for a cure for cancer or deeper insights into the biology of aging.Nothing like that.He was trying to figure out why some people make more money than others.Along with a team of European collaborators, Hill sifted through the UK Biobank data to find about 286,000 participants who had answered a survey question about household income.Using that information they conducted something called a Genome Wide Association Study, where they looked at 18 million places in the genome to see which ones matched up with higher paychecks.They uncovered about 30, which account for 7.4 percent of household income variation across the United Kingdom.(For some context, another way of viewing the results is to say that 92.6 percent of a persons income is explained by factors other than genetics.)Hill noticed that many of the genetic differences overlapped with areas known to be associated with intelligence, based on some of his prior work, and when he mapped them out they were largely expressed in the brain.His team then used these regions to compute a polygenic score, a genetic calculation that predicts a persons odds of reaching a certain outcomeof, say, developing diabetes or earning six figures.It didnt perform particularly well, correctly forecasting only 2.5 percent of the differences in income in an independent sample of Scots.Your DNA will not print you money, says Hill.But hes relieved to have found some small effect.If youre born with a predisposition for certain traits or abilities, and none of them counted in any way, shape, or form towards your income, then youd have a profoundly unfair society, in my opinion, he says.Hill and like-minded colleagues are working on a science they call sociogenomics.And bolstered by a global boom in biobanking, they have more data than ever before to probe connections between peoples DNA and their socioeconomic circumstances.A genetic income score could allow economists and epidemiologists to more precisely investigate fundamental questions about inequality.Policymakers might incorporate this information to better evaluate the social programs intended to pull people out of cycles of poverty.In some places, it could be spun as a powerful argument for radical resource redistribution.Megan Molteni covers biotechnology, medicine, and genetic privacy for WIRED.Then there are the dystopian outcomes.Prospective employers could ask you to submit your genetic income score as part of a job application.Health and life insurers could use it to calculate your premiums.Social programs might use it as disqualifying criteria for receiving benefits.Apps like the ones that prevent you from accidentally dating a relative could help you pair up with those genetically inclined toward prosperity.IVF clinics could incorporate it into their genetic screening procedures so parents can choose the highest-earning embryos in addition to the healthiest ones.For every opening to use such information to create a more fair and just society, there exist in equal measure opportunities to weaponize it to exacerbate existing inequalities or perpetuate new ones.Hills unpublished research, posted to the preprint server bioRxiv in mid-March and currently under review, is not yet the stuff of financial fortune-telling.But other, bigger efforts to increase the accuracy of genetic income scores are already underway.Weve been shying away from looking at income for a very long time, for a number of reasons, says Philipp Koellinger, an economist at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, where he studies the genetics of behavior.Looking at the molecular architecture of money-making has a lot of potential to be misinterpreted or abused, he says.Especially by fringe groups who might latch on to sociogenomic research as support for racist notions of a hierarchy of human worth.Despite its new name and new software packages, the emerging field of sociogenomics will forever be entangled with the long, dark, history of the statistical tools that serve as its foundationtools invented by some of the grandfathers of American eugenics.(For more on this, Id suggest Carl Zimmers excellent book on the science of inheritance.)But, says Koellinger, the main reason researchers havent done those studies has been the inadequacy of the data sets.Cheap DNA sequencing and a burst of precision health mega-projects like the UK Biobank, BGIs Million Chinese Genomes project, and All of Us in the US are changing that.Those ethical problems are still large and looming out there, says Koellinger, who worries most that companies will commercialize his results into genetic soothsayers, which he describes as very misguided.But were at a point where so much data is available that someone will do it eventually, so we might as well be the ones to do it first with all the experience weve collected over the years.Back in 2011, Koellinger founded the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium, along with Daniel Benjamin and David Cesarini, to convince researchers from around the world to pool their data so theyd have enough to run a Genome-Wide Association Study, or GWAS.The hope was to tease apart genetic effects from environmental ones for particular traits.The first thing the SSGAC looked into was how long people stay in school.Now, Koellinger is tapping the same network to assemble the largest-ever study linking DNA to dollar signs.So far, hes recruited 22 cohorts with more than 800,000 individuals.Some of them include biobanks in Scandinavian countries that also keep public registries of their citizens tax returns.Others are less granular.The UK Biobank, for example, includes only household incomes, and it lumps them into five buckets.To get around that, Koellingers team developed an algorithm that estimates a persons income using his or her occupation, age, sex, and housing type.Using this method, and a bigger sample, Koellinger hopes to eliminate some of the noisiness of the Hill team's analysis, to arrive at a more powerful genetic predictor of income.The project is still in its early phases but could have initial results as soon as later this year.Of course, limitations still abound.The worlds genetic repositories overwhelmingly contain data from people of European descent.So any polygenic scores derived from them are likely to have less utility in nonwhite populations.Still, Koellinger imagines that the genetic income scores theyll generate will be very valuable to economists trying to uncover how DNA influences the trajectories of peoples livesthe degrees they get, the jobs they work, the money they spend (or save).But other researchers warn that results from such methods should be interpreted cautiously.Its tricky, because right now were much better at identifying genetic variations and building polygenic scores than we are at understanding the causal underpinnings, says Graham Coop, an evolutionary biologist at UC Davis.So while you can use them to control for something about genetics, the issue is you dont know exactly what youre controlling for.Unlike other fields of science that involve designing experiments to collect data and test hypotheses, sociogenomics doesnt bother with either.Instead, using data thats been collected elsewhere, behavioral geneticists unleash statistical algorithms to devour it and spit out correlationsnot causationbetween minute variations in the DNA and any trait that might be of interest.And when you have no visibility into whether those correlations implicate innate biology (neurons that fire faster, say) or social stratification (discrimination based on race, sex, religion, etc.), you can make mistakes.Coop knows this from first-hand experience.Earlier this year he and a group of collaborators set out to replicate an interesting finding in his fieldthat DNA is the reason height varies so drastically across Europe, from the warm southern Mediterranean latitudes up to the sub-Arctic Nordic ones.Starting in 2012, a series of papers used polygenic scores to show for the first time natural selection in action for a complex trait like height.But when Coops team looked for the same signal in the UK Biobank (a much bigger sample), the effect disappeared.We thought it was a solid case, wed just tick the box on replication, and instead it came crashing down, says Coop.The lesson was that there are all these subtle biases that can creep in when you calculate polygenic scores, and those biases compound over thousands of calculations.If that can happen with a trait like height, which is about 80 percent heritable and has been studied for well over half a century, who knows what pitfalls await attempts to do the same thing for income?Koellinger is taking these concerns, along with the ethical ones, seriously.He plans to invite his most vocal critics to collaborate with him on the new GWAS project, in the hope that by involving them in communicating the results he can head off any misinformed or malicious interpretations.We have a scientific responsibility to not just let that happen but to actively try to steer the process.he says.But he admits that without some form of regulation, writing FAQs and giving interviews can only go so far.It doesnt take long for companies to turn polygenic scores for behavioral traits into products, like DNA tests for academic achievement or genetic embryo scans for low intelligence.As soon as our results are in the public domain, we have very little control over what people are going to do with it.Hill thinks the answer isnt regulation so much as education, so consumers know enough not to be taken in by polygenic-score-powered products promising dubious individual predictions.But if thats the case, his own FAQ could use a little work.Nowhere does it mention that a genetic income score that explains only 2.5 percent of variation is not remotely accurate at predicting how much money an individual will make.When I asked him about the notable absence, he said, I dont believe theres anyone out there today who honestly thinks a polygenic score is a good predictor on an individual level at this stagebut he admitted that it might be good to say so explicitly.Like other sociogenomics researchers, Hill believes that his work raises the prospect of personalized social policy.In the same way that personalized medicine aims to identify individuals with a predisposition for a disease, and then give them tools to prevent it from ever manifesting, you could do the same thing with social interventions, he says.If you could compute a genetic income score or genetic education score for kids at a young age, you could change their environment before they start struggling.That might sound good at first, but if the goal is a more just society, policymakers are supposed to work without knowledge of things like socioeconomic status, sex, race, personality, talents, and especially genes.The idea being that doing so automatically leads to discrimination.Sure, DNA sequencing might not have been around when the influential political philosopher John Rawls articulated this idea in his veil of ignorance thought experiment, but a persons genetic source code certainly would have qualified as information better left in the dark.As researchers like Hill and Koellinger move forward with mining the worlds DNA deposits, policymakers will soon have to decide on which side of the veil polygenic scores for things like income, education, and intelligence belong.More Great WIRED

Blankets, bed-sharing common in accidental baby suffocations:::::Accidental suffocation is a leading cause of injury deaths in U.S. infants and common scenarios involve blankets, bed-sharing with parents and other unsafe sleep practices, an analysis of government data found.These deaths "are entirely preventable.That's the most important point," said Dr. Fern Hauck, a co-author and University of Virginia expert in infant deaths.CALIFORNIA BABY DIES FROM WHOOPING COUGH, HEALTH OFFICIALS CONFIRM Among 250 suffocation deaths, roughly 70 percent involved blankets, pillows or other soft bedding that blocked infants' airways.Half of these soft bedding-related deaths occurred in an adult bed where most babies were sleeping on their stomachs.Almost 20 percent suffocated when someone in the bed accidentally moved against or on top of them, and about 12 percent died when their faces were wedged against a wall or mattress.The authors studied 2011-2014 data from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention registry of deaths in 10 states.The results offer a more detailed look at death circumstances than previous studies using vital records, said lead author Alexa Erck Lambert, a CDC researcher.The authors said anecdotal reports suggest there's been little change in unsafe sleep practices in more recent years."It is very, very distressing that in the U.S. we're just seeing this resistance, or persistence of these high numbers," Hauck said.The study was published Monday in Pediatrics.GIRL, 11, DIES AFTER SEVERE REACTION TO TOOTHPASTE, FAMILY SAYS For years, the U.S. government and the American Academy of Pediatrics have waged safe-sleep campaigns aimed at preventing accidental infant suffocations and strangulations and sudden infant death syndrome.These include "back to sleep" advice promoting having babies sleep on their backs, which experts believe contributed to a decline in SIDS deaths over nearly 30 years.But bed-sharing has increased, along with bed-related accidental suffocations from 6 deaths per 100,000 infants in 1999 to 23 per 100,000 in 2015, the researchers note.Dr. Rachel Moon, a University of Virginia pediatrics professor not involved in the study, said the results are not surprising."Every day I talk to parents who have lost babies.They thought they were doing the right thing, and it seems safe and it seems OK, until you lose a baby," Moon said.Some studies have found bed-sharing increases breastfeeding and it's common in some families because of cultural traditions.Others simply can't afford a crib.Erika Moulton, a stay-at-home mom in suburban New York, said bed-sharing was the only way her son, Hugo, would sleep as a newborn.Moulton struggled with getting enough sleep herself for months, and while she knew doctors advise against it, bed-sharing seemed like the only option.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Now 14 months old, "he's still in our bed," she said."Trying to transition him out is a little difficult."The pediatricians group recommends that infants sleep on firm mattresses in their own cribs or bassinets but in their parents' room for the first year.A tight-fitting top sheet is the only crib bedding recommended, to avoid suffocation or strangulation.Young babies can't easily move away from bedding or a sleeping parent; all of the study deaths were in infants younger than 8 months old.
Nebraska man’s rapid heartbeat stabilizes after ambulance hits pothole: report:::::Who said potholes are bad?Paramedics near Omaha last Monday were racing to a hospital to save a 59-year-old man whose heart was racing at work, Omaha's WOWT reported.The mans heart reached 200 beats per minute during the seven-mile 20-minute ride in an ambulance, the report said.PARAMEDICS: DAD SAVED TODDLER FROM DINGO ATTACK IN AUSTRALIA The ambulance hit a pothole and the mans heartbeat converted to a normal rhythm, medics later told the hospital.The phenomenon is rare, but does happen, said one doctor.GET THE FOX NEWS APP "One way to treat that is with an electrical shock.Classically, you'll see it on television.The paddles, 'Clear' and a big jolt.Turns out, you can do that with a pothole," said Nebraska Medicines Dr. Andrew Goldsweig.
How an infant's tumor had fully formed teeth inside:::::A 4-month-old baby boy was found with a rare brain tumor, but that wasnt the only unique factor of the situation.Doctors also discovered fully formed teeth inside the tumor during surgery, the New England Journal of Medicine reported.The infant received an MRI scan after routine doctor visits revealed his head growing at an abnormal rate.The MRI showed a brain tumor with what appeared to be the same structures commonly found in the lower jaw, stated the report.HOW A WOMAN IN ARIZONA WOKE UP WITH A BRITISH ACCENT After closer examination, doctors diagnosed the baby with craniopharyngioma, which is a benign tumor.According to Live Science, this type of tumor is often found to have calcium deposits inside.Dr. Narlin Beaty, a neurosurgeon at the University of Maryland Medical Center and one of the reports authors, told Live Science that experts have suspected teeth-forming cells were involved in the tumors formation.However, this unusual case provides further evidence.Although not unheard of, Beaty said finding teeth in any tumor isnt common.This may also be the first known case of teeth in a craniopharyngioma.THE MIRACLE OF A YOUNG BOY WHO SURVIVED INTERNAL DECAPITATION This type of tumor is a slow-growing one thats rarely found in children under age 2, according to the National Cancer Institute.It often occurs close to the pituitary gland located near the center of the brain.Because the gland controls many important hormones, the tumor can interfere with the bodys production of those hormones.It also causes vision problems in some children.A craniopharyngioma is said to have cyst-like qualities due to excess fluid, but its also partially a mass.Although benign, it does require treatment to prevent further damage.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The infant boy now needs thyroid and adrenal hormone replacement therapy due to damage from the tumor.However, in the year following the surgery, the researchers stated the boy was making good developmental progress.
Skipping breakfast, eating late dinners could be deadly for heart attack survivors, study finds:::::Skipping breakfast and eating dinner close to bedtime could be a deadly decision especially for those who have already suffered a heart attack, a study released this week suggests.Those who skip breakfast and eat late dinners have a four to five times higher chance of an [early] death, another heart attack, or angina (chest pain) within 30 days after hospital discharge for heart attack, per the study, which was published Thursday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION RECALL EXPANDED OVER POSSIBLE CANCER-CAUSING INGREDIENT To come to this conclusion, researchers focused on those who had suffered from a particularly serious heart attack known as an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, or STEMI, according to the study.Researchers then asked the 113 participants 73 percent of whom were men with an average age of 60 about their eating habits.Skipping breakfast, as defined by the studys authors, meant the patient had nothing to eat before noon excluding coffee and water at least three times a week.A late dinner was defined as eating a meal within two hours before going to bed at least three times a week."People who work late may be particularly susceptible to having a late supper and then not being hungry in the morning."Marcos Minicucci, study author By the end, the researchers concluded nearly 60 percent of participants skipped breakfast, roughly 50 percent ate late-night dinners and 41 percent adhered to both eating habits."Our research shows that the two eating behaviors are independently linked with poorer outcomes after a heart attack, but having a cluster of bad habits will only make things worse," Marcos Minicucci, of So Paolo State University in Brazil and the study's author, said."People who work late may be particularly susceptible to having a late supper and then not being hungry in the morning, he continued, adding that "one in ten patients with STEMI dies within a year, and nutrition is a relatively inexpensive and easy way to improve prognosis.NEW YORK MAN WITH MEASLES TRAVELING TO MICHIGAN UNKNOWINGLY INFECTS 39 PEOPLE WITH DISEASE Though the study focuses on the adverse effects of skipping breakfast and eating late dinners for STEMI patients, specifically, the former habit is not uncommon, even among those who are healthy.In fact, a 2011 survey from the NPD Group found 31 million Americans skip breakfast each day.Many who participated in the survey said at the time that time constraints, running late and being too busy, among other responses, were reasons they skipped what many medical professionals say is the most important meal of the day.It is said that the best way to live is to breakfast like a king," Minicucci said, noting a good breakfast is usually composed of dairy products (fat-free or low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese), a carbohydrate (whole wheat bread, bagels, cereals), and whole fruits.Ideally, per Minicucci, breakfast should have roughly 15 to 35 percent of a persons total daily calorie intake.
Meat, poultry contaminated by traces of fecal matter, lawsuit against USDA claims:::::The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is being sued by a nonprofit organization of doctors that has claimed the government agency doesnt properly regulate fecal contamination in meat and chicken production.The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine filed the suit on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., USA Today reported.Although USDA implements a zero tolerance policy for fecal contamination, this policy applies to visible fecal contamination only, the lawsuit claims.The result is that fecally contaminated meat and chicken products pass inspection as long as the feces on them are not visible to the naked eye.MCDONALDS INVESTIGATED AFTER MULTIPLE CLAIMS OF WORMS IN SOFT DRINK CUPS: WERE ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED The Physicians Committee, which has 12,000 members with a mission of saving and improving human and animal lives through plant-based diets and ethical and effective scientific research, petitioned the USDA back in 2013 about the agencys fecal contamination regulations.The organization argued in its 2013 petition that the USDAs fecal contamination regulations arent sufficient.It also proposed the agency should label inspected meat and poultry with the warning: May contain feces.The petition came after the organization did a study in 2011 that allegedly found fecal matter in 48 percent of the poultry products they analyzed from 10 U.S. cities, according to USA Today.SOME CHEWY CHIPS AHOY 13-OZ.COOKIE PACKAGES RECALLED: OFFICIALS The current lawsuit is asking for a substantive response to the petition and alleges that the situation has gotten worse since the 2011 study, the outlet reports.However, USDA said it disagrees with the underlying assumption that meat and poultry products bearing the mark of inspection are likely to be contaminated with feces, The Washington Post reported.Officials with the government agency told the outlet that pathogen testing also occurs to avoid fecal contamination that isnt visible to the human eye.The agency also said other pathogens can be killed by cooking meat properly.According to information from the North American Meat Institute, bacteria on raw products is normal and doesnt automatically mean the product is contaminated by fecal matter.It claims that all bacteria, whether pathogenic or not, are destroyed by cooking.
Nurse diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer after spitting up blood now cancer-free thanks to innovative technology:::::A nurse who went to the doctor for symptoms of fatigue in 2013 said she realized it was probably something more than vitamin D deficiency when she started coughing up blood.But Karie Fisher, of Colorado, wasnt expecting to learn that she was facing stage 4 esophageal cancer, an illness which accounts for just 1 percent of all cancers diagnosed in the U.S.I lived in a very rural area at the time, so [esophageal cancer] wasnt on anybodys radar, Fisher, who was 43 at the time of her diagnosis, told Fox News.I spit up a little bit of blood at one point and I knew that was not good, so I went to the ER and ended up being life-flighted to Denver.SURGEONS REMOVE MAN'S 61-POUND NECK TUMOR IN MARATHON OPERATION Fisher said she was hospitalized for 10 days in Denver, and on the eighth day, she learned of her diagnosis and that the cancer had spread to her liver.She was reportedly told she was terminal, which is when she found Dr. Toufic Kachaamy at the Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Phoenix.Kachaamy said Fisher wasnt the typical esophageal cancer patient he encounters, as some risk factors include being over aged 50, experiencing prolonged or uncontrollable heartburn, being male, and having a family history of the illness.Fisher did say that she was overweight at the time of her diagnosis, which is one of the risk factors, though not a major one.CARBON MONOXIDE SICKENS NEARLY A DOZEN PEOPLE IN YONKERS Half the people who are diagnosed with esophageal cancer do not have heartburn, Kachaamy told Fox News.So that fact that you dont have heartburn does not mean you are not at risk.Most patients are diagnosed after an endoscopy and biopsy, Kachaamy explained, but added that screening for esophageal cancer remains controversial.He said patients with multiple risk factors and those who have been diagnosed with Barretts esophagus, which is when the lining of the esophagus changes, are ones who are monitored more actively.However, for patients like Fisher, that means that the cancer is not found until it has reached advanced stages.Fisher began treatment with traditional chemotherapy and radiation for several years, but there was no change to her tumor.Kachaamy presented another option, truFreeze, which was spray cryotherapy targeted at the tumor in her throat.After three treatments, Kachaamy said Fishers tumor began responding, and eventually, it was small enough to be surgically removed.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fisher, who has been in remission for five years, said patients dont know enough about options like cryotherapy.Dr. Kachaamy was very cutting-edge for me and worked really hard and he brought in spray cryotherapy for palliative reasons, to help shrink the tumor so I could swallow, so it was about nutrition at that time and quality of life, she said.That was one of the things I think that a lot of people arent aware of they traditionally go chemo and radiation but there are some other treatment options out there that I think [are] important for people to know about.
Carbon monoxide sickens nearly a dozen people in Yonkers:::::Two Yonkers families were nearly wiped out Friday morning when they were poisoned by a carbon monoxide leak, authorities said.A total of 11 people six youths and five adults were taken to area hospitals after a resident came home from an overnight shift around 8:20 a.m. and couldnt wake up members of his family, fire officials said.CANCER-CAUSING CHEMICAL TAINTS WATER AFTER CALIFORNIA BLAZE The CO leak, which spanned across two apartments in a building on Coyle Place, left some of the victims red-faced and vomiting while others couldnt be awakened, Assistant Fire Chief John Bonanno told The Post.He said that if the man hadnt come home and found his family, it couldve got worse.The families couldve passed away.People die from CO poisoning all the time.Bonanno said the CO levels inside the home were over 1,000 parts per million.When levels reach 800 parts per million, depending upon how long people are exposed, it could lead to unconsciousness, brain damage and death.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Its unclear how long the victims were exposed to the CO or how the leak started.Click here to get more from NYPost.com

Blood pressure medication recall expanded over possible cancer-causing ingredient:::::The company behind blood pressure medication tablets has expanded a recall for two products after trace amounts of a possible cancer-causing ingredient was detected in the tablets.Torrent Pharmaceuticals Limited said its Losartan Potassium Tablets USP and Losartan Potassium/hydrochlorothiazide tablets, USP, are affected by the recall.FROZEN TUNA SOLD IN NEW YORK, CONNECTICUT RECALLED AMID SALMONELLA OUTBREAK The ingredient detected was identified as N-Methylnitrosobutyric acid (NMBA), a known animal and potential human carcinogen.The company said the recall only affects products found to have more than the FDA-allowable amount of NMBA.The company issued an initial recall in December, followed by two more in January and March.The fourth recall includes an additional 36 lots of Losartan Potassium Tablets USP and 68 lots of Losartan Potassium/hydrochlorothiazide Tablets, USP.A full list of the impacted products can be found here.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP According to the recall notice posted on the FDA website, the company has not received any reports of adverse reactions related to the recall.The medication is used to treat hypertension, hypertensive patients with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and nephropathy in Type 2 diabetic patients.Patients are advised to avoid sudden stoppage of medication, and to consult their pharmacist or physician.
Cancer-causing chemical taints water after California blaze:::::The drinking water in Paradise, California, where 85 people died last year in the nation's worst wildfire in a century, is contaminated with the cancer-causing chemical benzene, officials said.Officials said they believe the contamination happened after the November firestorm created a toxic combination of gases in burning homes that got sucked into the water pipes as residents and firefighters drew water heavily, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported Thursday.CALIFORNIA BABY DIES FROM WHOOPING COUGH, HEALTH OFFICIALS CONFIRM Officials say that may explain why benzene, which has been linked to anemia and leukemia, has been found in tests at various spots rather than from one source in Paradise, which was largely destroyed.The chemical occurs naturally in fire; is part of crude oil, gasoline and cigarette smoke; and is used to make plastics, synthetic fibers and other products, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.Melted plastic meters and plastic pipes also may have sent benzene into the system, water officials say.Paradise Irrigation District officials say they have taken about 500 water samples around town, and they have found benzene 30 percent of the time."It is jaw-dropping," said Dan Newton of the state Water Resources Control Board."This is such a huge scale.None of us were prepared for this."Those who have assessed the problem say the water district may be able to clean pipes to some homes later this year, but it will take two years and up to $300 million before all hillside residents can safely drink, cook or bathe in the water.About 1,500 of the town's 27,000 residents are living in the few surviving houses.Water officials have warned them not to drink, cook, bathe or brush their teeth with tap water and to only take quick showers with warm water.Those residents are living on bottled water deliver daily and water tank deliveries.Norman Stein, 84, drives 15 minutes each week to the water distribution center, loads his trunk with bottles and stacks them in his garage.He and his wife, Darlene, disagree on the risk posed by their tap water in Paradise.She opened the sink tap to show how clear the water is."I could feel an oily substance before.But it's cleared up now," she said."This is good water.""Only it's got benzene in it," her husband retorted."I won't even brush my teeth in that stuff."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Stein is thinking about buying a purifying system, which some of his friends have done.But water officials have said that they don't know how well in-home filters protect residents if there is benzene in their taps.Water experts said what happened in Paradise has been detected only once before during a deadly fire in Santa Rosa last year.They say California must work to ensure the water is safe in Paradise and learn what could protect drinking water in future wildfires."This is really just the beginning here," said Jackson Webster, a Chico State University professor and environmental engineer specializing in the effects of wildfire on water quality."The fires in Santa Rosa caught people by surprise.Now, it has happened twice.The bells are ringing."
California baby dies from whooping cough, health officials confirm:::::A baby in California has died after contracting whooping cough, officials said, marking the first such death in Orange County in more than a decade.A news release posted on Thursday by the countys health officials did not identify the child, or list the babys age.We are deeply saddened by this loss of life and send our condolences to the family, Dr. Nichole Quick, interim county health officer, said in the news release.NYC MEASLES OUTBREAK: FIRST VACCINATION FINES, 4 MORE SCHOOLS SHUT DOWN The health department counted 171 cases of whooping cough, also known as pertussis, in 2018, including eight cases involving infants under three months.Seven of those children required hospitalization.The illness is a very contagious disease that spreads through coughing or sneezing, but it can take up to three weeks for symptoms to appear.Late-stage symptoms may include rapid coughing followed by a high-pitched whoop sound, vomiting and exhaustion.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The best way to prevent pertussis is to be up-to-date on vaccinations, Quick said.Children should receive five doses of DTaP as part of their routine vaccination schedule starting at two months of age.Pregnant women during each pregnancy, regardless of when their previous pregnancy occurred, are strongly recommended to receive Tdap vaccine during their third trimester.Vaccination during this time stimulates production of maternal antibodies that are passed on to the infant, offering protection to the baby against pertussis during the first few months of life.
Surgeons remove man's 61-pound neck tumor in marathon operation:::::A 68-year-old man in China reportedly underwent life-changing surgery to remove a 61-pound cancerous tumor from his neck and upper back earlier this month.The patient, identified as Mr. Tang, had reportedly had the tumor for over 30 years but couldnt find a doctor willing to operate.MOM SPOTS DAUGHTER'S EYE CANCER AFTER NOTICING ODD GLIMMER IN PHOTO According to AsiaWire, Dr. Yang Jun at Ninth Peoples Hospital of Shanghai agreed to take on his case following a medical emergency related to the tumor last year.The tumor, which measured 33 inches long by 25 inches wide, was allegedly attached to Tangs lungs, spine and major blood vessels.Yang reportedly led the 33-hour marathon surgery on April 1, and said Tang experienced major blood loss due to the complexity of the tumor, but that they stabilized him and were able to remove the entire growth.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Tang was reportedly well enough to begin eating normally five days after surgery, and has since recovered to the point where he can walk on his own.
Tiny knee bone three times more prevalent than 100 years ago: study:::::A small bone behind the knee that scientists previously thought had been selected out by evolution a century ago is now three times more prevalent - and possibly linked to arthritis, according to a new study.Experts at Imperial College London say scientists dont know what the fabella does, but patients with osteoarthritis are twice as likely to have a one, the study published this week in the Journal of Anatomy reported.TEEN'S FOOT ATTACHED BACKWARD TO FORM NEW KNEE AFTER CANCER SURGERY The fabella may help reduce friction within tendons, Dr. Michael Berthaume, a co-author of the study, said, but its unclear because the bone has never been researched.Study researchers looked at 20,000 knees dating back to 1918 and found fabellae prevalence went from 11 percent in 1918 to 39 percent in 2018.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The researchers used CT scans and medical journals for the study.

NYC measles outbreak: First vaccination fines, 4 more schools shut down:::::New York Citys Board of Health is issuing civil summonses for three parents who didnt comply with the mandatory measles vaccination order.They are subject to fines of up to $1,000 apiece.The continuing order for vaccinations applies to children ages 6 months and older with fines for non-compliance.City officials announced an emergency vaccination order for four ZIP codes in Brooklyn last week to stem the measles outbreak.A lawsuit challenging the order mandating measles vaccinations in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was dismissed by a state Supreme Court judge on Thursday.The suit was filed by five anonymous parents who claimed the order was unnecessary and infringed on religious rights, also claiming vaccines are dangerous.New York City, as of Monday, has confirmed 329 cases of measles since the outbreak began in October.HEALTH OFFICIALS WARN AGAINST 'MEASLES PARTIES' AMID OUTBREAK The department reported that 44 additional cases were added since last weeks emergency order.Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said in a statement to Fox News, Because of measles long incubation period, we know this outbreak will get worse before it gets better.However, we can turn the tide by people getting vaccinated, especially before Passover when families and communities will gather.We urge everyone to protect their children and their fellow New Yorkers by getting vaccinated immediately.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The department confirmed four more schools were shut down for failing to cooperate.On Monday, the city closed the pre-school portion of a private Jewish school because the school had failed to turn over vaccination and attendance records.Fox News Bryan Llenas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Genetic test predicts middle-aged obesity risk, study finds:::::Can a genetic test identify newborns at risk of becoming severely obese by middle age?Researchers say they have come up with one, and that it might allow interventions in childhood to avoid that fate.The test examines more than 2 million spots in a person's genetic code, seeking variants that individually nudge a person's obesity risk up by a tiny amount.The researchers drew on previously published data about those variants to create a risk score.DOCTOR'S WARN AGAINST NEW 'SHELL ON' SNAPCHAT CHALLENGE A high score didn't guarantee obesity, nor a low score rule it out.But middle-aged people with scores in the top 10 percent were 25 times as likely to be severely obese as those in the bottom 10 percent, scientists reported in a paper released Thursday by the journal Cell.Those two groups were separated by an average weight difference of about 29 pounds, researchers said.Analysis showed the genetic propensity to obesity began having an effect on weight around age 3.Up to about age 8, "you might be able to make a difference in the kids who are born susceptible to obesity," said one author of the study, Dr. Sekar Kathiresan of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.But it will take further research to see whether intervening would work, Kathiresan said.The results for middle age came from a study of about 288,000 people.Overall, the risk-score research included data from more than 300,000 people at various ages.Severe obesity was defined as a body mass index of 40 or more.GIRL, 7, DIES AFTER SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION TO TOOTHPASTE INGREDIENT, FAMILY SAYS Results show genetic inheritance "plays a large role in how heavy one gets," Kathiresan said.The risk score probably takes about half of a person's genetic propensity into account, he said, and it shows similar accuracy in predicting ordinary obesity, defined as a BMI of 30 or more.Even if one inherits a propensity for obesity, he said, "you still have control over your fate.You're not fated to be obese, but it's very clear those individuals who've inherited susceptibility have to work that much harder to keep the weight off."Among study participants with the highest scores, he noted, 17 percent were of normal weight.Other analyses show that people who remain lean despite an inherited propensity for obesity tend to eat better and have more physical activity than others with a high score who got fat."So you can do something about it," he said.Ruth Loos, a professor of environmental medicine and public health who did not participate in the study, said the risk score explains more of people's genetic tendency than previous studies did.But she doubted it would be useful in a doctor's office.It is "never going to be a good predictor," said Loos, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.Sinai in New York.She noted that in one test of the score's predictive power, only 58 of the 371 subjects scoring in the top 10 percent ended up severely obese.And many other severely obese people didn't score in the top 10 percent, she said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Simply asking about family history of obesity would probably work better, she said.The large role of lifestyle in obesity means a purely gene-based predictor will never be perfect, she said.Kathiresan, a cardiologist, said the risk score is best seen as a risk indicator, like high cholesterol.Most people with high cholesterol don't get heart attacks, he said, but they do run a higher risk than others.Jason Boardman of the University of Colorado Boulder said genetic variants might affect body size indirectly, through an impact on lifestyles or other social and behavioral traits.Other research suggests the effect of genes on size depends on what kind of social and physical environment a person lives in, including such factors as access to unhealthy foods, he said in an email.
New guidelines likely to identify more children with high blood pressure:::::Researchers saythat children can manage their high blood pressure with exercise, better diet and other lifestyle changes.Photo by Airman 1st Class Joshua Smoot/U.S.Air Force April 19 (UPI) -- After a revision of older guidelines, more children have high blood pressure, putting them at higher risk for developing heart disease when they reach adulthood -- though experts say that could help them prevent development of the condition.About 11 percent of kids have high blood pressure compared to only 7 percent using the 2004 guidelines set by the organization, according to new guidelines issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics.Those findings were published in the Bogalusa Heart Study."After reviewing years of information from the Bogalusa Heart Study, we concluded that compared with children with normal blood pressure, those reclassified as having elevated or high blood pressure were more likely to develop adult high blood pressure, thickening of the heart muscle wall and the metabolic syndrome -- all risk factors for heart disease," Lydia Bazzano, a researcher at Tulane University and study senior author, said in news release.In a follow-up, 19 percent of kids considered to have high blood pressure under the new guidelines went on to have thickened heart muscles.RELATED CPAP extends life for obese people with sleep apnea About 1.3 million people between ages 12 and 19 have high blood pressure, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The good news, the researchers say, is that children can manage their high blood pressure with exercise, better diet and other lifestyle changes."For most children with high blood pressure that is not caused by a separate medical condition or a medication, lifestyle changes are the cornerstone of treatment," Bazzano said."It's important to maintain a normal weight, avoid excess salt, get regular physical activity and eat a healthy diet that is high in fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts, whole grains, lean protein and limited in salt, added sugars, saturated -- trans -- fats to reduce blood pressure."
Psychological intervention helps patients prevent gum disease:::::Researchers observed a reduction in dental plaque and bleeding, as well as an increase in dental cleanings among adults with moderate periodontal disease.Photo by Milenafoto/Wikimedia Commons April 19 (UPI) -- Dentists can now use psychological techniques to help patients get cleaner teeth, a new study says.Researchers observed a reduction in dental plaque and bleeding, as well as an increase in dental cleanings among adults with moderate periodontal disease, according to research published in April in Journal of Periodontology."Our study shows that by adopting a simple psychological intervention, aided by the use of an online risk assessment tool, we can significantly improve measurable clinical outcomes and reduce initial signs of gum disease in patient seen routinely general dental practice," Koula Asimakopoulou, a researcher at King's College and study lead author, in a news release.Researchers registered 97 adults with moderate peridontal disease in a program at King's College London, offering them either usual dental treatment, treatment and a report on their disease risk, or treatment, a report and a program to improve their dental health.Over the course of 12 weeks, the researchers report they saw significant improvement on dental plaque and gum inflammation among the two groups receiving psychological interventions, but not the usual treatment group.Periodontal disease, which starts with gingivitis, infect teeth and inflame the gums, alveolar bone and periodontal ligament.More severe forms of periodontitis can completely erode the bone around the teeth."At a time when the best way to improve the periodontal health of the majority of people is being considered, this paper demonstrates how interdisciplinary teams of psychologists and dentists working together can deliver improvements in patients' oral health and periodontal status," Asimakopoulou said."Shaping how health information is presented to our patients appears to influence their subsequent behavior."The Journal of the American Dental Association reported that about 42 percent of over age 30 has periodontitis."Good daily oral care is a core element of achieving and maintaining good oral health, and this may have an impact on other aspects of health as well," Asimakopoulou said.
Flu season stretches to longest in a decade:::::The current flu season has lasted for 21 weeks making it the longest since the 2014 -2015 season.Photo by Senior Airman Benjamin Stratton/U.S.Air Force April 19 (UPI) -- The current flu season has lasted for 21 weeks, making it the longest season recorded in the last decade.Flu activity is starting to slow, the CDC reported on Friday, but the season has now become the longest in years as two strains spread across the country in the last five months.After the first strain of flu has been spreading this season -- the season started around Thanksgiving -- a more potent strain of the virus then took over in February, leading to more illnesses and hospitalizations.The previous longest flu season was the 2014 -2015 season.This week, the flu has caused nearly 18,000 hospitalizations, with a rate of 62.3 per 100,000 people.Between 16.7 million and 19.4 million have made flu-related visits this flu season, according to the CDC.Three pediatric flu-related deaths occurred last week, bringing the total to 91 deaths this season.The CDC estimates that flu-related deaths may reach 55,000 this season.Last season, the CDC estimates that 80,000 people died from flu-related illnesses.The flu can be treated by drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir, both of which are available at CVS.
Marijuana users less likely to be obese, study says:::::Although a recent study found that marijuana users are at lower risk for obesity than non-users, researchers say it should not be considered an option for controlling weight.Photo by 7raysmarketing/Pixabay April 19 (UPI) -- The joke is that smoking marijuana can cause weight gain because users might get the munchies, but new research suggests that pot smokers weigh less.The average 5-foot-7 person who smokes marijuana weighs two pounds less than someone who does not, according to a study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.The researchers caution that cannabis shouldn't be thought of as a weight-loss aid, but they say the data is clear."Over a three-year period, all participants showed a weight increase, but interestingly, those who used marijuana had less of an increase compared to those that never used," Omayma Alshaarawy, assistant professor of family medicine at Michigan State and study lead author, said in a news release."Our study builds on mounting evidence that this opposite effect occurs."Researchers compared body mass index, BMI, for 33,000 people over age 18 collected as part of surveys for the National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related Conditions.The surveys included computer-assisted personal interviews on cannabis use, body weight and height."We found that users, even those who just started, were more likely to be at a normal, healthier weight and stay at that weight," Alshaarawy said."Only 15 percent of persistent users were considered obese compared to 20 percent of non-users."Alshaarawy added that "an average 2-pound difference doesn't seem like much, but we found it in more than 30,000 people with all different kinds of behaviors and still got this result."RELATED Smoking pot during pregnancy may cause psychosis in children later in life A 2011 study also showed that obesity among marijuana users was lower, at 17.2 percent, than among those who didn't smoke, at 22 percent.Still, the researchers warn people not to view marijuana as a weight loss aid.Other studies have linked smoking pot to having a bigger appetite, higher caloric intake and high blood pressure."There's too many health concerns around cannabis that far outweigh the potential positive, yet modest, effect it has on weight gain," Alshaarawy said."People shouldn't consider it as a way to maintain or even lose weight."
NIH-funded studies aim to lower opioid deaths by 40 percent in 3 years:::::The National Institute of Drug Abuse will spend more than $350 million to support local opioid recovery, prevention and treatment in four states around the country.Photo by Cindy Shebley/Flickr April 19 (UPI) -- The National Institute of Drug Abuse will spend more than $350 million to support local opioid recovery, prevention and treatment in four states around the country, according to a Friday news release from the National Institutes of Health.The program, which aims to reduce opioid overdose deaths in the four states by 40 percent over the next three years, is a part of the HEAL Initiative, which is designed to curb opioid use in the United States."The Trump Administration recognizes that the most important work to combat our country's opioid crisis is happening in local communities, where governments, organizations, families and individuals are coming together to expand access to prevention, treatment and recovery services," said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar."The HEALing Communities Study is an exciting, unprecedented effort to support communities in using and expanding our scientific understanding of effective interventions.It is a major new step in local and national efforts that are beginning to turn the tide on this public health crisis," Azar said.RELATED Special bag helps twice as many patients dispose of opioids As a part of the study, Boston Medical Center, Columbia University, University of Kentucky and Ohio State University will all receive grant awards.Those organizations will connect with at least 15 communities to see the effects of combining evidence-based prevention, recovery and treatment throughout behavioral health, primary care and other areas.The researchers will attempt to reduce opioid use disorder in those communities by increasing the availability of naloxone, a drug used to treat opioid overdose.They will also work to boost treatment retention numbers over six months, as well as providing recovery support services in those communities.The researchers will track these efforts throughout the time of the study."The evidence generated through the HEALing Communities Study will help communities nationwide address the opioid crisis at the local level," said Nora D. Volkow, director of NIDA."By testing and evaluating interventions where they are needed the most, we hope to show how researchers, providers and communities can come together and finally bring an end to this devastating public health crisis."
Mumps outbreak at Indiana University reaches 16:::::Sixteen students at Indiana University have contracted the mumps.Photo by whitesession/Pixabay April 18 (UPI) -- Sixteen students at Indiana University have contracted the mumps, according to reports.University spokesperson Chuck Carney confirmed that nine of the cases are connected to a fraternity on campus, according to IndyStar."That helps keep the possibility down if they've been exposed," Carney told IndyStar."We had about 58 percent of the frat that took part of it."The new count more than doubles the seven cases reported last week, according to WXIN Fox 59.University officials say the first two students confirmed with the mumps were roommates who lived off campus.The third student diagnosed with mumps received the measles, mumps and rubella vaccination, which is required for students to attend school.This year, Indiana is one of the 10 most infected states in the country.Anyone who has come in contact with the infected students can get a free vaccine, the university said.RELATED Facebook cracks down on vaccine misinformation People who contract the mumps are contagious from two days before showing symptoms until five days after symptoms start.The mumps was almost non-existent in the United States after the two-dose vaccination program, introduced in 1989, wiped out 99 percent of the country's cases.Then in 2006, the country began seeing outbreaks of mumps every five years.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls three or more cases of mumps an outbreak.RELATED Social media platforms move to stem vaccine misinformation Symptoms of the mumps include swollen glands, headache, loss of appetite, muscle aches and fever, which for most people subside after two weeks.The CDC says keeping good hygiene and getting the MMR vaccine are the best way to protect against the mumps.

New HIV therapy may suppress virus for months:::::Early testing of an experimental antibody showed it could suppress viral load in HIV patients for up to four months.Photo by kropekk_pl/Pixabay April 18 (UPI) -- Researchers are hopeful about a new drug to fight HIV, according to study data released this week.The antibody therapy UB-421 can suppress HIV for up to four months in patients who've stopped antiretroviral therapy, or ART, according to research published Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.The researchers treated one group of study participants with weekly injections of UB-421 over eight weeks and another group with higher doses of the drug every other week over 16 weeks.UB-421 stops HIV from infecting T cells by blocking the virus from binding to protein sites that produce them.This keeps HIV from mutating rapidly and developing resistance to therapy."The UB-421 unilateral drug can effectively control the viral load of HIV-infected patients for 16 weeks," said Chang yi Wang, a researcher at Liansheng Pharmaceutical One, in a news release."This is an unprecedented data for the host cell virus receptor-oriented and not easy to produce drug resistance."The therapy kept HIV suppressed in the study participants throughout the entire trial period.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 1.1 million people in the United States is living with HIV."Treatment of HIV infection has opened up a new therapeutic strategy," Wang said."We are currently working on a series of UB-421 clinical development programs, including long-term ART replacement therapy Phase III clinical trials."
Moderate consumption of red meat increases bowel cancer risk:::::People who eat 76 grams of processed meat a day gives them a 20 percent higher risk of getting bowel cancer compared to those who ate only 21 grams.Photo by gate74/Pixabay April 17 (UPI) -- Eating even a moderate amount of red or processed meat may put people at a higher risk for bowel cancer, a new study says.People who eat 76 grams of processed meat a day gives them a 20 percent higher risk of getting bowel cancer than those who eat only 21 grams, according to findings published Wednesday in the International Journal of Epidemiology."Our results strongly suggest that people who eat red and processed meat four or more times a week have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than those who eat red and processed meat less than twice a week," Tim Key, deputy director at the University of Oxford's cancer epidemiology unit and study co-author, said in a news release.The researchers discovered that for every slice of ham or bacon a person ate each day, and for every slice of roast beef or piece of lamb chop, risk shot up 19 percent.RELATED Swapping red meat for healthy plant proteins may reduce heart disease risk "The World Health Organization classifies processed meat as carcinogenic and red meat as probably carcinogenic -- but most previous research looked at people in the 1990s or earlier, and diets have changed significantly since then, so our study gives a more up-to-date insight that is relevant to mean consumption today," Key said.Colorectal cancer is the second leading killer among all cancers in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."This doesn't necessarily mean cutting out red and processed meat entirely, but you may want to think about simple ways to reduce how much you have and how often," said Julie Sharp, who runs U.K.'s head of health information, in a news release."Although breaking habits we've had for a long time can be hard, it's never too late to make healthy changes to our diet.You could try doing meat-free Mondays, looking for recipes using fresh chicken and fish or swapping meat for pulses like beans and lentils in your usual meals."

Oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy safe for preschoolers:::::About 90 percent of preschool children safely got to the maintenance stage after being treated with oral immunotherapy for peanut allergy.File Photo by HandmadePictures/Shutterstock.April 17 (UPI) -- It turns out there may be a good treatment for kids who suffer from peanut allergies.About 90 percent of preschool children safely got to the maintenance stage of treatment about 22 weeks after being treated with oral immunotherapy, according to a study published Wednesday in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice."Although there have been many clinical trials of peanut oral immunotherapy in older children, and one trial in preschoolers, there has been a lack of real-world data due to safety concerns of offering this treatment to preschoolers outside of a research setting," Lianne Soller, a research at the University of British Columbia and study author, said in a news release."But our findings confirm in a real-world setting that this treatment is not only safe but is well-tolerated in a large group of preschool-aged children."Oral immunotherapy starts off by giving a patient a small amount of the food their allergic to -- in this case, peanuts -- and then steadily increasing the amount of that food until they reach maximum dosage.This works to desensitize the person to the food to the point that it doesn't cause a dangerous, allergic reaction.The researchers treated Canadian children between nine months and 5-years-old who have peanut allergies."We were impressed that among over 40,000 doses of peanut that were administered, only 12 resulted in reactions requiring epinephrine," said Edmond Chan, a researcher at the University of British Columbia and study senior author.During the build-up portion after oral immunotherapy treatment, close to 68 percent of the kids still had at least one allergic reaction.But only 36.3 percent of those reactions were mild, while 31.1 percent were moderate."Many allergists do not believe oral immunotherapy should be offered outside of research settings, and have not routinely offered it as a therapy for peanut allergy in their clinics due to safety concerns," Chan said."We hope our data demonstrate that the treatment is safe in preschoolers, and could be offered to families of preschool children with a peanut allergy who ask for it.There appears to be a big difference in outcomes in preschoolers compared to older children," Chan added.

Study: Half of people on statins don't hit healthy cholesterol levels:::::After two years of treatment with statins, about half the patients in primary care still didn't hit healthy cholesterol levels.File Photo by ragonmages/Shutterstock April 16 (UPI) -- A well-known drug used to fight cholesterol may not be working as well as it should, new research shows.After two years of treatment with statins, about half of patients in primary care still didn't hit healthy cholesterol levels, according to a study published Monday in the journal Heart."Currently, there is no management strategy in clinical practice which takes into account patient variations in [low-density cholesterol] response, and no guidelines for predictive screening before commencement of statin therapy," the researchers wrote.The researchers reviewed data collected between 1990 and 2016 for more than 165,000 patients who weren't treated for heart disease or a stroke.These people had their cholesterol measured at least once a year.The good news for statin users was that every 1 millimole per liter decrease in LDL, or bad cholesterol, was linked to a 6 percent drop in stroke risk.After two years, if a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol, didn't fall by at least 40 percent, their statin treatment was considered ineffective.Overall, people who hit the 40 percent mark had a 14 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease.Through the length of the study, nearly 14 percent of patients were diagnosed with heart disease, according to the researchers.Within that group, about 12,000 people missed the 40 percent mark for LDL reduction.While this study didn't look into why statins weren't effective in lowering cholesterol, one researcher thinks it might be because doctors were afraid to prescribe drugs with a higher dosage."Effective implementation of guidelines among healthcare practitioners and the general population has been a challenge for a long time," Marcio Bittencourt, a researcher at University Hospital Sao Paolo and author of an accompanying editorial, said in a news release."Both physicians and patients should be targets for approaches aiming at improving adherence to guidelines."
Workplace wellness programs largely ineffective, study says:::::While workplace wellness programs led to some healthier behaviors, they didn't lower blood pressure, body mass index and cholesterol.File Photo by everything possible/Shutterstock April 16 (UPI) -- Employees are constantly looking for ways to keep employees healthy, which in turn leads to workers putting in more hours at work.However, one study says those programs might not be delivering the overall desired effect.While workplace wellness programs led to some healthier behaviors, they didn't lower blood pressure, body mass index and cholesterol, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA."Our findings show that health behaviors can respond to a workplace wellness program, but they also temper expectations of realizing large returns on investment in the short term," Zirui Song, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and study author, said in a news release.The researchers conducted an 18-month study and found that the wellness programs had no significant, long-term impact on workplaces.However, employees with with wellness programs had 8.3 percent higher rates of regular exercise and nearly 14 percent better weight management rates than employees with no workplace wellness programs.Many employers institute workplace wellness programs to reduce employee alcohol consumption, eliminate smoking and boost exercise and encourage other health behavior, to ultimately increase employee productivity."In assessing the potential benefits of a workplace wellness program, it's essential to separate out confounding factors.The firms that choose to have a program may have employees who are already more health-conscious than those at firms without a program.And the employees who choose to participate may have different health profiles than those that don't," Katherine Baicker, a researcher at the University of Chicago and study author, said in a news release."Our study lets us isolate the effect of the program itself from those confounding factors."This study showed that researchers should be cautious about how effective wellness programs can be on affecting employee behaviors that lead to better health outcomes."As we grow to understand how best to encourage healthy behavior, it may be that workplace wellness programs will play an important role in improving health and lowering the cost of health care," Song said."For now, however, we should remain cautious about our expectations from such interventions.Rigorous research to measure the effects of such programs can help make sure we're spending society's health and wellness dollars in the most effective way."
Junk food purchases by boys drop by 31 percent after intervention, study says:::::A new marketing intervention has shown to reduce that desire and cut boys daily purchases of unhealthy foods and drinks by 31 percent.File Photo by Radu Bercan/Shutterstock April 16 (UPI) -- The urge for kids to buy junk food is made at a gut level, triggered by elaborate marketing designed by the product's manufacturer, a new study says.A new marketing intervention, however, has shown to reduce that desire and cut boys daily purchases of unhealthy foods and drinks by 31 percent, according to research published Monday in Nature Human Behavior."Food marketing is deliberately designed to create positive emotional associations with junk food, to connect it with feelings of happiness and fun," Christopher J. Bryan, a researcher at University of Chicago and study author, said in news release."One of the most exciting things is that we got kids to have a more negative immediate gut reaction to junk food and junk food marketing, and a more positive immediate gut reaction to healthy foods," Bryan said.RELATED Bad diets greatest threat to global health To counter this effect, the researchers introduced a group of eighth graders in Texas to the techniques emotionally-charged marketing techniques junk food companies used to manipulate kids purchasing decisions.This helped reinforce negative depictions of junk food marketing material and, by association, the products themselves.This intervention, in turn, helped the boys develop a negative gut reaction when looking at junk foods.While the intervention didn't show immediate effects on the junk food purchasing habits of girls, it was clear they responded to junk foods with a negative gut reaction, as well."What we've done is turn that around on the food marketers by exposing manipulation to teenagers, triggering their natural strong aversion to being controlled by adults," Bryan said."If we could make more kids aware of that, it might make a real difference."
Lawsuit: Juul violating federal law by marketing to teens:::::The suit says Juul marketing targets underage "vapers."Photo by Mylesclark96/Wikimedia Commons April 15 (UPI) -- A Florida law firm has filed a class-action lawsuit Monday against e-cigarette maker JUUL and tobacco company Altria Group, saying they're violating federal racketeering laws by targeting teens.The lawsuit, filed on behalf of a 15-year-old in Sarasota County, Fla., says Altria, which owns tobacco giant Phillip Morris USA, recently bought a 35 percent stake in JUUL after the e-cigarette leader promised it wouldn't market its products to young people.Attorneys said their teenage plaintiff is addicted to nicotine contained in Juul pods."JUUL has captured a broad segment of the adolescent and teenage market by applying the same techniques historically used by cigarette makers," attorney Scott Schlesinger of Schlesinger Law Offices in Fort Lauderdale said in a statement."The companies tell regulators they are not marketing to that vulnerable age group while they simultaneously and knowingly created a massive increase in youth nicotine addiction."The firm says 78 percent of middle and high school students have noticed e-cigarette advertising and one in five high school students has used the product.JUUL owns 75 percent of the e-cigarette market, the suit said.Research shows that JUUL e-cigarettes have high levels of nicotine and its pods contain as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.Neither JUUL nor Altria immediately responded to the suit."JUUL Labs share a common goal with the Surgeon General and other federal health regulators -- preventing youth from initiating on nicotine," the company said in December."We have taken dramatic action to contribute to solving this problem, which is why we implemented the JUUL Labs Action Plan to address underage use of JUUL products."Federal lawmakers said last week they will investigate Juul's marketing practices.
Study: Sugar-added labels could prevent 600,000 diabetes cases:::::Researchers report that adding sugar added information to food products could help prevent hundreds of thousands of cases of heart disease and diabetes.Photo by mohamed_hassan/Pixabay April 15 (UPI) -- Offering consumers more information about added sugar in food products could reduce the number of heart disease and diabetes diagnoses by hundreds of thousands, a new study says.Between 2018 and 2037, researchers estimate sugar-added labels could mean more than 354,000 fewer cases of cardiovascular disease and nearly 600,000 fewer incidences of type 2 diabetes, according to research published Monday in the journal Circulation."The added sugar label is an important policy step toward reducing consumption of foods and beverages with high added sugar contents, improving health and lowering healthcare spending," Renata Micha, a researcher at Tufts University and study author, said in a news release."These findings have important implications for individuals, policymakers and the food industry alike.Modest industry reformulation would be a powerful way to maximize potential benefits, highlighting industry's critical role in being park of the solution."To arm consumers with more nutritional information, the Food and Drug Administration in 2016 announced mandatory changes to the Nutrition Facts label seen on the outside of make packaged foods.Those changes required the addition of grams and percent of Daily Value of added sugar content, to help consumers follow the 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.RELATED Many with type 1 diabetes unaware of low blood sugar episodes Over the next 20 years, the researchers predict that sugar-added labeling could save $31 billion in net healthcare and nearly $61.9 billion in societal costs.Some companies have started listing sugar-added content on labels, but the 2018 deadline has been extended to 2021 for small manufacturers and 2022 for large manufacturers.People in the United States consume more than 15 percent of their daily calories from added sugar, according to the study.More than 100 million Americans has prediabetes or diabetes, the seventh biggest killer in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."Informing consumers about what is in their sugary drinks, cakes and sweets will help them decide what they want to eat for their health now and later," said Martin O'Flaherty, a professor in epidemiology at the University of Liverpool and study co-senior author."Full implementation of the label before 2021 could help maximize health and economic gain."
C-section infection risk higher among Medicaid patients, study says:::::Medicaid-insured women have a 1.4-fold increase in infection versus those with private insurance.Photo by Ronald Sumners/Shutterstock.com April 12 (UPI) -- The risk of infection after cesarean delivery, or C-section, is higher for women insured by Medicaid, a new study shows.Medicaid-insured women have a 1.4-fold increase in infection versus those with private insurance, according to research published in April in the journal Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology."The findings force researchers to look beyond the usual suspects behind surgical site infections," said Sarah Yi, a health scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and study lead author, in a news release."More investigation is needed to determine why women with Medicaid health insurance had a much greater burden of surgical site infections after cesarean delivery than insured women."The researchers think the infection risk may result from lack of patient literacy, a patient's living condition, their preparedness after discharge and other economic factors.About one-third of babies are born via C-section in the U.S., according to the study.And 40 percent of those births are by mothers insured by Medicaid.C-section deliveries can be lifesaving for mothers but also come with risks beyond infections.Babies born to C-section are more likely to have transient tachypnea, a breathing disorder that causes fast breathing during the first few days of birth."There is a gap in our understanding of health equity when it comes to healthcare-associated infections," Yi said."Future research is needed to identify, understand and reduce potential disparities in healthcare-associated infections related to socioeconomic status, insurance coverage, race/ethnicity and rural residence."
Flu numbers continue to fall but remain high:::::Outpatient hospital visits related to the flu fell by nearly 3 percent from the previous week.Photo by Mojpe/pixabay https://pixabay.com/en/woman-blow-blowing-nose-hand-chief-698964/ April 12 (UPI) -- The number of flu patients visiting hospitals continues to fall as flu season begins to wind down.Nearly 4,000 cases of flu were reported last week in the Unites States.Outpatient hospital visits related to the flu fell by nearly 3 percent from the previous week.Twenty states and Puerto Rico saw widespread flu activity through the week of April 6, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.During that time, four pediatric deaths occurred, bringing the total to 86 for the 2018-2019 season.So far, the CDC estimates there have been as many as 585,000 flu-related hospitalizations and 54,800 flu deaths, along with 40 million flu cases this season.While the H1N1 strain of the flu dominated most of the season, the H3N2 strain took over in the last four weeks as the most prevalent form of flu.Today, nearly, 78 percent of flu cases are H3 compared to just over 23 percent of H1 cases.Overall, more than 160,000 cases of flu have been diagnosed this season.Oral drugs like oseltamivir and zanamivir can treat 99 percent of flu viruses.
Cutting smoking could save Medicaid $2.6B during a year, study says:::::Researcher say the states would save a median of $25 million each with a 1 percent reduction in smoking.Photo by underworld/Shutterstock April 12 (UPI) -- Researchers say they think cutting smoking in each state by 1 percent in a year would lower the cost to taxpayer-supported Medicaid by $2.6 billion the following year, according to findings published Friday in JAMA Network Open."While 14 percent of all adults in the U.S. smoke cigarettes, 24.5 percent of adult Medicaid recipients smoke," said Stanton Glantz, who runs the tobacco research center at University of a California at San Francisco and study author, in a news release."This suggests that an investment in reducing smoking in this population could be associated with a reduction in Medicaid costs in the short run."A 1 percent drop would have median savings of $25 million for state each year, with California leading at more than $630 million.The researchers looked at state-by-state rates of Medicaid recipients who also smoked.They figured that reducing smoking in that group by 1 percent would lower per-capita health care spending by 0.118 percent.The also said that even if the Medicaid recipients cut down on smoking, that still would bring savings in healthcare costs.In 2017 alone, the United States experienced $577 billion in total Medicaid costs, the study said."Because some health risks linked with smoking, such as cancer, can take years to fully manifest, these savings would be likely to grow with each passing year," Glantz said.
Asthma linked to pollution affects 4M children a year worldwide:::::With more than 13 million cars sold in China last year, motor vehicles and their emissions have emerged as the chief culprit for the air pollution and as a cause for childhood asthma.File photo by Stephen Shaver/UPI | License Photo April 12 (U Between 2010 and 2015, roughly 4 million children globally developed asthma annually from inhaling nitrogen dioxide produced largely by motor vehicle exhaust, a new study says.Within the United States, the cities with the highest rate of childhood asthma are Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Las Vegas and Milwaukee, according to research published in April in The Lancet Planetary Health."Our findings suggest that millions of new cases of pediatric asthma could be prevented in cities around the world by reducing air pollution," said Susan Aneberg, a researcher at George Washington University and study author, in a news release.The study listed estimates of new pediatric asthma incidences in 194 countries and 125 cities throughout the world.Overall, 13 percent of those cases were associated with nitrogen dioxide pollution.The researchers said this is the first study to count the global cases of pediatric asthma connected to nitrogen dioxide.In the 125 cities, the rates of children who developed asthma from nitrogen dioxide intake range from 6 percent in Orlu, Nigeria, to 48 percent in Shanghai, China.Eight of the top 10 cities where nitrogen dioxide was attributable to childhood asthma are in China, ranging from 37 percent to 48 percent.Moscow and Seoul both had 40 percent.More than 6 million children in the United States have asthma, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."Improving access to cleaner forms of transportation, like electrified public transport and active commuting by cycling and walking, would not only bring down nitrogen dioxide levels but would also reduce asthma, enhance physical fitness and cut greenhouse gas emissions," Aneberg said.The researchers said that cities with high levels of nitrogen dioxide levels also had high greenhouse emissions.Following through with existing plans to clean up the environment, they said, could help curb new cases of asthma and other health problems related to air pollution."That finding suggests that the World Health Organization guideline for nitrogen oxide might need to be re-evaluated to make sure it is sufficiently protective of children's health," said Pattanun Achakulwisut, a researcher at George Washington University and study lead author, in news release.
CDC study reveals surge in U.S. autism rate:::::The average rate of autism is 1 in 59 for children in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin.File Photo by Dubova/Shutterstock April 11 (UPI) -- Autism rates have surged at an alarming rate in several states around the country since 2010, a new study says.The average rate of autism is 1 in 59 for children in Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin, according to findings published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."It's very likely that the next time we survey autism among children, the rate will be even higher," Walter Zahorodny, an associate professor of pediatrics at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and study author, said in a news release.The researchers studied health records for 4-year-olds between 2010 and 2014 and 8-year-olds within the same time frame.They found that children with other intellectual disabilities and conditions were likely to be diagnosed with autism before age four.Between 2010 and 2014, New Jersey saw a 43 percent spike in autism cases, the largest of any state measured in the study.In all, about 1 in 35 children in the state has autism compared to a low of 8 per 1,000 children in Missouri."These are true influences exerting an effect, but they are not enough to explain the high rate of autism prevalence," Zahorodny said."There are still undefined environmental risks that contribute to this significant increase, factors that could affect a child in its development in utero or related to birth complications or to the newborn period.We need more research into non-genetic triggers for autism."The researchers don't know why autism rates have gone up throughout the country.However, factors such as parents over age 30 having children, genetic mutations, birth prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy and more than one birth might explain the uptick.On average, the researchers say children are diagnosed with autism in 53 months, a number that hasn't changed in over a decade.They want detection "Children who are evaluated for autism early -- around their second birthday -- often respond better to treatment than those who are diagnosed later," Zahorodny said."However, it appears that only the most seriously affected children are being evaluated at the crucial time, which can delay access to treatment and special services."
Study suggests prostate meds may increase risk for diabetes:::::Men taking 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors had the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increased by a third, according to a new study.Photo by linerpics/Shutterstock April 11 (UPI) -- A common prostate cancer drug has been linked to type 2 diabetes, a new study says.Men taking 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors had the risk of developing type 2 diabetes increase by a third, according to research published Wednesday in the British Medical Journal."We found that commonly prescribed medications for prostate disease can increase risk of type 2 diabetes," Ruth Andrew, a researcher at the University of Edinburgh and study senior author, said in a news release."These findings will be particularly important for health screening in older men who are already typically at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes.We will now continue our studies to better understand the long-term outcomes so we can better identify patients at greater risk."The researchers found that men in Taiwan and the U.K. who used dutasteride or finasteride to treat benign prostatic hyplasia had a roughly 30 percent spike in type 2 diabetes.RELATED Researchers creating registry for cancer among firefighters 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors help men with symptoms of enlarged prostates, such as urinary flow problems, by reducing hormone production.The researchers warn men taking 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors not to stop taking the drug.Instead, men taking these drugs should visit their doctors to see if their prescriptions need to be changed."These findings should not be a major concern for men taking 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors medications.As doctors, we may need to review the way we monitor our patients to make sure we are extra vigilant for early signs of diabetes," said Laurence Stewart, a urologist at Spire Murrayfield Hospital and study author, in a news release."Anyone with concerns should speak to their general practitioner or urologist for advice on alternative treatments."
Dogs sniff out cancer 97 percent of time, study says:::::Three beagles were able to correctly detect lung cancer nearly 97 percent of the time, researchers report.Photo courtesy of BIOSCENTDX April 11 (UPI) -- Researchers may have figured a way to use the keen sense of smell of dogs to detect deadly cancers, a new study says.Three beagles were able to correctly detect lung cancer nearly 97 percent of the time, according to a study presented this week at the 2019 Experimental Biology meeting."Although there is currently no cure for cancer, early detection offers the best hope of survival," Heather Junqueira, lead researcher at BioScentDx and study author, said in a news release."A highly sensitive test for detecting cancer could potentially save thousands of lives and change the way the disease is treated."The researchers trained beagles to tell the difference between normal blood serum and malignant lung cancer tissue.The dogs identified the normal tissue 97.5 percent of the time and identified the cancerous tissue 96.7 percent of the time.The smell receptors of all dogs are 10,000 times more sensitive than in humans.The researchers now hope to use this sense to develop inexpensive, noninvasive ways of cancer detection."This work is very exciting because it paves the way for further research along two paths, both of which could lead to new cancer-detection tools," Junqueira said."One is using canine scent detection as a screening method for cancers, and the other would be to determine the biologic compounds the dogs detect and then design cancer-screening tests based on those compounds."The company plans to use the dog-sniffing technique in a recently launched breast cancer study, it said in the news release.
Medicare hospital fund reserves likely to be exhausted in 2026: U.S. report:::::(Reuters) - Medicares hospital insurance fund will be depleted in 2026, as previously forecast, and Social Security program costs are likely to exceed total income in 2020 for the first time since 1982, according to a government report released on Monday.FILE PHOTO: U.S.Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Seema Verma (C) is joined by Concerned Women for America CEO Penny Nance (L) at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 13, 2017.REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo The report from the board of trustees for Social Security and Medicare also projected that Social Security funds could be depleted by 2035, leading to potential reductions in expected payouts to retirees and other beneficiaries.U.S. healthcare costs are expected to be a hot topic during the 2020 presidential campaign, with uncertainty around possible cost-cutting solutions already weighing on healthcare stocks this year.Senator Bernie Sanders, among a large field of contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, has unveiled a Medicare-for-All plan that would eliminate private insurance and shift all Americans to a public healthcare plan.However, Republicans have denounced the proposal as impractical and too expensive.At a time when some are calling for a complete government takeover of the American health care system, the Medicare Trustees have delivered a dose of reality in reminding us that the programs main trust fund for hospital services can only pay full benefits for seven more years, Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), said.The report said costs associated with the Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund, which covers drug costs in Part B and D in the program for seniors, are likely to grow steadily from 2.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2018 to about 3.7 percent of GDP in 2038, given the aging U.S. population and rising costs.Cost projections for Part D drug spending, which covers prescription medicines obtained at the pharmacy, are lower than in last years report because of slower price growth and a trend of increasing manufacturer rebates, CMS said.Part B primarily involves specialty drugs administered on an in-patient basis.Trustees project that the SMI fund for Part B and Part D will remain adequately financed into the indefinite future because current law provides financing from general revenues and beneficiary premiums each year to meet the next years expected costs.The Trump administration in January proposed a rule that would overhaul the use of rebates in government-run healthcare plans, potentially ending a decades-long system under which drugmakers provide large discounts off the list price of their medicines to benefits managers and insurers rather than to consumers.
U.S. records 71 new measles cases in week as outbreak spreads:::::(Reuters) - The United States recorded 71 new measles cases last week, a 13 percent increase as the country faces its second-worst outbreak of the disease in almost two decades, federal health officials said on Monday.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it had recorded 626 cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease in 22 states as of April 19, the highest rate of infection in five years.The CDC had previously reported 555 cases in 20 states between Jan. 1 and April 11.The current outbreak will likely surpass the 2014 outbreak in number of cases, the CDC said on Monday.Iowa and Tennessee were the two states that joined the CDC list with new measles cases.More than half the cases recorded this year occurred in New York City, primarily in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn.The U.S. outbreak is part of a worldwide rise in the once nearly eradicated disease.The World Health Organization reported last week that global cases had risen nearly four-fold in the first quarter of 2019 to 112,163 compared with the same period last year.A vocal fringe of parents in the United States oppose vaccines believing, contrary to scientific evidence, that ingredients in them can cause autism or other disorders.
Updated pediatric blood pressure guidelines catch more kids at risk for heart disease:::::(Reuters Health) - Pediatric blood pressure guideline changes issued in 2017 increase the number of children diagnosed with high blood pressure, a new study finds.That means more kids will be identified as having a higher risk of developing heart disease in adulthood, researchers point out.After analyzing data on nearly 4,000 adults who had their blood pressure recorded in childhood, researchers concluded that the new guidelines would have done a better job at identifying the kids who would later, as adults, have hypertension, an enlarged heart and metabolic syndrome, according to a report in Hypertension.When you compare the old versus the new guidelines in this population, eight percent of the kids would get up-classified as having hypertension, said study coauthor Dr. Lydia Bazzano, an associate professor and director of the Center for Lifespan Epidemiology Research at the Tulane University School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine.Those kids were more likely to have metabolic syndrome, enlarged hearts and hypertension as adults.The children who would have been added to the ranks of those with hypertension might also be at a higher risk of having heart attacks, but it will be years before that data can be collected since most of the people in those in the study are now in their mid-30s to mid-50s, Bazzano said.Unlike adults for whom there are specific blood pressure thresholds for a diagnosis of hypertension, cutoffs for high blood pressure in children depend on their age, sex and height, Bazzano explained.The old guidelines were drawn up based on data from all children, including those who were overweight and obese, which led to a higher cut-point than the new charts which exclude information on overweight and obese children.Although its only a degree or two difference, eight percent more kids would end up with a diagnosis of hypertension under the new guidelines, Bazzano said.The data for the new report came from the Bogalusa Heart Study, a long-term series of studies that began in 1973.Between 1973 and 2016, there were nine cross-sectional surveys of children between three and 18 years old and 11 surveys of adults who had been previously examined as children.The 3,940 people in the new study were examined as children and were followed for 36 years.When the researchers compared how the old and new guidelines would have played out in this population, they found that the newer ones would have caught a much larger number of children who would eventually develop left ventricular hypertrophy.That condition develops when the left ventricle enlarges because it is fighting against a higher pressure than it should be, Bazzano said.Just as weight lifters muscles get bigger, the heart gets bigger and that makes it more vulnerable to not getting enough oxygen.The changes also identified would have identified more children who would eventually develop metabolic syndrome and hypertension in adulthood.The new study is assessing how good this guideline change was at helping identify the kids who were truly at risk, said Dr. Tammy Brady, an associate professor of pediatrics and medical director of the Pediatric Hypertension Program at Johns Hopkins University.Its fascinating.It showed that when kids were reclassified as hypertensive according to the new guidelines they did in fact seem to have more cardiovascular risk factors.So it does seem to do a better job of identifying those who are at risk of developing long term complications.By having a lower threshold for hypertension in children, the new guidelines may give pediatricians more ammunition when they try to convince parents to get their kids to make lifestyle changes that would result in lower blood pressure, Brady said.Sometimes parents are resistant when the physician says, we need to minimize weight gain, she added.Theyll sometimes respond: He looks fine to me.He looks like me.But with an actual diagnosis of hypertension, an alarm bell can go off, Brady said.And I can say we really, really need to work on this.SOURCE: bit.ly/2viYCyu Hypertension, online April 22, 2019.
Swine fever will hurt Brazil soy exports, lift China meat sales: minister:::::SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian soy exports to China will definitely decline this year as African swine fever in the worlds No.2 economy cuts demand for the animal feed, but potential growth in meat exports would offset this, Brazils agriculture minister said on Monday.FILE PHOTO: Brazilian Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias attends the launching ceremony of a sustainability program by the National Agriculture Confederation (CNA) farmers union in Brasilia, Brazil April 3, 2019.REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo Speaking in a huddle with journalists, Tereza Cristina Dias said a Chinese outbreak of African swine fever, which kills pigs but poses no danger to humans, threatens yet offers opportunities for Brazils agricultural exports.Brazil is the worlds largest soybean exporter, while China is the largest importer.As many as 200 million pigs are estimated to die from the outbreak, hurting demand for feed made from grains and oilseeds such as soybeans and corn.We are going to sell our protein at $2,000 a ton, be it chicken, beef or pork, said Dias after meeting with industry stakeholders at the headquarters of the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein (ABPA).It will certainly reduce our soy exports, but we will add value.Dias will head to China in May on an official visit, with stopovers in Japan, Vietnam and Indonesia.Dias said she will defend Brazilian soy exports with Chinese officials, who are in talks with the United States to end a trade war that began last year.U.S. soybean shipments plummeted last year after China slapped 25 percent tariffs on its exports of the oilseeds.Instead, China sought out Brazilian beans, leading the South American countrys soy exports to soar.No agreement between the worlds two largest economies has been formally closed, but the United States holds large stocks of soybeans and has already sent some lots to China as tensions have eased slightly.A possible resolution in the U.S.-China dispute could complicate matters for Brazil, which has profited from the trade tensions.Brazil has to go there and show: We are here, we have always been good partners, we deliver what we commit, we are trustworthy, Dias said.Brazils soy exports are widely expected to soften this year, due to lower foreign demand, tougher competition with U.S. producers and lower domestic production.Brazilian agricultural statistics group Conab, for example, has estimated total sales of 70 million tonnes, after a record 84 million tonnes last year.
Soft bedding top cause of suffocation death for sleeping babies in U.S.:::::(Reuters Health) - Most sleep-related suffocation deaths among babies less than one year old happen because infants airways got blocked by things like pillows, blankets, couch cushions or adult mattresses, a U.S. study suggests.Unintentional suffocation is the leading cause of injury and death among infants under age one in the U.S., researchers note in Pediatrics.For the study, researchers examined national registry data 1,812 cases of sudden unexpected infant death (SUID) between 2011 and 2014.Overall, 250 cases, or 14 percent, involved suffocation.About 69 percent of these suffocation cases were caused by soft bedding like pillows and blankets or by infants sleeping on adult mattresses or couch cushions, which are may not be as firm as crib mattresses.Among soft bedding deaths, more than half of infants five to 11 months old had their airways obstructed by blankets compared with less than one-third of younger infants, said lead study author Alexa Erck Lambert of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Chamberlee, Georgia.Often, the older infants in the study who were suffocated by blankets got tangled up in them, Lambert said by email.It is likely that these older, more developed infants were mobile enough to become entangled in blankets but were not yet coordinated enough to free themselves, Lambert noted.For babies up to four months old, pillows caused suffocation almost twice as often as for older infants in the study.Younger infants may have lacked the mobility and neck strength necessary to lift their heads to prevent an airway obstruction, especially when placed prone or on their side on a pillow, Lambert said.Almost one in five suffocation deaths in the study happened when sleeping babies got smothered by another person, which might occur when parents sleep with infants on a sofa or in an adult bed.And 12 percent of these cases were due to wedging, when babies get trapped between two objects, such as a mattress and a wall.Younger infants are less likely to get themselves into a wedged position because they are less mobile and cannot roll over on their own, Lambert said.Infants who were suffocated by overlay were youngest and had a higher proportion born preterm than infants who were suffocated by soft bedding or wedging, Lambert added.To prevent SUID, doctors advise parents to put babies to sleep on their backs without blankets or other soft bedding or toys that could pose a suffocation risk.Ideally, babies should be in their own crib or bassinet in a caregivers room.Co-sleeping, with babies in a bassinet next to the mothers side of the bed, can help reduce the risk of SUID, said Dr. Lori Feldman-Winter of the Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, New Jersey.This not only decreases the risk of SUID, it also facilitates breastfeeding, Feldman-Winter, who wasnt involved in the study, said by email.But co-sleeping isnt safe when it involves babies sharing an adult bed.It is bed-sharing that we dont recommend because of the evidence that it may lead to suffocation from mechanisms such as overlay, Feldman-Winter cautioned.If a baby is brought into bed, for example to breastfeed, then there should be no soft bedding, and the mattress should be firm, and away from the wall- to prevent entrapment.One limitation of the study is that it relied on data from death certificates, which lack specifics about the sleep environment and can be inconsistent in how they classify suffocation deaths, the study authors note.Even so, the results offer fresh evidence of the risks babies face at different ages, said Dr. Michael Goodstein, director of newborn services at York Hospital WellSpan Health in Pennsylvania.We have known for a long time that babies need to be in a safe sleep environment, which means no pillows, soft bedding, blankets, bumper pads, head coverings - all things that are associated with an increased risk of SIDS and suffocation deaths, Goodstein, who wasnt involved in the study, said by email.And the most dangerous place for a baby to sleep is on a couch - risks increase up to 70-fold!SOURCE: bit.ly/2vhtr6Q Pediatrics, online April 22, 2019.
Voice analysis software may help diagnose PTSD in veterans:::::(Reuters Health) - Voice analysis software can help detect post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans based on their speech, a study suggests.Doctors have long understood that people with psychiatric disorders may speak differently than individuals who do not have mental health problems, researchers note in Depression and Anxiety.While some previous research points to the potential for distinct speech patterns among people with PTSD, its been unclear whether depression that often accompanies PTSD might explain the unique voice characteristics.In the current study, voice analysis software detected which veterans had PTSD and which ones did not with 89 percent accuracy.Those with the PTSD talked more slowly (slower tongue movement), were more monotonous with fewer bursts of vocalization, were less animated and energetic (lifeless) in their speech, and had longer hesitations and a flatter tone, said lead study author Dr. Charles Marmar, chair of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine in New York City.Our findings suggest that speech-based characteristics can be used to diagnose this disease, and with further refinement and validation, may be employed in the clinic in the near future, Marmar said by email.Marmars team used an artificial intelligence program that learns how to classify individuals based on examples of speech.First, researchers recorded hours-long interviews based on questions often asked by clinicians to diagnose PTSD.Altogether, they interviewed 53 Iraq and Afghanistan veterans with PTSD related to their service as well as 78 veterans without the disease.Then, they fed the recordings into voice analysis software developed by Stanford Research Institute (SRI) International, designers of the Siri App, to yield a total of 40,526 speech-based features captured in short spurts of talk.The software linked patterns of specific voice features with PTSD, including less clear speech and a lifeless, metallic tone, both of which had long been reported anecdotally as helpful in diagnosis.While the study did not explore the disease mechanisms behind PTSD, the theory is that traumatic events change brain circuits that process emotion and muscle tone that affect a persons voice, the study team writes.The study was small, and it wasnt designed to prove whether or how PTSD might directly cause changes in vocal patterns.Its also possible that results might be different for people who experienced trauma unrelated to military service such as sexual assault or a natural disaster.Other warning signs of PTSD may also be easier for family members to spot, said Dr. Ronald Pies of Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.I think more general, observable indicators of trauma are more relevant in such cases, Pies, who wasnt involved in the study, said by email.Noticing that a family member exposed to a recent trauma appears to be unusually irritable, aggressive, hyper-vigilant, or reports nightmares, flashbacks of the trauma, or appears socially withdrawn or depressed ... would warrant a clinical assessment.But it may not be too far in the future that a tool like the one tested in the study could be one way to identify people who need to be evaluated for PTSD, said U.S. Army Capt.Jeffrey Osgood of the Center for Military Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.In a perfect world, I see this technology used as an early warning tool for PTSD, Osgood, who wasnt involved in the study, said by email.Its possible a version of the software tested in the study could be readily available, perhaps as a smartphone app, to analyze a persons speech during and after highly stressful or traumatic experiences and to flag potential problems to patients or clinicians, Osgood said.This could prompt a more thorough screening and early intervention, Osgood said.However, more studies are needed before clinicians can confidently use this tool to help make diagnoses.SOURCE: bit.ly/2vhqhA0 Depression and Anxiety, online April 22, 2019.
Transgender U.S. adults have higher risk of poor health:::::(Reuters Health) - Transgender adults may be more likely to have unhealthy habits and medical issues that negatively impact their quality of life than people whose gender identity matches what it says on their birth certificates, a U.S. study suggests.Researchers examined survey data from 3,075 transgender adults as well as 719,567 adults who are cisgender, meaning their gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth.Compared to cisgender Americans, transgender individuals were more likely to be sedentary, current smokers, and uninsured, researchers report in JAMA Internal Medicine.Transgender people were also 30 percent more likely to report being in fair or poor health over the past month than cisgender adults, as well as 66 percent more likely to report experiencing severe mental distress.The U.S. has made a lot of progress over the last several years toward acceptance and celebration of natural human diversity in gender identity and expression, study author Kellan Baker said by email.But between 2014 and 2017 - the period when the survey was done - attitudes shifted and treatment of transgender often got worse, said Baker, a researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.This study shows that being a transgender person in the U.S. today - being transgender in a society that you know doesnt fully accept you - is hard, Baker added.It affects your health in negative ways, and thats why issues such as nondiscrimination protections for transgender people are public health issues.An estimated 0.55 percent of the people in the survey identified as transgender, which suggests there may be about 1.27 million transgender adults in the U.S. Survey participants were asked if they considered themselves transgender and were given four options to categorize their identities: trans male (people who identify as male but were assigned female at birth); trans female (individuals who identify as female but were assigned male at birth); gender non-conforming; or not transgender.Overall, about 19 percent of transgender respondents were current smokers, compared with roughly 16 percent of cisgender people.About 35 percent of transgender individuals were inactive, compared with nearly 26 percent of cisgender adults.And, almost 80 percent of transgender participants had health insurance, compared with 85 percent of other people in the study.Transgender adults also reported more days in the previous month when they felt physically and mentally unhealthy or felt unable to do all of their usual daily activities.The study wasnt a controlled experiment designed to prove whether or how gender identity might directly impact health.Another limitation is that researchers lacked data on how differences within the transgender population such as gender, race and sexual orientation might influence the results.I think the take-home message for transgender adults here is clear, which is that transgender adults face additional mental and physical health disparities when compared to cisgender individuals, said Xiang Cai, a researcher at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City who wasnt involved in the study.Cai attributes the higher risks for poor health in trans people to multiple levels of transgender-specific stigmas.However, I think it is important to note that adults in the transgender community are capable and resilient, Cai said by email.The study also didnt look at whether transgender individuals had gender-affirming surgery or were able to make their outward appearance match their gender identity, Cai said.Gender-affirmation treatments may be associated with higher levels of quality of life among those who desire them regardless of age, Cai noted.SOURCE: bit.ly/2vdLgUg JAMA Internal Medicine, online April 22, 2019.
Merck's Keytruda wins FDA approval as combination therapy for kidney cancer:::::FILE PHOTO: The Merck logo is seen at a gate to the Merck & Co campus in Linden, New Jersey, U.S., July 12, 2018.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Merck & Co Incs cancer therapy, Keytruda, as part of a combination therapy for previously untreated patients with the most common type of kidney cancer, the company said on Monday.The drug was approved in combination with Pfizer Incs Inlyta to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma.The approval, which comes two months ahead of expectations, allows this combination therapy to get an early launch ahead of other rival products, Cowen analyst Yaron Werber said, after the company received FDA approval on Friday.The Keytruda/Inlyta combination could provide serious competition for Bristol-Myers Squibb Cos immunotherapy combination of Opdivo and Yervoy, currently considered a gold standard for previously untreated advanced kidney cancer patients.Keytrudas sales have surged past Opdivos, and the drug is expected to bring more than $10 billion for Merck this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Mercks Keytruda, which works by increasing the ability of the patients immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells, has been its most important revenue growth driver with its domination of the lucrative lung cancer space.According to results from the study posted in February, about 90 percent of the patients who received the Keytruda/Inlyta combination were alive after 12 months, compared with about 78 percent of patients who were alive after a year when treated with an older Pfizer standalone therapy Sutent.
China finds more cases of African swine fever on Hainan island:::::BEIJING (Reuters) - China has detected new cases of African swine fever in six farms across four locations in Hainan province, the agriculture ministry said on Sunday, adding to two earlier cases of the contagious disease identified in the province on Friday.The disease, which is fatal to pigs but harmless in humans, has spread to every province on the Chinese mainland since its initial detection in August 2018.Authorities previously said they hoped the disease would not spread to Hainan, an island located off Chinas southern coast.Among 517 pigs across the six farms, 146 had died of the disease, according to a notice posted on Sunday by Chinas Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs.The local government has begun control measures including quarantine blockades and culling programs, it said.China is the worlds biggest producer and consumer of pork, and the rapid spread of African swine flu has raised concern of a potential shortage.Pork output fell 5.2 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared with a year earlier, showed official statistics released last week.
China draws up tighter rules on human gene and embryo trials: Xinhua:::::FILE PHOTO: A student at Ayi University, a training program for domestic helpers, practices on a baby doll during a course teaching childcare in Beijing, China December 5, 2018.REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinas top legislature will consider tougher rules on research involving human genes and embryos, the first such move since a Chinese scientist sparked controversy last year by announcing he had made the worlds first gene-edited babies.He Jiankui, associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, attracted condemnation from the global scientific community when he said he had used a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born in November.Chinese authorities launched an investigation into Hes work and said they had halted the kind of research he was undertaking.Under the draft laws sent to Chinas legislature for review on Saturday, medical and human trials would face closer scrutiny and stricter requirements, such as ensuring human subjects are properly briefed, state media outlet Xinhua reported.The rules would also require all future trials to be approved by administrative authorities as well as ethical committees, it said.The report did not specify a timeline for the approval of the regulations, or make specific mention of Hes research.In videos posted online and at the November 2018 conference where He made his controversial presentation, He said he believed his gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.Chinese authorities and institutions, as well as hundreds of international scientists, condemned him and said any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes was against the law and medical ethics of China.
Second death in Novartis gene therapy trials under investigation:::::(Reuters) - Novartis AG, which this week announced positive interim trial results for its experimental gene therapy for spinal muscular atrophy, on Friday said investigation is underway into whether a second trial death could be related to the treatment.The logo of Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG is seen at its headquarters in Basel, Switzerland January 25, 2017.REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann Novartis has filed for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the gene therapy, Zolgensma, and a decision is expected within weeks.The FDA submission was based on findings from a trial of 15 babies treated with Zolgensma.But Novartis has expanded its clinical trial program - presenting on Tuesday at an Orlando, Florida meeting of the Muscular Dystrophy Association interim results for 22 babies with Type 1 SMA, the most serious form of the disease.The data showed that Zolgensma treatment resulted in encouraging progress in motor skills such as the ability to sit up.One patient died from respiratory failure, which was deemed by the investigator and an independent monitor to be unrelated to the gene therapy.SMA, which can lead to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death, is the leading genetic cause of death in infants.Novartis officials also disclosed that in addition to that death, a 6-month-old patient with Type 1 SMA had recently died after undergoing Zolgensma treatment in the companys European trial.Preliminary findings indicate this occurred in the context of a severe respiratory infection followed by neurological complications in a symptomatic SMA Type 1 patient, and was deemed possibly related to treatment by the investigator, Novartis spokesman Eric Althoff said in an emailed statement on Friday.He said an autopsy has been performed and results are pending.Meanwhile, trial investigators and regulatory authorities have been informed.Gene therapies use engineered viruses to carry healthy genetic material into a persons cells to replace faulty or mutated genes that cause a disease or condition.Zolgensma As we learn more, we will provide further updates, Althoff said.Novartis estimates that without treatment, 50 percent of babies with SMA Type 1 will not survive or will need permanent breathing support by the time they are 10.5 months old.The company has said its price for Zolgensma will be determined in negotiations with health plans, but it believes the gene therapy would be cost effective at $4 million to $5 million as a one-time treatment.
Higher state minimum wage tied to lower suicide rates:::::(Reuters Health) - Suicide rates grow more slowly in states that increase their minimum wage, according to a U.S. study that suggests this might be one strategy for curbing deaths by suicide.Although a small proportion of the population works for minimum wage, people living in low-income households have a higher risk of suicide than more affluent people, researchers note in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.Raising the minimum wage has been linked to a number of positive outcomes for low-income Americans including higher odds of graduating high school and lower odds of having unmet medical needs.For the current study, researchers examined data on suicide rates and minimum wages in all 50 U.S. states from 2006 to 2016.Over this period, there were approximately 432,000 deaths by suicide.The minimum wage averaged $8.00 an hour during the study, although it changed at some point over the decade in all 50 states.Every $1.00 increase in a states minimum wage was associated with a 1.9 percent decrease in its annual suicide rate, the researchers calculated.Our study found that when a state increased its minimum wage, the suicide rate increased less than in other states and other times, said lead study author Alex Gertner of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Its possible that increasing the minimum wage improves life satisfaction, increases access to healthcare and decreases mental illness, which all lead to fewer suicide deaths, Gertner said by email.We cant say for sure that the slower growth in suicide rates is caused by increasing minimum wages, but it warrants further study.During the study, 16 states had a minimum wage equal to the federal minimum wage every year.In these states, the average minimum wage increased from $6.42 in 2006 to $8.28 in 2009 and then decreased to $7.40 in 2016.Among the other 34 states, minimum wages were higher than the federal minimum wage for about seven years, on average, during the decade-long study period.While suicide rates rose during the study period, their increase was stunted after minimum wage increases.The effect of higher minimum wages on suicide rates appeared most consistent in the years since 2011, as the U.S. economy rebounded from a period of financial crisis.An annual decrease of 1.9 percent in the suicide rate during the study period would have resulted in roughly 8,000 fewer deaths, researchers estimated.While its possible that increasing prosperity in a state could be what enables it to raise the minimum wage and could explain lower suicide rates, the researchers adjusted their analysis to account for state economic conditions, including employment rates and productivity.Although the study cannot prove whether or how changes in the minimum wage might directly impact suicide rates, it builds on evidence from other studies suggesting that higher wages might indeed mean fewer suicide deaths, said Dr. Martin McKee, a researcher at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who wasnt involved in the work.Previous studies have tied minimum wage increases in the UK to improved mental health in the population, and earlier research has also linked economic crisis to psychological turmoil, McKee noted.This is an important study as it is the first to find that states with higher minimum wages have experienced slower growth in suicides, McKee said by email.This study reminds us that political decisions can make the difference between life and death.SOURCE: bit.ly/2IDx9j4 American Journal of Preventive Medicine, online March 21, 2019.
Sleep myths may hinder good sleep and health:::::(Reuters Health) - Widespread beliefs about sleeping include advice on how much sleep is enough, what quality sleep means and how to achieve it, but when these pronouncements are wrong, they can do more harm than good, researchers argue.The study team gathered the most common sleep myths and asked sleep-science experts to rank them according to how wrong they were, and how bad it might be for a persons health to follow the advice.Sleep plays a vital role in our health and wellbeing, said lead author of the report in Sleep Health, Rebecca Robbins of the New York University School of Medicine in New York City.Although there is growing awareness of sleeps importance, myths - or beliefs that are held despite an evidence base to suggest the beliefs are false - are held among some of our population, she told Reuters Health by email.About one third of adults in the U.S. report sleeping less than the recommended seven hours, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Robbins and 10 sleep experts in the fields of sleep research, circadian science, neuroscience and psychiatry compiled a list of 50 potential myths by using web searches of popular press and scientific literature.The experts then rated each one, and the study team narrowed the list to the top 20 sleep myths, based on how false and how significant for public health each was.The list was further broken down into categories, including myths about sleep duration, sleep timing, sleep behaviors, daytime behaviors affecting sleep, pre-sleep behaviors and brain function during sleep.When it came to sleep duration, the highest-rated myth was that being able to fall sleep anytime, anywhere is a sign of a healthy sleep system.Instead, this is more indicative of a chronically sleep-deprived person, the experts said, and excessive daytime sleepiness may be one of the primary symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea.Other myths in this category were that many adults need only five or fewer hours of sleep and your brain and body can learn to function just as well with less sleep.On the other hand, sleep experts said the belief that one night of sleep deprivation doesnt likely have lasting negative health consequences is true.Regarding sleep timing, the highest-rated myth was that it doesnt matter what time of day you sleep.Instead, research on night-shift workers points to lower sleep quality, as well as a higher risk for depression, diabetes and cancer, the study team notes.When the sleep experts ranked myths around sleep behaviors, they considered the worst ones to be, lying in bed with your eyes closed is almost as good as sleeping and if you have difficulty falling asleep, its best to stay in bed and try to fall back to sleep.Instead, the experts said, cognitive activity when a person is sleeping is distinctly different from being awake with eyes closed.Also, those who cant fall asleep should leave bed, avoid blue light and return to bed when theyre tired.Pre-sleep, the experts agreed that alcohol before bed does not improve sleep.Although folklore may encourage a nightcap, in fact, alcohol can lead to sleep disturbances during the second part of the night when REM sleep is most valuable.Alcohol consumption can also worsen sleep apnea symptoms for those with a history of snoring.The sleep experts also refuted the myth that its better to have a warmer bedroom than a cooler bedroom, and recommended a temperature between 65 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (about 18 to 21 degrees C).They also noted that remembering your dreams isnt necessarily a sign of good sleep, and sleeping with a pet doesnt always improve sleep quality, even if it is comforting.Knowing what is true and what is a myth will help to support choices linked to sleep hygiene and sleep architecture, said Sarah Godsell, a public health researcher with the South Gloucestershire Council in the UK, who has studied sleep beliefs and where they originate.Sleep is important, so who do you listen to and who influences your sleep behaviors?Godsell, who wasnt involved in the current study, said in an email.Do you know about its key functions and its importance for health and wellbeing?SOURCE: bit.ly/2Gw4Cuj Sleep Health, online April 16, 2019.
FDA approves Teva's generic nasal spray to treat opioid overdose:::::FILE PHOTO: The logo of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries is seen during a news conference hold by its CEO, Kare Schultz, to discuss the company's 2019 outlooks in Tel Aviv, Israel February 19, 2019.REUTERS/Amir Cohen (Reuters) - Generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd on Friday received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market its generic nasal spray for opioid overdose, the health regulator said.This is the first approval of a generic naloxone nasal spray for use in a community setting by individuals without medical training, the FDA said in a statement.Almost 400,000 people died from an opioid overdose from 1999 to 2017, the regulator said, citing data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The FDA had tentatively approved Tevas generic naloxone nasal spray in June last year.
Stress disorders tied to increased heart disease risk:::::(Reuters Health) - People who suffer from conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be more likely to develop cardiovascular disease, a Swedish study suggests, and the risk may be greatest in the months right after stress disorders are diagnosed.For the study, researchers examined data on 136,637 people diagnosed with PTSD, acute stress reaction, adjustment disorder or other mental health problems caused by stressful or traumatic events.They also looked at data for 171,314 siblings of these patients who were not exposed to stressful or traumatic events as well as almost 1.4 million other individuals without such exposure.None of the subjects had cardiovascular disease at the start of the study period.During 27 years of follow-up, researchers calculated what proportion of people in each group developed cardiovascular diseases every year.Among those with stress disorders, an average of 10.5 people per 1,000 were diagnosed each year with atherosclerosis, arrhythmias, embolisms, high blood pressure, strokes, heart attacks and other cardiovascular conditions.That compares with an average of 8.4 per 1,000 among their siblings and 6.9 per 1,000 in the wider population without stress disorders.The large majority of humans are at some point in their lives exposed to trauma or stressful life events, with a significant proportion developing severe psychiatric reactions such as PTSD or adjustment disorder, said lead study author Huan Song of the University of Iceland in Reykjavik and the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm.Medical providers should be aware that these vulnerable populations may suffer heightened risks of various cardiovascular diseases, which calls for enhanced clinical awareness/monitoring and, perhaps, early intervention among patients with recently diagnosed stress-related disorders, Song said by email.The risk of severe and acute cardiovascular events, such as cardiac arrest and heart attack, was particularly high in the first six months after diagnosis of a stress disorder, and within the first year for other types of cardiovascular diseases, researchers report in The BMJ.And, there was a stronger link between stress disorders and cases of cardiovascular disease that developed earlier in life, before age 50, than for cases diagnosed later, the study found.The study wasnt designed to prove whether or how stress disorders might directly cause cardiovascular disease.While researchers did account for several factors that can contribute to cardiovascular disease like family background, medical history and underlying psychiatric conditions, its still possible that some unmeasured stress-coping behaviors like smoking and drinking might have also influenced the results, the authors note.Its also unclear how treating stress disorders or underlying psychiatric issues might impact the chances of developing cardiovascular problems.The evidence we have to date doesnt show that treating psychological problems leads to reductions in heart disease, said the author of an accompanying editorial, Simon Bacon of Concordia University in Montreal.However, there are very few of these studies and there are some problems with the studies, so it is still possible that the right kind of treatments might actually reduce PTSD and the chances of developing heart disease, Bacon said by email.But patients should still seek medical attention if they feel like stress is affecting their physical or mental health, Bacon advised.There are some really good treatments for these kinds of disorders and no one should suffer unnecessarily, Bacon said.It is also possible that by treating these disorders, the person might not only improve their mental health but also their physical health.SOURCE: bit.ly/2Zm5b1d and bit.ly/2IunTP4 The BMJ, online April 10, 2019.
Older people feel more youthful when they also feel in control:::::(Reuters Health) - Older adults may feel younger than their age on days when they feel most in control of their lives, a small study suggests.People who believe they can influence the outcomes and events in their daily lives generally do feel a greater sense of control than those who feel more helpless, and previous research has linked a strong sense of control to better wellbeing, researchers note in Journals of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences.Past research hasnt offered a clear picture of how day-to-day variation in peoples sense of control might be tied to shifts in how they perceive their own age and wellbeing, however.For the current study, researchers had 116 older adults, ages 60 to 90, and 107 younger adults, ages 18 to 36, fill out daily surveys for eight consecutive days.Researchers asked participants questions about their daily stresses, physical health, sense of control over their daily lives and how old they felt.Among younger adults, feeling in more control on any given day didnt appear to make them feel more youthful.But they did report feeling younger than their chronological age on days when they had low levels of stress and few or no health complaints.With older adults, the picture was different.They typically felt about two to four years younger on days when they felt more in control than usual.Control beliefs can function as an important resource that supports individuals in pursuing their goals - believing that you can accomplish a task helps you to actually get the job done, said study co-author Jennifer Bellingtier of Friedrich Schiller University Jena in Germany.In a similar manner, control could help to foster independence in the lives of older adults, Bellingtier said by email.I think it is possible that when older adults feel in control of their lives they may not feel as though their daily lives align with negative stereotypes about growing old, thus they may report feeling younger than their chronological age.When older adults feel younger than their age, it is typically associated with better mental, physical and cognitive health, study co-author Shevaun Neupert of North Carolina State University in Raleigh said by email.The study wasnt designed to test how shifts in feelings of control might impact physical or mental health.Beyond its small size, one limitation of the study is that it cannot eliminate the possibility of reverse causality - that seniors might have felt more in control on days when they woke up feeling more youthful.The relationship between feeling younger and healthy aging should be viewed as a two-way street, meaning positive feeling and good health could reinforce each other, said Dr. Guohua Li of the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health in New York City.Older adults who feel in control and youthful are likely to be more physically and mentally active and more socially engaged, which could help them continue to flourish and function on the optimal level, Li, who wasnt involved in the study, said by email.SOURCE: bit.ly/2VQgbBS Journals of Gerontology: Psychological Sciences, online March 15, 2019.
China says African swine fever found on Hainan island:::::BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday that it had confirmed outbreaks of African swine fever in two locations in Hainan province, an island off the countrys southern coast which it had hoped to keep free of the contagious disease.The disease, fatal to pigs but harmless in humans, was found on two small pig farms in Danzhou city and two farms in Wanning city.African swine fever has now been found in every province and region on the mainland, including Hainan island, since it was first detected in August 2018.The new outbreak suggests that the situation is out of control, said Yao Guiling, a livestock analyst with Guantong Futures.The rapid and ongoing spread of the disease has raised concerns about a looming pork shortage in the worlds top producer and consumer of the meat.Pork output fell 5.2 percent from a year earlier in the first three months of this year, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, and it is expected to fall much further in coming months.Hainan island, a popular tourist destination about 450 kilometers south of Chinas Guangdong province, was considered by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs to have a good natural barrier against the disease.In a draft plan to establish zones to control the spread of the disease, the ministry said Hainan would be the first region to set up areas free of African swine fever.
Premium New Zealand honey producer admits adding chemicals: media:::::MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A New Zealand company pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges of adding artificial chemicals to its premium manuka honey, media reported, in a flagship prosecution over a product that is high-value export for the country.New Zealand Food Safety filed the case against Auckland-based Evergreen Life Ltd whose products were pulled from shelves in 2016 by the Ministry for Primary Industries, which said they might contain non-approved substances.Demand for honey, which is believed to have health and cosmetics benefits, has been growing globally, especially for manuka honey, collected from the flowers of plants native to New Zealand and Australia.Different species of the plant grow in other parts of the world but they do not produce the flowers needed for the honey, making manuka more expensive, with a small jar selling for up to a few hundred dollars.Manuka is also considered to have better antibacterial properties than other honey, partly because it naturally contains an omega acid called DHA and an antacid known as MGO.Evergreen had been allegedly adding synthetic chemicals to increase the levels of the anti-bacterial agents, allowing the company to sell the honey at a higher price, according to the public-service Radio New Zealand.Neither Evergreen nor the Ministry for Primary Industries answered requests for comment.New Zealand ranks 14th in the world for volume of honey exported and second in terms of value, according to data from New Zealands Trade and Enterprise government agency.In 2017, New Zealand exported nearly $270 million worth of honey, nearly double what it was in 2013.Manuka honey is considered behind most of the exports.Sentencing in the Evergreen case is scheduled for later this month.
Judge upholds New York City's mandatory measles vaccination order:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Brooklyn judge on Thursday ruled against a group of parents who challenged New York Citys recently imposed mandatory measles vaccination order, rejecting their arguments that the citys public health authority exceeded its authority.FILE PHOTO: Materials are seen left at demonstration by people opposed to childhood vaccination after officials in Rockland County, a New York City suburb, banned children not vaccinated against measles from public spaces, in West Nyack, New York, U.S. March 28, 2019.REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo In a six-page decision rendered hours after a hearing on the matter, Judge Lawrence Knipel denied the parents petition seeking to lift the vaccination order, imposed last week to stem the worst measles outbreak to hit the city since 1991.The judge sided with municipal health officials who defended the order as a rare but necessary step to contain a surge in the highly contagious disease that has infected at least 329 people so far, most of them children from Orthodox Jewish communities in the borough of Brooklyn.Another 222 cases have been diagnosed elsewhere in New York state, mostly in a predominantly ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Rockland County, northwest of Manhattan.The New York outbreaks are part of a larger resurgence of measles across the country, with at least 555 cases confirmed in 20 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Health experts say the virus, which can cause severe complications and even death, has spread mostly among school-age children whose parents declined to get them vaccinated.Most profess philosophical or religious reasons or cite concerns - debunked by medical science - that the three-way measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine may cause autism.The judge rejected the parents contention that the vaccination order was excessive or coercive, noting that it does not call for forcibly administering the vaccine to those who refuse it.Under the public health emergency declared last Tuesday by Mayor Bill de Blasio, residents of certain affected Brooklyn neighborhoods who refuse orders to obtain an MMR vaccine face fines unless they can otherwise demonstrate immunity to measles or provide a valid medical exemption.The court challenge was filed in Brooklyns Supreme Court on behalf of five mothers and their children in the affected neighborhoods.Their identities were kept confidential to protect the childrens privacy, their lawyers said.They told Knipel in court on Thursday the city had overstepped its authority and that quarantining the infected would be a preferable approach.Robert Krakow, an attorney for the parents, estimated that just 0.0006 percent of the population of Brooklyn and Queens had measles.Thats not an epidemic, he said.Its not Ebola.Its not smallpox.The health departments lawyers argued that quarantining was ineffective because people carrying the virus can be contagious before symptoms appear.The judge cited 39 cases diagnosed in Michigan that have been traced to an individual traveling from the Williamsburg community at the epicenter of Brooklyns outbreak.The surge in measles there originated with an unvaccinated child who became infected on a visit to Israel, where the highly contagious virus is also running rampant.Krakow later told Reuters he was reviewing the judges dismissal of the case - brought under special proceedings for the appeal of administrative actions - to determine how his clients might respond.The number of measles cases worldwide nearly quadrupled in the first quarter of 2019 to 112,163 compared with the same period last year, the World Health Organization said this week.
Judge rejects challenge of New York City's mandatory measles vaccination order:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Brooklyn judge on Thursday denied a petition seeking to lift New York Citys recently-imposed mandatory measles vaccination order, dismissing a court challenge brought by an anonymous group of parents who argued the order was unconstitutional.The judge sided with municipal health authorities who issued the order last week, calling it a rare but necessary step to contain the worst measles outbreak to hit the city since 1991.The outbreak has infected at least 329 people so far, most of them children from Orthodox Jewish communities in the borough of Brooklyn.
Elon Musk's SpaceX suffers capsule anomaly during Florida tests:::::(Reuters) - Elon Musks SpaceX suffered an anomaly in one of its Crew Dragon capsules while conducting engine tests at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on Saturday, the company said.FILE PHOTO - A SpaceX Falcon 9 carrying the Crew Dragon spacecraft sits on launch pad 39A prior to the uncrewed test flight to the International Space Station from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., March 1, 2019.REUTERS/Mike Blake The initial tests completed successfully but the final test resulted in an anomaly on the test stand, the company said in a statement.The issue was earlier reported by Florida Today, which said orange smoke was seen rising above SpaceXs facilities, and that the anomaly was contained with no injuries.SpaceX said its teams are investigating and are working closely with U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) partners."NASA has been notified about the results of the SpaceX Static Fire Test and the anomaly that occurred during the final test," its administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a tweet here This is why we test.We will learn, make the necessary adjustments and safely move forward with our Commercial Crew Program, he added.NASA has awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co a total of $6.8 billion to build competing rocket and capsule systems to launch astronauts into orbit from American soil.In March, the privately owned SpaceX successfully completed its mission of sending an unmanned capsule to the International Space Station and returned safely to Earth, a mission seen as crucial to NASAs plans to resume human space flight from U.S. soil.SpaceXs first crewed test flight is slated to launch in July with U.S. astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken.
China draws up tighter rules on human gene and embryo trials: Xinhua:::::FILE PHOTO: A student at Ayi University, a training program for domestic helpers, practices on a baby doll during a course teaching childcare in Beijing, China December 5, 2018.REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinas top legislature will consider tougher rules on research involving human genes and embryos, the first such move since a Chinese scientist sparked controversy last year by announcing he had made the worlds first gene-edited babies.He Jiankui, associate professor at Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, attracted condemnation from the global scientific community when he said he had used a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to alter the embryonic genes of twin girls born in November.Chinese authorities launched an investigation into Hes work and said they had halted the kind of research he was undertaking.Under the draft laws sent to Chinas legislature for review on Saturday, medical and human trials would face closer scrutiny and stricter requirements, such as ensuring human subjects are properly briefed, state media outlet Xinhua reported.The rules would also require all future trials to be approved by administrative authorities as well as ethical committees, it said.The report did not specify a timeline for the approval of the regulations, or make specific mention of Hes research.In videos posted online and at the November 2018 conference where He made his controversial presentation, He said he believed his gene editing would help protect the girls from infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.Chinese authorities and institutions, as well as hundreds of international scientists, condemned him and said any application of gene editing on human embryos for reproductive purposes was against the law and medical ethics of China.
Back on Earth, China's Mars simulation base greets first visitors:::::JINCHANG, China (Reuters) - About 100 excited Chinese teenagers completed a five-hour tour of a space colony against a desolate backdrop not unlike the desert planet of Tatooine, the home world of Luke Skywalker.They were not on the set of Star Wars, but at a Chinese-built Mars simulation base in the barren, windswept hills of Gansu province.The facility - comprising several interconnected modules including a greenhouse and a mock decompression chamber - opened its doors to the public on Wednesday.Mars Base 1 Camp, covering an area about one-fifth of an American football field, is the brainchild of a media company and officials in Gansu, a poor province in northwest China.Officials hope the camp, about 40 km (25 miles) from the township of Jinchang, will boost tourism and allow visitors to feel as though they are on the red planet.A plan to invest 2.5 billion yuan ($374 million) will expand the site to 67 sq km (26 square miles) and attract 2 million visitors a year by 2030.I am very excited to be here, said a 13-year-old student from Jinchang.We saw the monolith, a crater and a cave.Its better than the Mars that I had imagined.In the 1968 science fiction film 2001: A Space Odyssey, a mysterious black monolith appears before a tribe of man-apes in the African savannah in one of the most memorable scenes in Western movie history.Chinas space program has fired up imaginations and public appetite for science and science fiction.In January, a Chinese space probe touched down on the far side of the moon for the first time, a feat viewed with pride among ordinary Chinese people.China is developing powerful rockets to help realize a more ambitious dream of sending a probe to Mars in 2020.After that, scientists hope to explore asteroids and even land on one.A nation needs people who look up at the stars, said Bai Fan, CEO of Jinchang Star Universe Culture & Tourism Investment Co, the media company that co-developed the base.Slideshow (18 Images) We hope the bases will let them feel the spirit of space exploration, and not just experience the technology behind it.Apart from being a tourist attraction, the camp has collaborated with the Astronauts Center of China (ACC) to eventually turn the facility into an astronaut-training center.The camp is not the only Mars-themed site in China.On the neighboring Qinghai-Tibet plateau, China unveiled its first Mars village in March.
Out of a drawer and into your nightmares comes a vicious ancient beast:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Ohio University integrative biologist Nancy Stevens peered into a drawer in the wooden cabinets on the top floor of a Nairobi museum in 2010, she saw a chunk of rock containing massive teeth and knew she had come across something important.Simbakubwa kutokaafrika, a gigantic mammalian carnivore that lived 22 million years ago in Africa and was larger than a polar bear, is seen in this artist's illustration released in Athens, Ohio, U.S., on April 18, 2019.Courtesy Mauricio Anton/Handout via REUTERS The overlooked fossils stored at the National Museums of Kenya belonged to one of the largest meat-eating mammals ever to walk the Earth, a beast called Simbakubwa kutokaafrika that stalked Africa 22 million years ago, according to research by Stevens and co-author Matthew Borths published on Thursday.Bigger than any carnivorous land mammal alive today - even a polar bear - Simbakubwas skull was the size of a rhinos, its eight-inch (20-cm) canine teeth as large as bananas.It weighed about a ton and was 8 feet long (2-1/2 meters) snout to rump.According to the research published in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the fossils were excavated around 1980 in western Kenya and never closely examined.Most of the specimens that I study are quite small, so you can imagine my surprise when I opened a drawer that I hadnt examined yet, and saw the enormous teeth glinting up at me.The specimen had been collected decades before, and the team that discovered this fossil was more focused on other parts of the fauna, particularly primates, Stevens said.Simbakubwa was a member of a group called hyaenodonts that appeared 62 million years ago, 4 million years after the extinction of the dinosaurs paved the way for mammalian dominance, and went extinct 9 million years ago.Hyaenodonts preceded carnivore groups like cats, bears, hyenas and wolves, and were closely related to none of them.At first glance, it would have looked like a gigantic hyena or long-tailed wolf with a head that was a little too big for its body.I imagine something like the wargs from Lord of the Rings, said Borths, a Duke Lemur Center paleontologist, referring to fictional monstrous wolves.Simbakubwas name means big lion in Swahili though it was not a cat.It was the largest predator in its ecosystem, a fragmented forest inhabited by early apes, hippo relatives and elephant relatives, and was probably the largest carnivorous land mammal in Africa up to that time.It was not an animal built for long efficient runs across open ground.Instead, its foot was flexed.Carnivores with this posture tend to be ambush hunters like tigers rather than pursuit hunters like wolves, Borths said.
Yale study revives cellular activity in pig brains hours after death:::::(Reuters) - Yale University scientists have succeeded in restoring basic cellular activity in pigs brains hours after their deaths in a finding that may one day lead to advances in treating human stroke and brain injuries, researchers reported on Wednesday.The scientists emphasized that their work did not even come close to reawakening consciousness in the disembodied pig brains.In fact the experiment was specifically designed to avoid such an outcome, however improbable.Still, the study raises a host of bioethical issues, including questions about the very definition of brain death and potential consequences for protocols related to organ donation.The research grew out of efforts to enhance the study of brain development, disorders and evolution.The main practical application is the prospect of allowing scientists to analyze whole brain specimens of large mammals in three dimensions, rather than through studies confined to small tissue samples, Yale said.The study, backed by the National Institutes of Health, offers no immediate clinical breakthrough for humans, according to the authors.Results of the experiment, to be published on Thursday in the journal Nature, run contrary to long-accepted principles of brain death, which hold that vital cellular activity ceases irreversibly seconds or minutes after oxygen and blood flow are cut off.The limited rejuvenation of circulatory function and cellular metabolism in pig brains, which were harvested from animals slaughtered at a meat-packing plant, was achieved four hours after death by infusing the brains with a special chemical solution designed to preserve the tissue.The intact brain of a large mammal retains a previously underappreciated capacity for restoration of circulation and certain molecular and cellular activities multiple hours after circulatory arrest, lead researcher Nenad Sestan said in a Yale press release issued ahead of the study.It was in the lab run by Sestan, a Yale professor of neuroscience, comparative medicine, genetics and psychiatry, that researchers developed the so-called BrainEx system used to pump artificial nutrients into the pig brains vascular network.NOT A LIVING BRAIN Scientists stressed, however, that the treated brains still lacked any detectable signs of organized electrical activity associated with perception, awareness or consciousness.Clinically defined, this is not a living brain, but it is a cellularly active brain, study co-author Zvonimir Vrselja, associate researcher in neuroscience.The BrainEx preservative included substances to block nerve signals.Researchers also were ready to halt any electrical activity that might have emerged through anesthetics and temperature reduction, according to Yale.Slideshow (3 Images) While the study offers no immediate therapeutic benefits for humans, it creates a new research platform that may ultimately help doctors find ways to revive brain function in stroke patients or to test new treatments for restoring brain cells damaged by injury, the authors said.In the meantime, the research could spark new quandaries surrounding the determination of death itself, widely defined by one measure as the irreversible loss of all brain function.The blurring of that line has implications in turn for deciding when doctors are ethically bound to go from preserving a patients life to preserving their organs.For most of human history, death was very simple, Christof Koch, president and chief scientist of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, said in a Nature article accompanying publication of the Yale study.
On Saturn's moon Titan, plentiful lakeside views, but with liquid methane:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists on Monday provided the most comprehensive look to date at one of the solar systems most exotic features: prime lakeside property in the northern polar region of Saturns moon Titan - if you like lakes made of stuff like liquid methane.Ligeia Mare, the second largest known body of liquid on Saturn's moon Titan, shown in data obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft, is pictured in this NASA handout image released January 17, 2018.NASA/Handout via REUTERS Using data obtained by NASAs Cassini spacecraft before that mission ended in 2017 with a deliberate plunge into Saturn, the scientists found that some of frigid Titans lakes of liquid hydrocarbons in this region are surprisingly deep while others may be shallow and seasonal.Titan and Earth are the solar systems two places with standing bodies of liquid on the surface.Titan boasts lakes, rivers and seas of hydrocarbons: compounds of hydrogen and carbon like those that are the main components of petroleum and natural gas.The researchers described landforms akin to mesas towering above the nearby landscape, topped with liquid lakes more than 300 feet (100 meters) deep comprised mainly of methane.The scientists suspect the lakes formed when surrounding bedrock chemically dissolved and collapsed, a process that occurs with a certain type of lake on Earth.The scientists also described phantom lakes that during wintertime appeared to be wide but shallow ponds - perhaps only a few inches (cm) deep - but evaporated or drained into the surface by springtime, a process taking seven years on Titan.The findings represented further evidence about Titans hydrological cycle, with liquid hydrocarbons raining down from clouds, flowing across its surface and evaporating back into the sky.This is comparable to Earths water cycle.Because of Titans complex chemistry and distinctive environments, scientists suspect it potentially could harbor life, in particular in its subsurface ocean of water, but possibly in the surface bodies of liquid hydrocarbons.Titan is a very fascinating object in the solar system, and every time we look carefully at the data we find out something new, California Institute of Technology planetary scientist Marco Mastrogiuseppe said.Titan, with a diameter of 3,200 miles (5,150 km), is the solar systems second largest moon, behind only Jupiters Ganymede.It is bigger than the planet Mercury.Titan is the most Earth-like body in the solar system.It has lakes, canyons, rivers, dune fields of organic sand particles about the same size as silica sand grains on Earth, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory planetary scientist Shannon MacKenzie said.The research was published in the journal Nature Astronomy.
Israel plans new moonshot after maiden mission fails:::::JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The aerospace company behind Israels failed first moonshot said on Saturday it would pursue a second mission with funds raised from private donors and the public.FILE PHOTO: An image taken by Israel spacecraft, Beresheet, upon its landing on the moon, obtained by Reuters from Space IL on April 11, 2019.Courtesy Space IL/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo The robot craft Beresheet, built by non-profit SpaceIL and state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), crashed on its final descent on Thursday, dashing Israels hope of becoming the fourth country to manage a controlled lunar landing.I have had time to think, over the weekend, about what happened, and given all of the encouragement I got, and the support from people all over the world I have come tonight to announce a new project - Beresheet 2, SpaceIL president and high-tech billionaire Morris Kahn told Israels Channel 12 TV.The maiden mission cost about $100 million, most of it raised from private donors like Kahn.He said in the interview that Israeli government participation amounted to about $3 million.Private donors were already pledging funds for the new project, Kahn said, but he added that money should come from the public for a project of the people of Israel.We will not rely on government support, he said.The Beresheet 2 task force would convene on Sunday, he said: We began something that we shall complete, and we will place our flag on the moon.IAI said in a statement it would be happy to be part of further space missions in partnership with SpaceIL under Kahns leadership.So far, only three nations have succeeded in carrying out a controlled landing on the lunar surface - the United States, the Soviet Union and China.Launched from Cape Canaveral on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket two months ago, Beresheet - Hebrew for Genesis or In the beginning - would have been the first craft to land on the moon that was not the product of a government program.(The story is refiled to fix typo in paragraph seven.)
'Seeing the unseeable': Scientists reveal first photo of black hole:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Using a global network of telescopes to see the unseeable, an international scientific team on Wednesday announced a milestone in astrophysics - the first-ever photo of a black hole - in an achievement that validated a pillar of science put forward by Albert Einstein more than a century ago.Black holes are monstrous celestial entities exerting gravitational fields so vicious that no matter or light can escape.The somewhat fuzzy photo of the black hole at the center of Messier 87, or M87, a massive galaxy residing in the center of the relatively nearby Virgo galaxy cluster, shows a glowing ring of red, yellow and white surrounding a dark center.The research was conducted by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project, an international collaboration involving about 200 scientists begun in 2012 to try to directly observe the immediate environment of a black hole.The announcement was made in simultaneous news conferences in Washington, Brussels, Santiago, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo.The image was obtained using data collected in April 2017 from eight radio telescopes in six locations that essentially create a planet-sized observational dish.The teams observations strongly validated the theory of general relativity proposed in 1915 by Einstein, the famed theoretical physicist, to explain the laws of gravity and their relation to other natural forces.We have achieved something presumed to be impossible just a generation ago, said astrophysicist Sheperd Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope at the Center for Astrophysics (CfA), Harvard & Smithsonian.Black holes, phenomenally dense and coming in various sizes, are extraordinarily difficult to observe by their very nature.A black holes event horizon is the point of no return beyond which anything - stars, planets, gas, dust and all forms of electromagnetic radiation - gets swallowed into oblivion.The M87 black hole observed by the scientific team resides about 54 million light-years from Earth and boasts an almost-unimaginable mass of 6.5 billion times that of the sun.A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).This is a huge day in astrophysics, said U.S. National Science Foundation Director France Cordova.Were seeing the unseeable.It did bring tears to my eyes, Cordova added.The first ever photo a black hole, taken using a global network of telescopes, conducted by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project, to gain insight into celestial objects with gravitational fields so strong no matter or light can escape, is shown in this handout photo released April 10, 2019.Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)/National Science Foundation/Handout via REUTERS The existence of black holes was first predicted in 1916.Most galaxies are thought to have a supermassive black hole at their center.RING OF LIGHT The fact that black holes do not allow light to escape makes viewing them difficult.The scientists looked for a ring of light - super-heated disrupted matter and radiation circling at tremendous speed at the edge of the event horizon - around a region of darkness representing the actual black hole.This is known as the black holes shadow or silhouette.The scientists said Einsteins theory correctly predicted that the shape of the shadow would be almost a perfect circle.With M87, it deviated from perfect circularity by less than 10 percent.We found literally the proverbial hole in the middle of this galaxy, and to me that is just stunning, said astrophysicist Dimitrios Psaltis of the University of Arizona, the EHT project scientist.Einsteins theory also was validated by another major astrophysics achievement announced in 2016, the detection of gravitational waves, or ripples in spacetime, arising from two black holes that smashed together.Science fiction has become science fact, University of Arizona astronomy professor Daniel Marrone said.The image has this exquisite beauty in its simplicity, said CfA astrophysicist Michael Johnson, the projects imaging coordinator.It is just a fundamental statement about nature.Its a really moving demonstration of just what humanity is capable of.The project has also targeted another black hole - Sagittarius A* - situated at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy.Scientists expressed optimism about getting a picture of that one, perhaps within a year.Sagittarius A* possesses 4 million times the mass of our sun and is located 26,000 light-years from Earth.Streaming away from M87 at nearly the speed of light is a humongous jet of subatomic particles, though that was not captured in the photo.Slideshow (9 Images) The researchers estimated that the observed shadow of M87 is roughly 2-1/2 times larger than the actual size of the black holes boundary - the event horizon - due to light bending because of the extreme gravitational forces.They think the event horizon measures just under 25 billion miles (40 billion km) across, about three times the size of Plutos orbit around the sun.The projects researchers obtained the data using radio telescopes in the U.S. states of Arizona and Hawaii as well as in Mexico, Chile, Spain and Antarctica.Since then, telescopes in France and Greenland have been added to the global network.
Israeli spacecraft crashes onto moon after technical failures:::::YEHUD, Israel (Reuters) - Israeli spacecraft Beresheet crashed onto the moon on Thursday after a series of technical failures during its final descent, shattering hopes of a historic controlled landing on the lunar surface.The unmanned robotic lander suffered periodic engine and communications failures during the landing sequence, which lasted around 21 minutes, the support team said.Beresheet, whose name is Hebrew for the biblical phrase In the beginning, had traveled through space for seven weeks in a series of expanding orbits around Earth before crossing into the moons gravity last week.The final maneuver on Wednesday brought it into a tight elliptical orbit around the moon, around 15 km (9 miles) from the surface at its closest.From there it was a short, nail-biting and ultimately disappointing conclusion.It seems that a failure in our inertial measurements unit caused a chain of events in the spacecraft avionics which cut off the engines and caused us to lose the mission, said Opher Doron, general manager of the space division at Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI).So far, only three nations have succeeded in carrying out a soft, or controlled, landing on the lunar surface: the United States, the Soviet Union and China.Beresheet would have been the first craft to land on the moon that was not the product of a government program.It was built by state-owned IAI and Israeli non-profit space venture SpaceIL with $100 million funded almost entirely by private donors.Still, the spacecraft achieved some milestones.Slideshow (6 Images) It is by far the smallest, the cheapest spacecraft ever to get to the moon, said Doron.Its been an amazing journey, I hope we get a chance for another one.Shaped like a round table with four carbon-fiber legs, Beresheet stood about 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) tall.It blasted off from Floridas Cape Canaveral on Feb. 21 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and entered Earths orbit about 34 minutes after launch.Its circuitous flight path was around 4 million miles (6.5 million km).A direct route from the Earth to the moon covers roughly 240,000 miles (386,000 km).
Elon Musk's SpaceX sends world's most powerful rocket on first commercial flight:::::(Reuters) - The most powerful operational rocket in the world, SpaceXs Falcon Heavy, launched its first commercial mission on Thursday from Florida in a key demonstration for billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musks space company in the race to grasp lucrative military launch contracts.The 23-story-tall Heavy, which previously launched Musks cherry red Tesla roadster to space in a 2018 debut test flight, blasted off from Floridas Kennedy Space Center carrying its first customer payload.T plus 33 seconds into flight, under the power of 5.1 million pounds of thrust, Falcon Heavy is headed to space, SpaceX launch commentator John Insprucker said on a livestream.Roughly three minutes after clearing the pad, Heavys two side boosters separated from the core rocket for a synchronized landing at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, sparking boisterous cheers from SpaceX engineers in the companys Hawthorne, California headquarters.The middle booster, after pushing the payload into space, returned nearly 10 minutes later for a successful landing on SpaceXs seafaring drone ship 400 miles (645 km) off the Florida coast.In the 2018 test mission, Heavys core booster missed the vessel and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean.The Falcons have landed Musk wrote on Twitter, inaugurating the first successful recovery of all three rocket boosters, which will be refurbished and re-fly in another Falcon Heavy mission this summer to carry a swarm of military and science satellites for the Air Force.Liftoff with Heavys new military-certified Falcon 9 engines was crucial in the race with Boeing-Lockheed venture United Launch Alliance and Jeff Bezos Blue Origin as Musks SpaceX, working to flight-prove its rocket fleet one mission at a time, aims to clinch a third of all U.S. National Security Space missions - coveted military contracts worth billions.The U.S. Air Force tapped SpaceX in 2018 to launch for $130 million a classified military satellite and in February added three more missions in a $297 million contract.Slideshow (8 Images) SpaceX and Boeing Co are vying to send humans to space from U.S. soil for the first time in nearly a decade under NASAs Commercial Crew Program.SpaceXs Crew Dragon capsule, atop a Falcon 9 rocket, cleared its first unmanned test flight in March ahead of its crewed mission planned for July, while the first unmanned test for Boeings Starliner capsule is slated for August on ULAs Atlas 5 rocket.Falcon Heavy carried a communications satellite for Saudi-based telecom firm Arabsat, which will beam internet and television services over Africa, Europe and the Middle East.Privately owned SpaceX, also known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp, was founded in 2002 by Musk, who is also a co-founder of electric car maker Tesla Inc.
Oh, brother! NASA twins study shows how space changes the human body:::::COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (Reuters) - An American astronaut experienced multiple biological changes in space but returned to normal - with some exceptions - after coming back to Earth, according to a study involving twin brothers that shed light on how space flight affects the human body.FILE PHOTO: NASA astronaut Scott Kelly (R), member of the 43 International Space Station crew, and his twin brother Mark pose after a news conference at Baikonur cosmodrome March 26, 2015.REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev In research published on Thursday, scientists compared Scott Kelly to identical twin Mark Kelly after Scott spent 340 days in orbit on the International Space Station and Mark remained Earth-bound.Both are now retired as NASA astronauts, and Mark is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona.Scott Kelly during the flight experienced thickening of the carotid artery and retina, weight loss, shifts in gut microbes, reductions in cognitive abilities, DNA damage, changes in gene expression, and a lengthening of the ends of chromosomes called telomeres, scientists said.After returning home, the telomere elongation was replaced by accelerated shortening and loss, a potentially negative consequence for cellular health, they said.The return was much worse than the adaptation of getting up there, especially for the year flight, Kelly told reporters on Thursday.I felt like I had the flu after the first few days.I was tired for really long time.The study will help scientists better understand the changes astronauts undergo during long-term space travel, crucial knowledge as NASA contemplates human expeditions to the Moon and Mars.Scientists noted changes in the expression of Scott Kellys genes while in space, with most - but not all - returning to normal after six months back on Earth.A small percentage related to the immune system and DNA repair failed to return to normal, however, indicating potential lasting damage at the genetic level.Researchers identified five possible causes for the genetic changes, including space radiation and the weightlessness of a zero-gravity environment.The space station where Scott Kelly lived orbits below the Van Allen radiation belt, a shell of energetic charged particles built up outside Earths protective magnetic field.Radiation is much lower than what we expect it to be going to Mars, said Steven Platts, deputy chief scientist at NASAs Human Research Program.Scott Kellys immune system worked fine in space and a flu vaccine administered in orbit performed just as it would on Earth, the study found.NASA called a strong immune system critical for lengthy space missions to safeguard astronauts from disease-causing microbes in the spacecraft environment.Dr. Andrew Feinberg of Johns Hopkins University, who helped lead the study published in the journal Science, noted that publication of the findings coincides with the 58th anniversary of the first human space flight, by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin.Feinberg called the study the dawn of human genomics in space.Researchers are planning another years-long study to build on Thursdays results.Put me in coach, Im ready to go, Scott Kelly joked.

Virgin Galactic's first test passenger gets commercial astronaut wings:::::(Reuters) - Virgin Galactics first test passenger received her commercial astronaut wings from the U.S. aviation regulator on Tuesday after flying on the companys rocket plane to evaluate the customer experience in February.Virgin Galactics chief astronaut instructor, Beth Moses, who is a former NASA engineer, became the first woman to fly to space on a commercial vehicle when she joined pilots David Mackay and Mike Masucci on SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity.The wings were presented to the three-person crew at the 35th Space Symposium in Colorado by the Federal Aviation Administrations associate administrator for commercial space, Wayne Monteith.Commercial human space flight is now a reality, he said.The February test flight nudged Richard Bransons space travel company closer to delivering suborbital flights for the more than 600 people who have paid Virgin Galactic about $80 million in deposits.Branson has said he hopes to be the first passenger on a commercial flight in 2019.The 90-minute flight, during which passengers will be able to experience a few minutes of weightlessness and see the Earths curvature, costs $250,000 a price that the company said will increase before it falls.Jeff Bezos Blue Origin and Elon Musks SpaceX are also in the space tourism race.Blue Origin has launched its New Shepard rocket to space, but its trips have not yet carried humans.SpaceX last year named Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa as its first passenger on a voyage around the moon, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Moses, who as a NASA engineer worked on the assembly of the International Space Station, is designing a three-day training program for Virgin Galactics future space tourists.I gleaned a lot of firsthand information that we can roll into the design and then also into the training, she said on her return to earth in Mojave, California, in February.Virgin Galactic rocket plane, the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane, with SpaceShipTwo passenger craft takes off from Mojave Air and Space Port in Mojave, California, U.S., February 22, 2019.REUTERS/Gene Blevins The passengers, some of whom have been signed up since 2004, will train in a mock-up cabin at New Mexicos Spaceport America before their flights.Moses told Reuters she aims for customers to arrive in space not wondering what noise they just heard or being surprised by the G they just felt.Virgin Galactics Branson will also receive the annual Space Achievement Award at the symposium in recognition of the companys two crewed test flights, the first from U.S. soil since the final Space Shuttle mission in 2011.
Fossils of enigmatic extinct human species found on Philippine island:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thirteen fossil bones and teeth excavated in a cave in the Philippines represent an enigmatic previously unknown human species, probably small in stature and possessing an unexpected mix of archaic and modern traits, scientists said on Wednesday.Right upper teeth of an individual of the newly identified species Homo luzonensis, found in Callao Cave on Luzon Island, the Philippines, are seen in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters April 10, 2019.Callao Cave Archaeology Project/Handout via REUTERS The discovery of remains of at least three individuals from this species, named Homo luzonensis, in Callao Cave on the northern part of the island of Luzon marked the second time in the 21st century that a bygone member of the human family has been found on southeast Asian islands.The researchers were unable to extract DNA but did determine that one of the individuals lived 67,000 years ago and the other 50,000 years ago.In 2003, fossils of another island-dwelling species - Homo floresiensis, dubbed the Hobbit due to its diminutive size - were unearthed in a cave on the Indonesian island of Flores, some 1,800 miles (3,000 km) from the Luzon site.There is no indication the two species interacted or were closely related.Homo luzonensis was a contemporary not only of the Hobbit but of our own species, Homo sapiens, which emerged in Africa roughly 300,000 years ago.The scientists said they could not rule out the possibility that the arrival of our species in the region contributed to the demise of Homo luzonensis.The Hobbit also disappeared about 50,000 years ago at the same time Homo sapiens was spreading through the region.The Luzon and Flores discoveries demonstrate that the story of human evolution is more complicated than previously understood, with Asia offering up surprises, potentially with more to come, the researchers said.HOW BIG WERE THEY?The researchers were circumspect in describing the physical appearance and lifestyle of Homo luzonensis, known only from a sparse assemblage of hand and foot bones, and teeth from two adults and one juvenile, with no skull fossils.Based on tooth size in particular, it appears it might have been much smaller than Homo sapiens, but it is unclear whether it was as little as the Hobbit, which was roughly 3-1/2 feet (1 meter) tall.We have to stay cautious about it, especially because people will immediately have Homo floresiensis in mind as a model for the physical appearance of Homo luzonensis, which was certainly not the case, said paleoanthropologist Florent Dtroit of the Muse de lHomme-Musum National dHistoire Naturelle in Paris.We can only speculate but it might be only in the range of a pygmy Homo sapiens, added archaeologist Armand Mijares, leader of the Callao Archaeological Project.The research was published in the journal Nature.Based on animal bones with butchering marks found at the site, it appears these people ate meat and may have used stone tools, Dtroit said.The fossils from the seven-chamber cave, situated in the foothills of Luzons northern Sierra Madre mountains, boasted a combination of anatomical features setting it apart from other human species.Slideshow (3 Images) Some characteristics were similar to Homo sapiens as well as the Hobbit.Other traits were so archaic that they resembled Australopithecus, an earlier member of the human evolutionary lineage that died out roughly 2 million years ago, as well as the ancient human species Homo habilis and Homo erectus.For years - and until less than 20 years ago - human evolution in Asia was seen as very simple, with Homo erectus going out of Africa, settling in east and southeast Asia, and then nothing happened until the arrival of Homo sapiens at around 40,000 to 50,000 years ago and its conquest of every region on Earth, Dtroit said.With the discoveries made on the field - fossils - and in the lab, for instance genetics, we now know that it was a much more complex evolutionary history, with several distinct species contemporaneous with Homo sapiens, interbreeding events, extinctions, et cetera, Dtroit added.Homo sapiens was definitely not alone on Earth.
Scientists expected to release landmark image of black hole:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An international scientific team is expected on Wednesday to unveil a landmark achievement in astrophysics - the first photo of a black hole - in a feat that will put to the test a pillar of science: Albert Einsteins theory of general relativity.The first ever photo a black hole, taken using a global network of telescopes, conducted by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project, to gain insight into celestial objects with gravitational fields so strong no matter or light can escape, is shown in this handout photo released April 10, 2019.Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)/National Science Foundation/Handout via REUTERS Black holes are phenomenally dense celestial entities with gravitational fields so powerful no matter or light can escape, making them extraordinarily difficult to observe despite their great mass.News conferences are set in Washington, Brussels, Santiago, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo to disclose a groundbreaking result from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project, begun in 2012 to directly observe the immediate environment of a black hole using a global network of telescopes.A black holes event horizon is the point of no return beyond which anything - stars, planets, gas, dust and all forms of electromagnetic radiation - gets swallowed into oblivion.The project targeted two supermassive black holes residing at the center of different galaxies.The Washington news conference convened by the U.S. National Science Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Wednesday.Among those due to speak are astrophysicist Sheperd Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian.The research will test the theory of general relativity put forward in 1915 by Einstein, the famed theoretical physicist, to explain the laws of gravity and their relation to other natural forces.Einsteins theory allows for a prediction of the size and shape of a black hole.If the prediction turns out to be off the mark, the theory may need rethinking.This is separate from another key component of Einsteins broader theory of relativity: his 1905 theory of special relativity, part of the basis of modern physics.The theory of special relativity explaining the relationship between space and time.One of the black holes - Sagittarius A* - is situated at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, possessing 4 million times the mass of our sun and located 26,000 light years from Earth.A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).The second one - M87 - inhabits the center of the neighboring Virgo A galaxy, boasting a mass 3.5 billion times that of the sun and located 54 million light-years away from Earth.Streaming away from M87 at nearly the speed of light is a humongous jet of subatomic particles.Black holes, which come in different sizes, are formed when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle.Supermassive black holes are the largest kind, growing in mass as they devour matter and radiation and perhaps merging with other black holes.The fact that black holes do not allow light to escape makes viewing them difficult.The scientists will be looking for a ring of light - disrupted matter and radiation circling at tremendous speed at the edge of the event horizon - around a region of darkness representing the actual black hole.This is known as the black holes shadow or silhouette.The scientists said the shape of the shadow would be almost a perfect circle in Einsteins theory of general relativity, and if it turns out that it is not, there is something wrong with the theory.The projects researchers obtained the first data in April 2017 using telescopes in the U.S. states of Arizona and Hawaii as well as Mexico, Chile, Spain and Antarctica.Since then, telescopes in France and Greenland have been added to the global network.The global network of telescopes has essentially created a planet-sized observational dish.
Iran still planning three satellite launches this year, despite ramped up U.S. pressure: minister:::::GENEVA (Reuters) - Iran said on Tuesday it would press ahead with the launch of three satellites into orbit this year despite a U.S. move to curb Tehrans ballistic missile program which Washington says has been advanced by the satellite activity.U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would name Irans elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization, a move partly intended to curb the Islamic Republics development of ballistic missiles.The United States fears long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also be used to launch nuclear warheads.Iranian Telecoms Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi told Reuters in Geneva on Tuesday that Tehran would stick to its plans to launch three satellites and denied the U.S. accusation that such activity is a cover for ballistic missile development.The rockets which have currently been developed in Iran for carrying satellites are not something that are a cover for another kind of rocket activity, Azari-Jahromi said in an interview on the sidelines of a conference in Geneva.Because if Iran wants to have missile activity its something that it is doing openly.Its not something that is hidden.Its part of our right to defense.An Iranian attempt to launch a satellite in January failed, prompting U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to tweet: The launch yet again shows that Iran is pursuing enhanced missile capabilities that threaten Europe and the Middle East.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an interview with NBC News in February that Irans bid to launch a second satellite had also failed.Azari-Jahromi said Irans satellite program is intended for peaceful purposes such as helping manage water resources and protect the environment.The Islamic Republic has been hit by devastating flooding since mid-March that has killed at least 70 people and inundated some 1,900 communities.
In astrophysics milestone, first photo of black hole expected:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists are expected to unveil on Wednesday the first-ever photograph of a black hole, a breakthrough in astrophysics providing insight into celestial monsters with gravitational fields so intense no matter or light can escape.FILE PHOTO: A supermassive black hole with millions to billions times the mass of our sun is seen in an undated NASA artist's concept illustration.REUTERS/NASA/JPL-Caltech/Handout/File Photo The U.S. National Science Foundation has scheduled a news conference in Washington to announce a groundbreaking result from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project, an international partnership formed in 2012 to try to directly observe the immediate environment of a black hole.Simultaneous news conferences are scheduled in Brussels, Santiago, Shanghai, Taipei and Tokyo.A black holes event horizon, one of the most violent places in the universe, is the point of no return beyond which anything - stars, planets, gas, dust, all forms of electromagnetic radiation including light - gets sucked in irretrievably.While scientists involved in the research declined to disclose the findings ahead of the formal announcement, they are clear about their goals.Its a visionary project to take the first photograph of a black hole.We are a collaboration of over 200 people internationally, astrophysicist Sheperd Doeleman, director of the Event Horizon Telescope at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian, said at a March event in Texas.The news conference is scheduled for 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) on Wednesday.The research will put to the test a scientific pillar - physicist Albert Einsteins theory of general relativity, according to University of Arizona astrophysicist Dimitrios Psaltis, project scientist for the Event Horizon Telescope.That theory, put forward in 1915, was intended to explain the laws of gravity and their relation to other natural forces.SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLES The researchers targeted two supermassive black holes.The first - called Sagittarius A* - is situated at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy, possessing 4 million times the mass of our sun and located 26,000 light years from Earth.A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).The second - called M87 - resides at the center of the neighboring Virgo A galaxy, boasting a mass 3.5 billion times that of the sun and located 54 million light-years away from Earth.Streaming away from M87 at nearly the speed of light is a humongous jet of subatomic particles.Black holes, coming in a variety of sizes, are extraordinarily dense entities formed when very massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle.Supermassive black holes are the largest kind, devouring matter and radiation and perhaps merging with other black holes.Psaltis described a black hole as an extreme warp in spacetime, a term referring to the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time joined into a single four-dimensional continuum.Doeleman said the projects researchers obtained the first data in April 2017 from a global network of telescopes.The telescopes that collected that initial data are located in the U.S. states of Arizona and Hawaii as well as Mexico, Chile, Spain and Antarctica.Since then, telescopes in France and Greenland have been added to the network.The scientists also will be trying to detect for the first time the dynamics near the black hole as matter orbits at near light speeds before being swallowed into oblivion.The fact that black holes do not allow light to escape makes viewing them difficult.The scientists will be looking for a ring of light - radiation and matter circling at tremendous speed at the edge of the event horizon - around a region of darkness representing the actual black hole.This is known as the black holes shadow or silhouette.Einsteins theory, if correct, should allow for an extremely accurate prediction of the size and shape of a black hole.The shape of the shadow will be almost a perfect circle in Einsteins theory, Psaltis said.If we find it to be different than what the theory predicts, then we go back to square one and we say, Clearly, something is not exactly right.
Scientists solve mystery of pristine weapons of China's Terracotta Warriors:::::(Reuters) - For decades, scientists have been perplexed by the marvelous preservation of bronze weapons associated with Chinas famed Terracotta Warriors, retaining shiny, almost pristine surfaces and sharp blades after being buried for more than two millennia.FILE PHOTO: Terracotta warriors and horses, which were unearthed during the first excavation from 1978 to 1984, stand inside the No.1 pit of the Museum of Qin Terracotta Warriors and Horses in Xian, Shaanxi province, in China, January 8, 2018.REUTERS/Charles Platiau Research by an international team of scientists published on Thursday may solve the mystery while putting to rest an intriguing hypothesis: that ancient Chinese artisans employed an unexpectedly advanced preservation method using the metal chromium.The fine preservation of weapons including swords, lances and halberds was due to serendipity - factors such as the bronzes high tin content and favorable soil composition, the scientists decided after examining 464 bronze weapons and parts.Chromium found on the bronze surfaces, they determined, was simply contamination from chromium-rich lacquer applied by the artisans to the terracotta figures and weapons parts.Chromium played no role in their preservation.The Terracotta Army consists of thousands of life-sized ceramic warriors and horses alongside bronze chariots and weapons, part of the vast 3rd century BC mausoleum near the city of Xian for Qin Shi Huang, first emperor of a unified China.Found in 1974, it represents one of the 20th centurys greatest archaeological discoveries.Scientific analyses almost four decades ago detected chromium on the surface of some of the weapons, spurring the hypothesis that the weapon-makers used a chromium-based treatment to prevent corrosion.Chromium-conversion coating, a technology discovered in the early 20th century, is used to treat metals to render them more corrosion resistant.It involves dipping metal in a solution containing chromium salts.A chromium oxide layer is deposited on the metals surface, providing a barrier against rust.The lacquer was applied to the Terracotta Army as a primer before they were painted with colors, and we think its quite likely it was also applied to the now-decayed wooden parts such as handles and shafts, said University of Cambridge archaeological scientist Marcos Martinn-Torres, who led the study published in the journal Scientific Reports.Ancient bronzes often have poor states of preservation, with porous, pitted surfaces showing green or dark colors.In essence, we show that, yes, the Terracotta Army weapons generally show a very good state of preservation, but there is currently no indication that this is anything other than the result of chance, added Martinn-Torres, who participated in the research while at University College London and in collaboration with the Terracotta Army Museum.
Pentagon says India debris expected to burn up in atmosphere:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Thursday that it stood by its assessment that debris from an Indian anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons test would eventually burn up in the atmosphere, even after NASAs administrator warned of the danger the debris posed.India used an indigenously developed ballistic missile interceptor to destroy one of its own satellites at a height of 300 km (186 miles), in a test aimed at boosting its defenses in space.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said on Monday that more than 400 pieces of orbital debris from the test had been identified, including debris that was traveling above the International Space Station - something he called a terrible, terrible thing.Bridenstines assessment contrasted sharply with the one offered by Acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on March 28, when he played down the threat the debris might pose to satellites in space and said it was his understanding the debris would eventually burn up in the atmosphere.Asked on Thursday whether the Pentagon stood by Shanahans earlier assessment, spokesman Charlie Summers said: Yes.In 2007, China destroyed a satellite in a polar orbit, creating the largest orbital debris cloud in history, with more than 3,000 objects, according to the Secure World Foundation.Since the impact altitude exceeded 800 km (500 miles), many of the resulting scraps stayed in orbit.Shanahan said last week he believed India had avoided a similar scenario by testing at a lower altitude.Indias top defense scientist said the debris would burn up in 45 days.The White House struck a cautious tone on Thursday, saying it was aware of Indian government statements about its efforts to mitigate debris hazards.We will continue to closely monitor the remaining debris from Indias ASAT test to ensure the safety of assets on-orbit and human spaceflight activities such as the International Space Station, said Garrett Marquis, a National Security Council spokesman.Marquis said the United States remained committed to working with all nations to mitigate the operational effects of orbital debris.As part of our strategic partnership, the United States will continue close engagements with India on shared interests in space, he added, listing areas that included safety and security as well as human space exploration.
Pilot-less air taxi takes off in Vienna demonstration flight:::::VIENNA (Reuters) - As carmakers push ahead with self-driving vehicles, an Austrian aerospace company and its Chinese partner showed off their pilot-less flying taxi for the first time in Europe on Thursday.The drones 16 propellers hummed loudly as it rose above the pitch at Viennas Generali Arena, home to soccer club Austria Wien.The slim plane, which weighs 340 kg (750 pounds), circled in the air briefly and came down within a few minutes.The EHang 216, which can seat two passengers, has been tested comprehensively and is essentially ready for mass production, said Derrick Xiong, co-founder of Chinese drone maker EHang.Joining the race for new autonomous aircraft services that do not require runways, EHang entered a strategic partnership with Austrias FACC, owned by Chinese aerospace group AVIC, last year, aiming to offer short-haul services for passengers, industrial equipment and urgent medical deliveries.The drone can fly at up to 150 km per hour (90 mph) for almost half an hour, FACC Chief Executive Officer Robert Machtlinger said.It can travel between 50 and 70 kilometers depending on the payload.The passenger cabin is small, with leg room that taller passengers might find less-than adequate, an Austrian photographer who took part in a demonstration flight told Reuters.FACC says it has already received several thousand orders for the 300,000 euro ($336,000) drone, with the highest demand in China.Competitors working toward offering autonomous flying cars early in the next decade range from aerospace giant Airbus to Uber, and AeroMobil.Technically... urban mobility, flying without a pilot is possible, its not a dream, its existing, said Machtlinger.Slideshow (10 Images) What is hindering us to go into larger volumes is regulation, he added.A future legal framework for autonomous flying vehicles should regulate communication with other planes and helicopters and provide traffic rules, he said.Austria supports international efforts to quickly establish the necessary regulation, said transport minister Norbert Hofer.I hope that Austria will be the place where thousands of these drones, of these air taxis will be built and I hope that very soon we will see a lot of these air taxis in the air, Hofer said.
Parkinson's results beyond researchers' wildest dreams:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gail Jardine: "I can walk, I can turn... it's really helped me" A treatment that has restored the movement of patients with chronic Parkinson's disease has been developed by Canadian researchers.Previously housebound patients are now able to walk more freely as a result of electrical stimulation to their spines.A quarter of patients have difficulty walking as the disease wears on, often freezing on the spot and falling.Parkinson's UK hailed its potential impact on an aspect of the disease where there is currently no treatment.Prof Mandar Jog, of Western University in London, Ontario, told BBC News the scale of benefit to patients of his new treatment was "beyond his wildest dreams".Image copyright AFP Image caption Scientists monitor their patients' improvement using sensors on a specially made suit."Most of our patients have had the disease for 15 years and have not walked with any confidence for several years," he said."For them to go from being home-bound, with the risk of falling, to being able to go on trips to the mall and have vacations is remarkable for me to see."Normal walking involves the brain sending instructions to the legs to move.It then receives signals back when the movement has been completed before sending instructions for the next step.Image copyright BBC News/Western University Image caption The parts of the brain involved with movement (red on the left-hand scan) are not working properly, but three months into the trial those areas are now functioning Prof Jog believes Parkinson's disease reduces the signals coming back to the brain - breaking the loop and causing the patient to freeze.The implant his team has developed boosts that signal, enabling the patient to walk normally.However, Prof Jog was surprised that the treatment was long-lasting and worked even when the implant was turned off.He believes the electrical stimulus reawakens the feedback mechanism from legs to brain that is damaged by the disease."This is a completely different rehabilitation therapy," he said."We had thought that the movement problems occurred in Parkinson's patients because signals from the brain to the legs were not getting through."But it seems that it's the signals getting back to the brain that are degraded."Countryside walks Brain scans showed that before patients received the electrical treatment, the areas that control movement were not working properly.But a few months into the treatment those areas were restored.Gail Jardine, 66, is among the patients who has benefited from the treatment.Before she received the implant two months ago, Gail kept freezing on the spot, and she would fall over two or three times a day.She lost her confidence and stopped walking in the countryside in Kitchener, Ontario - something she loved doing with her husband, Stan.Now she can walk with Stan in the park for the first time in more than two years."I can walk a lot better," she said."I haven't fallen since I started the treatment.It's given me more confidence and I'm looking forward to taking more walks with Stan and maybe even go on my own".Image copyright Guy Alden Image caption Guy Alden used to rely on a wheelchair but after his treatment he had his first holiday in seven years with his wife, Barb Another beneficiary is Guy Alden, 70, a deacon at a catholic church in London, Ontario.He was forced to retire in 2012 because of his Parkinson's disease.His greatest regret was that it curtailed his work in the community, such as his prison visits."I was freezing a lot when I was in a crowd or crossing a threshold in a mall.Everyone would be looking at me.It was very embarrassing," he told me."Now I can walk in crowds.My wife and I even went on holiday to Maui and I didn't need to use my wheelchair at any point.There were a lot of narrow roads and a lot of (slopes) and I did all of that pretty well."Dr Beckie Port, research manager at Parkinson's UK, said: "The results seen in this small-scale pilot study are very promising and the therapy certainly warrants further investigation."Should future studies show the same level of promise, it has the potential to dramatically improve quality of life, giving people with Parkinson's the freedom to enjoy everyday activities."Follow Pallab on Twitter
Campaign to tackle 'botched' cosmetic procedures:::::Image copyright Rachael Knappier Image caption There have been calls for more regulation of non-surgical cosmetic procedures, such as lip fillers A campaign to tackle "botched" cosmetic procedures is to be launched shortly by the government in England.It follows a rise in people seeking surgeries such as a "Brazilian butt lift" abroad, which has led to deaths.There have also been warnings about the rise in the use of self-injected dermal and lip fillers, with the risk of causing complications that then have to be treated on the NHS.One expert welcomed the campaign, but said better regulation was also needed.England's Department of Health told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the campaign, scheduled to launch in the coming weeks, would look to ensure the public was fully informed about the importance of seeking professional advice regarding fillers, Botox and cosmetic surgery.It said it also hoped to tackle the number of "botched" procedures, and the resulting impact on a person's mental and physical health, as well as the cost to the NHS of treatment following such procedures.Nora Nugent, a member of the council of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (Baaps), said she welcomed the government campaign in principle.She said the estimated increase in people seeking cosmetic procedures had not been matched by improved education on what the public should expect when accessing treatments, or what could go wrong.While the rise of celebrities and influencers sharing their procedures online had led to increased uptake, she added, it was also due in part to "rising availability, better awareness of procedures and relatively more affordability".'My face was very distorted' "Greg" (not his real name) told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he became addicted to using dermal fillers - injections used to fill out wrinkles and creases in the skin, although they are also often used to increase the volume and definition of lips and cheeks.He bought them online - as well as Botox - and began self-injecting into his face three years ago."You can lose sight of reality of what your face looks like," he said."There was a point where I was doing it quite a lot and my mum was noticing that my face was very distorted, and I was losing a lot of my characteristics."You do not have to be a medical practitioner to administer such treatments, as filler solutions are not regulated like medicines.But self-injecting can cause swelling and infection, and in rare cases may need to be treated with surgery or medication if it causes lumps to form under the skin.It can also cause blindness.'Incredibly painful' One of Greg's self-injected lip fillers went wrong when he had an infection."I woke up the next morning, they were uneven - one side was bigger than the other," he said."I had blisters.It was incredibly, incredibly painful."I was embarrassed to seek help."Greg said he would now advise people not to use fillers, as it is a "slippery slope"."Knowing the complications now, you have to be incredibly careful."Ms Nugent, a consultant plastic surgeon, said she had concerns regarding so-called "cowboy injectors", such as beauticians, who administer fillers without medical training.This poses a risk, she said, as many are not qualified to suitably assess patients safely or to spot when complications do arise.She called for restrictions as to who can perform injectable treatments to be brought in.The Department of Health said: "Anyone considering a cosmetic procedure should take the time to find a reputable, safe, and qualified practitioner, and make sure they understand the impact of any treatment on their physical and mental health."We're working to improve the safety of cosmetic procedures, through better training and clear information so that people can make informed decisions about their care."In March, the Welsh government said it "may be appropriate in the future" to consult on adding dermal fillers to the licensing system.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Celebrities like Kylie Jenner have helped popularise lip fillers Save Face, a national register of accredited practitioners, said it received 934 patient complaints regarding unregistered practitioners in 2017-18.Of these, 616 related to dermal fillers.Ms Nugent said she was also concerned about people going abroad for cosmetic surgery - where patients may not see the surgeon until the day of the operation, and it is more difficult to have follow-up treatment that could be needed as a result of complications.She said this included - but was not limited to - Brazilian butt lift surgery, from which two British women have died.Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.
Older women exploited by IVF clinics, says fertility watchdog:::::Image copyright Science Photo Library Older women are being exploited by IVF clinics "trading on hope", the fertility watchdog has warned.Sally Cheshire, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), told the Daily Telegraph some private clinics were using "selective success rates" to target older women.IVF is less likely to be successful as a woman gets older.Since 2004 the number of women in their 40s undergoing fertility treatment has doubled to 10,835 in 2017.The latest HFEA figures show that, among those using their own eggs, out of 2,265 embryo transfers in 2017, just 75 women aged 43 to 44 ended up with a baby.For those over 44, the success rate was even lower - amounting to 1% between 2004 and 2017.Mrs Cheshire told the BBC that some women were not being told their "realistic chance of success" when sold the treatment.She said all UK clinics needed to be "transparent" about the costs involved, as well as the likely outcome.Mrs Cheshire added that the clinics giving "selective statistics" tended to be "foreign"."If you have treatment in the UK, all those clinics are regulated by us - by and large it's a good sector," she said."What we're concerned about are more of the foreign clinics who are coming to the UK who are investing here... who absolutely are not being honest."NHS guidelines recommend that women under 40 should be offered three full cycles of IVF, while those between 40 and 42 should be offered one full cycle.However eligibility criteria varies in different areas of the country.IVF is not usually recommended for women over the age of 42 because of low success rates.What is In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF)?Image copyright Getty Images An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory The fertilised egg is then returned to the woman's womb to develop IVF worked for the first time on 10 November 1977.On 25 July 1978, the world's first IVF baby, Louise Brown, was born On average, IVF fails 70% of the time The highest success rates are for women under 35 On average, it takes almost four-and-a-half years to conceive with IVF Source: Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority/Fertility Network UK Mrs Cheshire said some parts of the sector were using "blatant" sales tactics to persuade "vulnerable" women to undergo treatment.The 50-year-old said she had even been offered IVF treatments herself, by staff who were unaware of her role with the regulator, at a visit to a fertility show in Manchester."We now see things like 'guaranteed baby or your money back','' she told the Telegraph.Add-on treatments Mrs Cheshire also called for the watchdog to be given powers to regulate prices, saying that some private centres were charging up to 20,000 for cycles - four times as much as she said treatments should cost.She said prices were often inflated by the growing use of "add-on treatments", such as embryo glue and endometrial scratches, offered by clinics to boost chances of success.Caroline's story: 'Am I throwing away my money?'Caroline, 40, wishes someone had sat her down and given her a realistic cost for her IVF treatment but says that often medical staff do not know for sure.She was originally led to believe the cost would be 5,000 but it is now at least 16,000."The list of treatment costs is just jargon and there are so many options.I think I needed someone to sit me down and say to me 'this is you and this is what it will cost'," she said.The cost is not the only downside of IVF treatment for Caroline - the hormones have added negatively to the experience."I am taking some time off from treatment as I find injecting all the hormones really messes with me emotionally.The injections have bowled me over and made me completely lose it."Adding: "When you're crying your eyes out at work it's not a good look."However, Caroline, whose full name we are not using at her request, thinks she will continue with the treatment as she has two vials of sperm left and will likely spend another 10,000.However, earlier this year the watchdog, which regulates all fertility services in the UK, warned that these were being offered without conclusive evidence that they increase the chance of pregnancy.Its website now has a "traffic light" rating for such treatments.None have been given the green light, which indicates there is more than one quality trial showing the procedure is effective and safe.Have you undergone fertility treatment?Do you feel you were persuaded to do so?Please share your experiences by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.You can also contact us in the following ways:
The profoundly deaf girl who found her voice after brain surgery:::::Image copyright Guys and St Thomas NHS Seven-year-old Leia Armitage lived in total silence for the first two years of her life, but thanks to pioneering brain surgery and years of therapy she has found her voice and can finally tell her parents she loves them."We were told you could put a bomb behind her and she wouldn't hear it at all if it went off," said Leia's father, Bob, as he recalled finding out their baby daughter had a rare form of profound deafness.Leia, from Dagenham in east London, had no inner ear or hearing nerve, meaning that even standard hearing aids or cochlear implants wouldn't help her.As a result, she was never expected to speak - but despite the risks, her parents fought for her to be one of the first children in the UK to be given an auditory brainstem implant, requiring complex brain surgery when she was two years old.NHS England calls the surgery "truly life-changing" and has said it will fund the implant for other deaf children in a similar position.It is estimated that about 15 children a year will be assessed for the procedure and nine will go on to have surgery.Hear cars beeping Bob says opting for this type of brain surgery was a huge decision for them, but "we wanted to give Leia the best opportunity in life".He and his wife Alison hoped that after the surgery at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust she would be able to hear things like cars beeping their horns as she crossed the road - to make her safer in the world.However, in the five years since the surgery, her progress has been much greater than they ever expected.Image copyright Guys and St Thomas NHS Image caption Leia with her parents, Bob and Alison, and brother Jacob It started slowly, with Leia turning her head at the sound of train doors closing shortly after the operation.Gradually, she started to understand the concept of sound while her parents continually repeated words, asking her to mimic the sound.Now, after lots of regular speech and language therapy, she can put full sentences together, attempt to sing along to music and hear voices on the phone."We can call her upstairs when we're downstairs and she will hear us," Bob explains.'I love you' But it's at mainstream school, in a classroom with hearing children, where Leia is really flying, thanks to assistants using sign language and giving her plenty of one-to-one time."She is picking up more and more and she's not far behind others of her age in most things," Bob says.At home, using her voice is what pleases her parents most."'I love you Daddy' is probably the best thing I've heard her say," Bob says."When I'm putting her to bed she now says 'good night Mummy', which is something I never expected to hear," Alison says.The cutting-edge surgery involves inserting a device directly into the brain to stimulate the hearing pathways in children born with no cochlea or auditory nerves.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The implant is inserted directly into the brain next to the brainstem at the bottom of the brain A microphone and sound processor unit worn on the side of the head then transmits sound to the implant.This electrical stimulation can provide auditory sensations, but it cannot promise to restore normal hearing.However, Prof Dan Jiang, consultant otologist and clinical director of the Hearing Implant Centre at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, said some children can develop a degree of speech."The outcomes are variable.Some will do better than others," he said."They have to adapt to it and younger children do better so we like to insert the implant early if possible."Children under five are best placed to learn new concepts of sound and respond to intensive therapy, he said.Susan Daniels, chief executive of the National Deaf Children's Society, said: "Every deaf child is different and for some, technology like auditory brainstem implants can be the right option and can make a huge difference to their lives."With the right support, deaf children can achieve just as well as their hearing peers and this investment is another important step towards a society where no deaf child is left behind."
Targeted checks 'prevent one-in-10 heart attacks':::::Image copyright Getty Images Nearly one in 10 heart attacks and strokes in England and Wales could be prevented if routine check-ups were better targeted, say researchers.Currently, people aged 40 and over are eligible to have their heart health assessed every five years.But UCL scientists say people at low risk are being checked too often while those considered at high risk are not checked often enough.They say a personalised approach could save lives without costing any more.Chances of a heart attack or stroke can be worked out by looking at risk factors such as blood pressure, cholesterol and blood-sugar levels, age, family history and whether the person smokes.High-risk patients are told to change their lifestyle, and if that does not work they are offered statins to reduce "bad" cholesterol or drugs to lower blood pressure.Mounting risk The researchers followed 7,000 people to see how long they spent in different risk categories.The study, in the Lancet Public Health, showed: "Low-risk" patients took an average of nine years to reach "intermediate-low-risk" "Intermediate-low-risk" patients spent an average of seven years in this category; 90% went on to become "intermediate-high-risk" But within four years, 70% of "intermediate-high-risk" patients became "high-risk" and needed treatment The researchers then simulated different ways of screening people depending on their heart-risk category.For example, screening low-risk patients every seven years, intermediate-low every four years and intermediate-high every year cost the same as the current system.How big an impact?However, the targeted system would enable high-risk patients to be treated sooner and prevent 8% of heart attacks and strokes, say the researchers.That would prevent 5,000 people a year in England and Wales having a potentially life-threatening heart attack or stroke.Prof Mika Kivimaki, one of the researchers, said: "The key message is use individualised screening, not one-size-fits-all."I believe this will change because there is a tendency towards precision medicine and individualised treatment and prevention."I think this will be taken up in future and I hope it will happen sooner rather than later."The next stage of the research would be to perform a clinical trial to see whether switching screening methods would actually make a difference.Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "While changing the frequency of heart-health check-ups based on a person's individual risk could potentially save lives and costs, it's easier said than done."An issue that is even more important to address is why so many people who could benefit from health checks are not getting them in the first place."If you know you're at higher risk of developing heart and circulatory disease, it's really important to attend regular health checks to help manage your risk factors to prevent problems later in life."Follow James on Twitter.
Sore knee? Maybe you have a fabella:::::Image copyright Imperial College London Image caption The arrow on the scan shows where the fabella is - behind the knee A little bone in the knee scientists thought was being lost to evolution seems to be making a comeback, say experts from Imperial College London.The fabella is found in some people buried in the tendon just behind their knee.Doctors think it is entirely pointless, and you can happily live without it - many people do.However, people who have arthritis appear more likely to be in possession of a fabella.The Imperial College team has published its findings in the Journal of Anatomy.What is it?In medical terms, the fabella - which means little bean - is a sesamoid bone, meaning it grows in the tendon of a muscle, just like the kneecap or patella.How common is it?Dr Michael Berthaume and colleagues at Imperial's department of bioengineering have looked back at medical literature on knees over 150 years in 27 countries, including the UK.Between 1918 and 2018, reports of the fabella bone's existence in the knee increased to the extent that it is now thought to be three times as common as 100 years ago.The scientists' analysis showed that in 1918, fabellae were present in 11% of the world population, and by 2018, they were present in 39%.The researchers made their estimations using medical scans and medical journals' findings from a growing world population.Image copyright Imperial College London Image caption The fabella is found in the tissues behind the kneecap Why do some of us have it?Dr Berthaume said that no-one really knows the answer to that, because it has never been researched."The fabella may behave like other sesamoid bones to help reduce friction within tendons, redirecting muscle forces, or, as in the case of the kneecap, increasing the mechanical force of that muscle," he said."Or it could be doing nothing at all."Do we need it?In old world monkeys, the fabella can act as a kneecap, increasing the mechanical advantage of the muscle.But when the ancestors of great apes and humans evolved, it seemed to disappear.Now that it has returned, it is just causing us problems, according to experts.People with osteoarthritis of the knee are twice as likely to have the little bone, but there is no evidence it is actually causing the problem, or how.The fabella can also get in the way of knee replacement surgery and cause pain and discomfort on its own.So why is it making a comeback?The theory is that it is all to do with nutrition.Image copyright Getty Images The researchers came to the conclusion that better nutrition is making the average human taller and heavier, and this means we have longer shinbones and larger calf muscles.These changes put the knee under more pressure.Because sesamoid bones, like the fabella, are known to grow in response to the movements they make and the forces exerted on them, this could explain why the bone is more common than it used to be.Why is it important?Finding out about this little bone's resurgence could help doctors treat patients with knee issues.It could also give them an insight into human evolution over the past century.But first they want to find out the age, gender and location of people most likely to have a fabella, and if it occurs in one or both knees.
People with learning disabilities 'trapped' in hospitals as target missed:::::Image copyright Getty Images An NHS target to reduce the number of people with learning disabilities being treated in long-stay hospitals has been missed, resulting in more than 2,200 remaining in-patients in England.Charities say they are at risk of abuse and neglect in hospital units and should be cared for in homes in the community, close to their families.NHS England committed to halving the numbers in hospitals, but achieved 19%.It said it was investing in community care to help hundreds more people.Figures for March show that there are at least 2,260 people with learning disabilities or autism staying in hospitals in England - most for around two years, with half being kept in secure wards.The NHS target was to reduce numbers to 1,300-1,700 by now - from 2,805 in 2016.The commitment was a response to the abuse scandal exposed by the BBC at Winterbourne View specialist hospital near Bristol in 2012, when six care workers were jailed for abusing patients.NHS England said it was committed to supporting people with a learning disability or autism, and more than 650 people who had been in hospital for more than five years were now being supported in their communities.It said parts of the country were hitting their targets, helping people to live more independently, closer to home.But charity Mencap said "hundreds of people with a learning disability who should have been living in the community are still trapped in in-patient settings".The charity said families were often powerless to get them out and people could be locked up for years on end, instead of being supported in their communities.'Human rights scandal' Dan Scorer, head of policy at Mencap, said: "This is a domestic human rights scandal."We want government to prioritise social care reform and demand that the NHS and local authorities work together to reunite families and develop the right support across social care, health and education for children and adults with a learning disability in their communities."Children with learning disabilities are also sent to these hospitals, known as assessment and treatment units (ATUs) - and there were 240 patients under 18 being treated in these units last month.This is an increase from 110 in March 2015, although there have been fluctuations in numbers.Image caption Caroline's son Philip stayed in a special unit hundreds of miles from home for nearly two years 'Kept like an animal in a cage' Caroline Corfield's son Philip is 21 and has severe autism, learning difficulties and epilepsy.From 2015 to 2018, he lived in several different care homes and ATUs - the most recent one in Hull, more than 200 miles from his home in Croydon.Philip stayed there for 22 months.Caroline said the first time she visited him was the worst."He was being kept like an animal in a cage - he was in a seclusion room where he was being fed through a hatch."She was shocked by the fact his carers told her they were only spending two to three minutes interacting with him at a time."I felt like he was slipping away because the longer you leave him the harder it is to reintegrate him into society."In 2018, he started getting support in the community and is now living in his own home close to his family.Caroline says her son is much happier and more affectionate now."I can just walk into the house and see him and Philip can just give me a big hug.This is a contrast to his time spent in a secure unit, she says."I didn't feel like my opinions were being taken into account and I didn't feel like they were putting anything in place to make things better for him."
Mother 'felt suicidal' after baby death news reports:::::Image copyright Holly Eastall Image caption Holly Eastall and her baby son Louie who died from sudden infant death syndrome A mother who lost her son to cot death says she wants a change in how such cases are reported after misleading headlines left her feeling "suicidal".Holly Eastall, 23, from Kingston, south-west London, was grieving her baby when it was reported "child abuse officers" were investigating the case.All unexplained infant deaths are probed by child protection teams.Ms Eastall said that as a result of the reports she was accused of abusing her baby and considered suicide.She said she was sworn at in the street by strangers, spat on and ostracised by her friends.The reports were published just one day after her four-month-old son Louie died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).She is now calling for a change in the way child deaths are reported by journalists and has launched an online petition.Ms Eastall wants rules put in place that would prevent the media from reporting unexplained child deaths or identifying families until there is proof of foul play.But the Society of Editors, which fights for press freedoms, says it is not that simple - and argues media reports of infant deaths ensure fair judicial proceedings for cases which end up in court.Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) The NHS says sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) - known as "cot death" - is the sudden, unexpected and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby.In the UK more than 200 babies die suddenly and unexpectedly every year.Most deaths happen during the first six months of a baby's life.Infants born prematurely or with a low birth weight are at greater risk.SIDS usually occurs when a baby is asleep, although it can occasionally happen while they are awake.Parents can reduce the risk of SIDS by not smoking while pregnant or after the baby is born, and always placing the baby on their back when they sleep.Mother-of-three Ms Eastall said: "It really wasn't a nice thing for me to see, literally the day after my son died."Some of my friends turned against me, I had people in the street telling me I was disgusting."I had people making anonymous Facebook accounts telling me I should kill myself and I shouldn't have children."Image copyright IPetition/ Holly Eastall Image caption The family launched this petition calling for a change in the way child deaths are reported She told the BBC that when she saw the reports she was so distressed she contemplated suicide.Ms Eastall added: "They [the media] don't think about what they are doing.I wanted to kill myself when I saw it."If I didn't have my family, and my mum, and if I wasn't as strong as I am I don't know if I would've got through it."Ms Eastall also claims that several of the articles published just one day after Louie's death featured pictures of her home - which she says endangered her and her other children.She contacted the seven or eight news organisations which published the story but says she did not hear back from any of them.After she complained one added in a sentence clarifying that all child deaths are investigated by police, but she did not receive an apology.She added: "We set up this petition in order to help protect other families from having to face this trauma after losing a loved one."Her petition has already been signed by more than 13,000 people.Legal process Ian Murray, director of the Society of Editors, said: "While no one could do other than sympathise with anyone who has to deal with the terrible circumstances of the loss of a child or any loved one, to create a situation where no deaths can be reported unless foul play is confirmed is impractical in an open and free society."The whole process of British law which includes investigations into deaths by the coroner is intended to take place before the eyes of the world."This is as much to protect those at the centre of any allegations or investigations as to ensure any victims receive justice."At a time when social media is rife with rumour and speculation, to inhibit the media from reporting the actual circumstances surrounding a death would be totally counter-productive."A spokeswoman for the Lullaby Trust, which provides support for families who have lost a child to SIDS, said: "It is very important that the media consider the impact their coverage can have on a bereaved family and to ensure that they report accurately and sensitively."Sensationalist reporting can cause a family a great deal of additional distress during an immensely difficult time and perpetuate misunderstanding about SIDS."Social media star Mrs Hinch threw her support behind the campaign, which hopes to garner 100,000 signatures so it can be debated in Parliament.If you or someone you know has been affected by child bereavement, visit BBC Action Line for a list of organisations which may be able to help.
HIV used to cure 'bubble boy' disease:::::Image copyright Courtesy of St Jude Children's Research Hospital Image caption Gael, a patient at St Jude Children's Research Hospital who received treatment, with his mother US scientists say they used HIV to make a gene therapy that cured eight infants of severe combined immunodeficiency, or "bubble boy" disease.Results of the research, developed at a Tennessee hospital, were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.The babies, born with little to no immune protection, now have fully functional immune systems.Untreated babies with this disorder have to live in completely sterile conditions and tend to die as infants.The gene therapy involved collecting the babies' bone marrow and correcting the genetic defect in their DNA soon after their birth.Image copyright SPL Image caption David Vetter, who came to be known in the 1970s as the bubble boy The "correct" gene - used to fix the defect - was inserted into an altered version of one of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.Researchers said most of the babies were discharged from the hospital within one month.Dr Ewelina Mamcarz of St Jude, an author of the study, said in a statement: "These patients are toddlers now, who are responding to vaccinations and have immune systems to make all immune cells they need for protection from infections as they explore the world and live normal lives.""This is a first for patients with SCID-X1," she added, referring to the most common type of SCID.The patients were treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis and at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital in San Francisco.What is this syndrome?The case of David Vetter is perhaps the most famous case of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), a disease that made it impossible for him to engage with the world outside a plastic chamber.Nicknamed "Bubble Boy", Vetter was born in 1971 with the disease and died at the age of 12 after a failed bone marrow transplant.Image copyright Getty Images Within 20 seconds of his birth at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, he was placed in a plastic isolation chamber, where he lived until the age of six when he was given a special plastic suit designed by Nasa, the US space agency.His parents had already lost one child to the disease before he was born.Image copyright Getty Images What are other treatment options?Currently, the best treatment for SCID-XI is a bone marrow transplant with a tissue-matched sibling donor.But according to St Jude, more than 80% of these patients lack such donors and must rely on blood stem cells from other donors.This process is less likely to cure the bubble boy disease, and is more likely to cause serious side effects as a result of treatment.Previous advancements in gene therapy provided alternatives to a bone marrow transplant, but these treatments sometimes involved chemotherapy and had implications for a range of other diseases, including blood disorders, sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia, and metabolic syndrome.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption When Rhys Harris had his treatment, his parents did not know if he would survive You may also be interested in: Gene therapy treats 'bubble boy'
Pig brains partially revived four hours after death:::::Image copyright Getty Images US scientists have partially revived pig brains four hours after the animals were slaughtered.The findings could fuel debate about the barrier between life and death, and provide a new way of researching diseases like Alzheimer's.The study showed the death of brain cells could be halted and that some connections in the brain were restored.However, there were no signals from the brain that would indicate awareness or consciousness.The surprise findings challenge the idea that the brain goes into irreversible decline within minutes of the blood supply being cut off.How was it done?Thirty-two pig brains were collected from an abattoir.Four hours later the organs were connected to a system made by the team at Yale University.It rhythmically pumped (to mimic the pulse) a specially designed liquid round the brain, which contained a synthetic blood to carry oxygen and drugs to slow or reverse the death of brain cells.The pig brains were given the restorative cocktail for six hours.What did the study show?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The researchers found synapses - the connections between brains - were working The study, published in the journal Nature, showed a reduction in brain cell death, the restoration of blood vessels and some brain activity.The researchers found working synapses - the connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate.The brains also showed a normal response to medication and used up the same amount of oxygen as a normal brain.This was all 10 hours after the pigs were decapitated.Crucially there was no sign of the brain-wide electrical activity in an electroencephalogram (EEG brain scan) that would signal awareness or perception.Fundamentally they were still dead brains.What have we learned?The research transforms ideas about how the brain dies, which many thought happened quickly and irreversibly without a supply of oxygen.Prof Nenad Sestan, a professor of neuroscience at Yale University, said: "Cell death in the brain occurs across a longer time window that we previously thought."What we are showing is the process of cell death is a gradual, stepwise process."And that some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved or even reversed."Are these experiments ethical?The pig brains came from the pork industry; the animals were not raised in a lab for this experiment.But the Yale scientists were so concerned the pigs might become conscious that they gave drugs to the disembodied brains to reduce any brain activity.And the team were constantly monitoring the brains to see if there was any sign of higher brain functions.In that case they would have used anaesthetic and ended the experiment.Ethicists, writing in Nature, say new guidelines are needed for this field because animals used for research could end up in a "grey area - not alive, but not completely dead".What is the point?Image copyright Getty Images The immediate benefit of this work will be for scientists studying the brain in diseases like Alzheimer's.The organ is the most complex structure in the known universe, but techniques such as freezing slices of the brain or growing colonies of brain cells in a dish do not let researchers explore the full 3D wiring of the brain.In the long term, scientists hope to find better ways of protecting the brain after traumas such as a stroke or being starved of oxygen at birth.Dr Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, from the Brain Initiative at the US National Institute of Mental Health, said: "This line of research could lead to a whole new way of studying the post-mortem brain."It also could stimulate research to develop interventions that promote brain recovery after loss of brain blood flow."However, the researchers say it is still far too early for the field to make a difference to patients after injury.Prof Sestan said: "We don't yet have knowledge whether we would be able to restore normal brain function."Does this change the meaning of death?At the moment no, but some ethicists say we should have the debate now as people who are "brain dead" are a major source of organs for transplant.Prof Dominic Wilkinson, a professor of medical ethics and a consultant neonatologist in Oxford, said: "Once someone has been diagnosed as 'brain dead' there is currently no way for that person to ever recover."The human person that they were has gone forever."If, in the future, it were possible to restore the function of the brain after death, to bring back someone's mind and personality, that would, of course, have important implications for our definitions of death."But that is not currently the case.Prof Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: "This study is a long way from preserving human brain function after death as portrayed in the cartoon Futurama where heads were kept alive in a jar."It is instead a temporary preservation of some of the more basic cell functions in the pig brain, not the preservation of thought and personality."Could the pigs' brains be aware?In this experiment the answer is a clear no.The brains were effectively silent.But the research does ask as many questions as it answers: How long can the researchers keep brains going?Would the results be even better if the researchers did not wait four hours before starting?Also, the team used drugs to suppress brain activity - would the decapitated brains have been aware if they hadn't?Follow James on Twitter.
Pembrokeshire GP job ad admits 'the hours stink':::::Image copyright Dave Wilson Image caption Dave Wilson tweeted "you make a difference and so despite it all this is why we're still plodding" A GP has tweeted a job advert for his surgery saying: "I won't sugarcoat it... we're heavily undermanned and the hours stink."Dave Wilson, from Pembroke Dock, Pembrokeshire, said his surgery, Argyle Medical Group, had just eight GPs looking after 22,500 patients.Retirements and a lack of people moving to the area are adding to the shortage.Hywel Dda health board has faced "significant workforce challenges" despite recruitment efforts.Dr Wilson, 37, said he was not a "prolific tweeter", but was attempting to drum up interest after seeing the number of doctors at his surgery almost halve.Skip Twitter post by @davewilson2 Anyone looking to be a GP in Pembroke Dock?I wont sugarcoat it at the moment were heavily undermanned and the hours stink.However the patients are genuine, the staff are great, you make a difference and so despite it all this is why were still plodding...

Ipswich 'killing-suicide': Crisis team 'missed opportunity':::::Image copyright Facebook Image caption Thomas and Katherine Kemp were found dead in Ipswich on 6 August A mental health trust has been criticised for failing to prevent a patient killing his wife and then taking his own life.Thomas and Katherine Kemp were found dead in Ipswich on 6 August.An inquest heard Mrs Kemp, 31, was found with 28 knife wounds at the flat she shared with her husband, 32.Ipswich coroner Jacqueline Devonish said the refusal to offer Mr Kemp a bed or assessment was a "missed opportunity" to prevent their deaths.She criticised Norfolk and Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust (NSFT)'s crisis team for not intervening, after the couple had visited hospital in the early hours of 6 August.'Desperately reached out' University worker Mr Kemp was found outside the communal entrance to the block of flats in Siloam Place, where he was believed to have fallen from the window, and the couple were pronounced dead shortly after 09:30.The couple were described as "deeply in love".In a statement to the court, Mrs Kemp's family described her as Mr Kemp's "rock" and as "gentle, loyal and brave".His family said the couple had "desperately reached out for help" but that the trust had "failed not just Thomas but his wonderful partner Katherine".Image caption Police took the couple to A&E earlier on in the day before the couple were found dead Mr Kemp had previously been assessed as suffering from anxiety, body dysmorphic ideas and paranoid delusions.The inquest previously heard that police officers had taken the couple to A&E at around 03:00 on the day of their deaths after Mr Kemp had threatened to kill himself.PC Andrew Overton said the couple had appeared "calm" but he had seen a large kitchen knife on the floor near Mr Kemp's feet.The inquest also heard Mr Kemp had been turned away by the mental health crisis team because they believed the episode was related to his anxiety about the size of his penis.Recording a narrative conclusion Ms Devonish said Mr Kemp stabbed his wife during a psychotic episode when she tried to prevent him from harming himself.He then cut himself, fell from a window and bled to death.She said Mr Kemp's "non-compliance with prescribed medication" and the "failure of the crisis response team to see [Mrs Kemp] and her husband and undertake an assessment" contributed to the deaths.Image caption Dorian Goldsmith described Thomas and Katherine Kemp as "inseparable" NSFT chief nurse Diane Hull said the trust had commissioned a review alongside East Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust (ESNEFT) to examine the treatment provided to Mr Kemp.She said: "There is an absolute need to learn what went wrong and why, so that services can be improved and, most importantly, prevent another family suffering what Mr and Mrs Kemp's families have been through."Friend of the couple Dorian Goldsmith said they were some of the "kindest people I knew".He said: "They were both very intellectual.They were both kind of geeky, both loved doing things like Comic Con together and dressing up."They both enjoyed the waterfront, you would see them walking hand-in-hand together."They were inseparable, they absolutely loved each other.I've never seen a relationship quite like it."
The Priory fined £300k over death of 14-year-old girl:::::Image copyright Family handout / PA Image caption Amy El-Keria was found hanged in her room in November 2012 The Priory healthcare group has been fined 300,000 over the death of a child at one of its hospitals.Amy El-Keria, 14, was found hanged in her room at the Priory in Ticehurst, East Sussex, in November 2012.The private company, which runs mental health services as part of an NHS contract, was sentenced at Lewes Crown Court.In 2016, an inquest found her death may have been prevented if she had received proper care.'Profit over safety' The Health and Safety Executive pursued a criminal investigation and the company admitted a charge of being an employer failing to discharge its duty to ensure people were not exposed to health and safety risks.In sentencing, Judge Mr Justice James Dingemans said no financial penalty he could impose would ever "reflect the loss suffered by Amy's family".Speaking outside court, Amy's mother Tania El-Keria said: "The public's eye has been firmly opened to what the Priory stand for, profit over safety."Today is a historic day in our fight for justice for Amy."Our Amy died in what we know to be a criminally unsafe hospital being run by the Priory."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amy's mother Tania El-Keria said: "I've been fighting so long to get the justice for her" Asked about the size of the penalty, Ms El-Keria said: "It's not about the fine, it's not about the money."She said the Priory's contract with the NHS should not carry on."I don't believe there's any lessons learned," she added.A court hearing in January was told Amy, who was deemed high-risk and had a "known and recent history" of suicide attempts, was admitted to the hospital on 23 August 2012.She was left with unsupervised access and the means to carry out another suicide attempt.On November 12, she was found with a ligature around her neck and taken to Conquest Hospital in Hastings, where she died the next day.The inquest into her death heard staff at the unit had not been trained in resuscitation and did not call 999 quickly enough.The jury said Amy died of unintended consequences of a deliberate act, contributed to by neglect, and that staffing levels at the Ticehurst centre were inadequate.Priory faces heavy fine over girl's death Hospital 'neglected' girl found hanged Judge Dingemans said: "It is apparent from the investigations that have been carried out in Amy's death, and the works carried out by Priory Healthcare and the CQC [Care Quality Commission], that there is now a much better understanding of young person suicide, and that vital lessons have been learned."When imposing the fine, he said he took into account the company's "good" health and safety record, guilty plea and steps made to improve the service.Priory Healthcare had a turnover of 133m in 2017, with an operating profit of 2m, he said.It must also pay the Health and Safety Executive's costs of 65,800 and a victim surcharge of 120.Image copyright The Priory Group Image caption Amy El-Keria was admitted to the Priory Hospital in Ticehurst a few months before she died In a statement, the charity Inquest, which supported the family, said it was "a historic moment in terms of accountability following deaths of children in private mental health settings".Victoria McNally, a senior caseworker at the charity, said: "Allowing the Priory to investigate their own actions, meant it took six-and-a-half years for their criminally unsafe practises to be exposed."If we are serious about child safety and welfare, such a blatant lack of oversight and scrutiny cannot continue."Trevor Torrington, head of the Priory Group, said: "The latest CQC report, published in January this year, rated Ticehurst as "good" in all areas."We remain absolutely focussed on patient safety and will continue to work closely with commissioners and regulators to learn lessons from incidents and inspections quickly and ensure all concerns are addressed in a timely and robust way.

A rasher of bacon a day 'ups cancer risk':::::Image copyright Getty Images Even small amounts of red and processed meat - such as a rasher of bacon a day - can increase the risk of bowel cancer, according to research.The latest study led by Oxford University and funded by Cancer Research UK, adds to evidence, including from the World Health Organization, that eating red meat can be harmful.But exactly how big is the risk?And how much is too much?Here's what you need to know.What the study found: Researchers analysed data from almost half a million people involved in the UK Biobank study.Over the six years of their study they found 2,609 people developed bowel cancer.They estimate: Eating three rashers of bacon a day rather than just one could increase the risk of bowel cancer by 20% For every 10,000 people in the study who ate 21g a day of red and processed meat, 40 were diagnosed with bowel cancer The comparable figure for those who ate 76g a day, was 48 According to the NHS, 76g of cooked red meat is equivalent to about half an 8oz sirloin steak.A slice of ham or rasher of bacon is about 23g of processed meat.How much is too much?It's not clear.Cancer Research UK (CRUK) says 5,400 of the 41,804 cases of bowel cancer seen each year in the UK could be prevented if people did not eat processed meat at all.According to Emma Shields, information manager at CRUK, "This study shows the more meat you eat, the higher your risk of getting cancer and obviously the reverse is true - the less you eat the less likely you are to get bowel cancer," But she acknowledges smoking poses a much bigger risk, causing 54,300 cases of cancer each year.Public Health England says from its surveys many people eat too much red and processed meat.And experts advise people who eat lots of it to find ways to cut down.The Department of Health advises anyone eating more than 90g a day of red and processed meat should cut down to 70g.Is eating some OK?NHS guidance says there are some benefits of red meat - iron and protein content, for example - that must be balanced against potential risks.People can still eat meat and be healthy.What makes it risky?Processed meat - including bacon, some sausages, hot dogs, salami - is modified to either extend its shelf-life or change the taste - the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives.It is thought the chemicals involved in the processing could be increasing the risk of cancer.High temperature cooking, such as on a barbecue, can also create carcinogenic chemicals.When it comes to red meat like beef, lamb and pork, there are suggestions that one of the proteins (that gives it its red colour) can damage the gut when it is broken down.But experts are still trying to fully understand the link.What do experts say?Prof Gunter Kuhnle, at the University of Reading, described the study as a very thorough analysis of the link between meat intake and bowel (also known as colorectal) cancer.He said: "The results confirm previous findings that both, red and processed meat consumption, increase the risk of colorectal cancer."The increase in risk of approximately 20% per 50g increase of red and processed meat intake is in line with what has been reported previously, and confirms these findings."The study also shows that dietary fibre reduces the risk of colorectal cancer.An increased consumption of fibre, as shown by this study, would be of considerably more benefit."Carrie Ruxton, of the Meat Advisory Panel, an industry-funded body, said: "Red meat provides valuable nutrients, such as protein, iron, zinc, vitamin D and B vitamins."She said it was known that "a range of lifestyle factors have a significant impact on the risk of bowel cancer, most notably age, genetics, lack of dietary fibre, inactivity and high alcohol consumption".The study is published in the International Journal of Epidemiology.
Breech baby scan 'would save lives':::::Image copyright Getty Images Mums-to-be could be routinely offered an ultrasound scan at 36 weeks to help spot risky breech deliveries, when a baby's bottom or feet will emerge first, say UK researchers.Breech births can be hazardous and tricky to diagnose.Currently, midwives and doctors tend to rely on the shape and feel of the mother's bump to check.Researchers estimate the scans would avoid 4,000 emergency caesareans and eight baby deaths a year in England.If the scans could be done cheaply enough then it should also save the NHS money in terms of care, says the University of Cambridge team in the journal PLoS Medicine.About three to four babies in every 100 are in a breech position near the end of pregnancy.More babies start out breech but will turn to the ideal "head-first" position by about 36 weeks' gestation.The researchers offered breech scans to 3,879 pregnant women: 179 (4.6%) were found to be breech In more than half of these cases (96 of the pregnancies or 55%) there had been no suspicion until the scan result Making the diagnosis at 36 weeks meant the women could be offered an attempt at manually encouraging the baby to turn in the womb to the head-first position before labour - a manipulation method called external cephalic version.For the women who declined, or where it did not work, a planned caesarean section was arranged.None of the women opted to attempt a vaginal breech birth, which is possible but carries some risk.Nineteen of the 179 women were able to deliver vaginally, 110 had a planned caesarean and 50 needed an emergency caesarean.Implications Researcher Prof Gordon Smith said it should be feasible to provide the service at a low cost, for example by making it a part of a standard midwife appointment and using inexpensive portable ultrasound machines."If it was under 20 per patient then it would be cost-effective and if it could be done for under 13 then it should save the NHS money in the long run," he said.Experts said the cost-effectiveness for the NHS should be explored.Private patients can pay from 30 to 200 or more for a pregnancy ultrasound scan.Prof Andrew Shennan, professor of obstetrics at King's College London, said the scans should be rolled out."Breech can be difficult to manage in labour if previously unsuspected, as labour can be quick," he said."Breech deliveries have some risk, and counselling and decision-making in labour can be challenging.Scans are routinely available now, and minimal skills are required to determine breech presentation.This should be implemented."But Prof Jean Golding, emeritus professor of paediatric and perinatal epidemiology at the University of Bristol, disagrees.She said bigger, randomised trials were needed first.Prof Basky Thilaganathan, from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said more research was needed, but added: "So far, the evidence for its use looks very promising."
Technology to keep dementia patients out of hospital:::::Image copyright Imperial College London Sensors small enough to fit in the ear, robotic devices and sleep monitors could all become standard technology in the homes of people with dementia, scientists say.The idea is to keep people safe and independent in their own homes, rather than needing to go to hospital.Scientists, engineers and doctors are working to develop the technology at Imperial College London.They say much of it is affordable and "could be usable in five years".Some of the technology already exists, but researchers at the new Care Research & Technology Centre in London now want to extend it and tailor it for use by dementia patients in their daily lives.They are looking at developing an EEG (electroencephalogram) device which fits in the ear to monitor fluctuations in brain activity and using radar technology to track people's movements in their own home.Image copyright Imperial College London Image caption A device which fits in the ear could monitor brain fluctuations in people with dementia The aim is for sensors around the home to pick up changes in patients' behaviour which could put them at risk of being admitted to hospital, such as a change in walking pattern that could lead to a fall, or an increase in body temperature which could suggest an infection.Sensors and devices worn at home can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and brain activity, while tracking sleep activity.The technology can then alert doctors or nurses at an early stage if there are any potential problems.'Quick and effective' Trevor Truman, whose wife was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2016, tested some of the technology as part of a trial in his own home.Blood pressure readings from a sensor indicated his wife needed to see a GP."When we visited the GP, we were able to take my wife's data with us - using the app on my tablet - giving our GP an instant overview of her health and recent history."New medication was prescribed that day."It was quick, efficient and effective for us."At one point, Mr Truman had up to 20 separate sensors or devices gathering data in his house - some monitored sleep patterns, room temperature or unusual movements.Others monitored weight, body temperature and hydration levels.Image copyright Professor David Sharp, Imperial College London Image caption How a healthy dementia home could look, according to researchers Prof David Sharp, neurologist and head of the technology centre, which is part of the UK Dementia Research Institute, Imperial College London, said the new technologies would improve support for people in their homes, while also improving understanding of how dementia progresses."They will allow us to intervene at an early stage, to prevent crises that so often lead to hospital stays, or a move to a care home."There are 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK and this is forecast to rise to 2 million people by 2051.One in four hospital beds is occupied by someone with dementia - and 20% of these admissions were due to preventable causes, he said.Every six months, 50 people with dementia and their carers will be asked to test the technology in their own homes by the University of Surrey.Image copyright Imperial college london Image caption Door sensors can monitor movements in the home and alert doctors to any changes The ultimate aim is to create "healthy homes" for people with dementia to live in using the technology.Although it is not known how the technology will be funded, scientists said some elements would be free, like memory apps, and some sensors could costs as little as 10.Payam Barnaghi, professor of machine intelligence at the University of Surrey, said: "Doctors will be able to have confidence in their ability to monitor people remotely and to react quickly to any worrying changes."Improving the quality of life of people with dementia is crucial to their and their families' overall wellbeing."
Statins 'don't work well for one in two people':::::Image copyright Getty Images Cholesterol-lowering "statin" drugs taken by millions of Britons may not work well enough in about half of those prescribed them, research suggests.UK investigators looked at 165,000 patients on statins and found that for one in two, the drugs had too little effect on bad cholesterol - one of the big risk factors for heart disease.They are not sure why statins appear to help some more than others.Patients should not stop taking the drugs without seeing their doctor.One possible explanation is patients not taking their prescribed drugs or doctors giving them at too low doses, experts suggest.Cardiovascular disease kills about 150,000 people in the UK each year."Bad" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a major contributor - it can lead to furring and blockage of blood vessels.Smoking and obesity Cutting down on saturated fat can help lower bad cholesterol, but some people will also need medication.Millions of people in the UK are given statins for this reason.But statins can cause side effects and there is a debate about how many patients should be prescribed them.The study, published in the journal Heart, included 165,411 patients who had been put on statins to cut their risk of developing heart disease by lowering their cholesterol to a healthy level.Half of the patients - 84,609 in total - did not see their cholesterol go down by enough - the required 40% or more reduction specified by guidelines - even after being on the daily treatment for two years.Experts say the study findings are somewhat limited because they cannot prove that patients who do not respond well to statins will necessarily fare worse as a consequence.Other factors - like smoking and obesity - also raise cardiovascular risk.But the work does provide "real life" data and experience to draw on.Researcher Dr Stephen Weng, from Nottingham University, said: "Our research has shown that in almost half of patients prescribed statins, they are very effective and offer significant protection against cardiovascular disease."However, for the other half - whether it's due to your genetic make-up, having side effects, sticking to the treatment or other medications - we don't see that intended benefit."'Mixed messaging' In the study, a higher proportion of patients with a sub-optimal response to statins were prescribed lower potency doses, compared with those with an optimal response.He said: "We have to develop better ways to understand differences between patients and how we can tailor more effective treatment for those millions of patients who are simply blanket-prescribed statins."Prof Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, advised: "Statins are an important and proven treatment for lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of a potentially fatal heart attack or stroke."If you have been prescribed statins, you should continue to take them regularly, as prescribed.If you have any concerns you should discuss your medication with your GP.There are now other drugs available to help lower cholesterol levels, and it may be that another type of medication will be an effective addition or alternative for you."Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said: "When we prescribe medication, we have to rely on patients to make sure that they take it, both at the recommended dose and for the duration of time that we think will benefit them most."There is a substantial body of research showing that statins are safe and effective drugs for most people, and can reduce the risk of heart attacks and stroke, when prescribed appropriately - but controversy remains around their widespread use and their potential side-effects."There are complex reasons why patients choose not to take their prescribed medication, and mixed messaging around statins could be one of these."
Epilepsy charity calls for social media seizure warnings:::::Image copyright iStock Image caption Unlike TV programmes, social media platforms do not have to give warnings when potentially harmful flashing images are about to appear A growing number of people with epilepsy have said they are having seizures triggered by flashing images on social media, a charity has warned.The Epilepsy Society wants the government's new plans to tackle "online harms" to recommend warnings about flashing images on social media.More than 18,000 people in the UK are thought to have epilepsy that can be triggered by photosensitivity.The charity says cyber-bullies post malicious content intentionally.The Epilepsy Society says anyone found guilty of posting harmful images intentionally should be prosecuted for assault.The government said it would consult with the charity on the issue.Facebook - which also owns Instagram - said it had "strict policies in place to help people who encounter abusive behaviour".Unlike TV programmes, which are regulated by Ofcom, social media sites do not have to give a warning when potentially harmful flashing images are about to appear.About 20,000 people in the UK have photosensitive epilepsy - where seizures are triggered by flashing lights or contrasting, fast-moving images, according to the Epilepsy Society.The condition is most common in children and young people.Epilepsy Society chief executive Clare Pelham said many Facebook and Instagram users shared videos with potentially dangerous content without realising the risk they posed."However, when it comes to deliberately targeting people with epilepsy with the intention of causing a seizure... we need to call that behaviour what it is - a pre-meditated and pre-planned intention to assault," she said."The government must bring this behaviour within the reach of the criminal law."Malicious social media posts appear to have useful information about epilepsy on them, but have images embedded designed to provoke a seizure.The posts are tagged with keywords around epilepsy to "deliberately target those with the condition", the Epilepsy Society said.'Absolute minefield' Sophie Harries, a 22-year-old dietitian from Somerset, was diagnosed with photosensitive epilepsy aged 15.She said it used to be easier to avoid her seizure triggers, although she was not able to go clubbing, in case there was strobe lighting."That is still the case, but now I have to be careful of any videos uploaded to social media that contain strobe lighting or flashing imagery," she said."The videos tend to play automatically putting me at risk of a seizure.If my friends have been out clubbing I have to avoid social media for a while."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sophie says it used to be easier to avoid her seizure triggers.She recently reported a film trailer to Instagram that contained flashing lights, but it said the video did not breach its terms of usage, she said."You can un-follow posts but they still tend to follow you around."Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Harries said she recently came across a video containing flashing images, which was tagged deliberately to the Epilepsy Society's Instagram page "in order to harm"."For a 15-year-old today it is an absolute minefield.Young people are permanently on social media with friendship groups."The Epilepsy Society has written to Digital Secretary Jeremy Wright asking for his reassurance that the new Online Harms paper will safeguard people with epilepsy.A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, said: "We will place a legally binding duty of care on companies towards their users, overseen by an independent regulator who will set clear safety standards."We are currently consulting on this, and want to hear from the Epilepsy Society, and others, about what steps they would like to see platforms take to make the internet a safer place."A spokesperson for Facebook and Instagram told the BBC that "everyone deserves to enjoy the benefits of the internet safely", adding the organisations were exploring ways to make platforms "more inclusive".
Sleep myths 'damaging your health':::::Image copyright Getty Images Widely held myths about sleep are damaging our health and our mood, as well as shortening our lives, say researchers.A team at New York University trawled the internet to find the most common claims about a good night's kip.Then, in a study published in the journal Sleep Health, they matched the claims to the best scientific evidence.They hope that dispelling sleep myths will improve people's physical and mental health and well-being.So, how many are you guilty of?Myth 1 - You can cope on less than five hours' sleep This is the myth that just won't go away.Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously had a brief four hours a night.German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made similar claims, and swapping hours in bed for extra time in the office is not uncommon in tales of business or entrepreneurial success.Yet the researchers said the belief that less than five hours' shut-eye was healthy, was one of the most damaging myths to health."We have extensive evidence to show sleeping five hours or less consistently, increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences," said researcher Dr Rebecca Robbins.These included cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, and shorter life expectancy.Instead, she recommends everyone should aim for a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep a night.Thatcher: Can people get by on four hours' sleep?Myth 2 - Alcohol before bed boosts your sleep The relaxing nightcap is a myth, says the team, whether it's a glass of wine, a dram of whisky or a bottle of beer.Image copyright Getty Images "It may help you fall asleep, but it dramatically reduces the quality of your rest that night," said Dr Robbins.It particularly disrupts your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is important for memory and learning.So yes, you will have slept and may have nodded off more easily, but some of the benefits of sleep are lost.Alcohol is also a diuretic, so you may find yourself having to deal with a full bladder in the middle of the night too.Myth 3 - Watching TV in bed helps you relax Have you ever thought "I need to wind down before bed, I'm going to watch some TV"?Well, the latest Brexit twists and turns on the BBC News at Ten might be bad for sleep.Dr Robbins argues: "Often if we're watching the television it's the nightly news it's something that's going to cause you insomnia or stress right before bed when we're trying to power down and relax."And as for Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue the Red Wedding was relaxing.The other issue with TV - along with smartphones and tablets - is they produce blue light, which can delay the body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin.Will the light from your phone kill you?Myth 4 - If you're struggling to sleep, stay in bed You've spent so long trying to nod off you've managed to count all the sheep in New Zealand (that's about 28 million).So what should you do next?The answer is not to keep trying."We start to associate our bed with insomnia," said Dr Robbins."It does take the healthy sleeper about 15 minutes to fall asleep, but much longer than that make sure to get out of bed, change the environment and do something that's mindless."Her tip - go fold some socks.Myth 5 - Hitting the snooze button Who isn't guilty of reaching for the snooze button on their phone, thinking that extra six minutes in bed is going to make all the difference?But the research team says that when the alarm goes off, we should just get up.Image copyright Getty Images Dr Robbins said: "Realise you will be a bit groggy - all of us are - but resist the temptation to snooze."Your body will go back to sleep, but it will be very light, low-quality sleep."Instead the advice is to throw open the curtains and expose yourself to as much bright light as possible.Myth 6 - Snoring is always harmless Snoring can be harmless, but it can also be a sign of the disorder sleep apnoea.This causes the walls of the throat to relax and narrow during sleep, and can briefly stop people breathing.People with the condition are more likely to develop high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat and have a heart attack or a stroke.One of the warning signs is loud snoring.NHS: Obstructive sleep apnoea Dr Robbins concludes: "Sleep is one of the most important things we can all do tonight to improve our health, our mood, our wellbeing and our longevity."Follow James on Twitter
Artificial gravity tests could reduce muscle loss, say researchers:::::Image copyright EPA/SASCHA STEINBACH Image caption Twelve men and twelve women volunteers will take part in the research A machine which simulates the effects of gravity could reduce muscle wastage for patients in hospitals as well as astronauts on long missions.Tests will explore what happens when volunteers are spun daily on a human centrifuge after 60 days of bed rest.It is hoped the technique will speed up patient recovery and lessen the impact on future space flights.The research in Manchester and Newcastle is backed by the UK Space Agency.Image copyright EPA/SASCHA STEINBACH Image caption The research could also help astronauts who are sent on long missions Professor Hans Degens, who is leading the work at Manchester Metropolitan University, said: "Artificial gravity could help astronauts to maintain muscle mass in space and help back here on Earth too by preventing severe muscle degeneration in hospitalised patients."Currently astronauts have to exercise for up to 2.5 hours every day, take nutrient supplements, and keep high protein diets to maintain muscle mass while they are in space.Despite this, severe muscle deterioration still occurs."One day, astronauts might have a daily quick spin in a centrifuge on the ISS [International Space Station] rather than spend hours on gym equipment in space."For hospital patients it could greatly improve their recovery during rehabilitation and after they leave."The research is backed by the UK Space Agency with 500,000 awarded to Northumbria University and Manchester Metropolitan University.Twelve men and twelve women volunteers will be subjected to 60 days of bed rest, simulating the long-term effects of weightlessness.Some of the group will spend 30 minutes every day lying flat in the human centrifuge as it spins and researchers will examine muscle degeneration.
Free sanitary products plan extended to primary girls:::::Free sanitary products will be offered to girls in all primary schools in England from early 2020.It follows Chancellor Philip Hammond's announcement last month of funding for free sanitary products in secondary schools and colleges.Amika George, founder of the #FreePeriods campaign, called the latest move "fantastic news".Children and families minister Nadhim Zahawi said: "No-one should be held back from reaching their potential".When Mr Hammond made the original announcement in his Spring Statement last month campaigners argued that it should also include primary schools."We're so glad that the government has extended this pledge to primary schools," said Ms George, 19, a student at Cambridge University."Period poverty should never be a barrier to education."The next tampon She said it meant that every student could go to school without "worrying where their next pad or tampon will come from" and could "fully participate in lessons and focus in class".Ms George began campaigning two years ago, while still at school, after reading about period poverty in the news.She described herself at the time as "shocked" to find out girls were missing school because of not having sanitary products.Image copyright The Pink Protest Image caption Amika George started campaigning on period poverty when she was 17 years old The campaign began with a petition and a protest outside Downing Street and this year Ms George helped spearhead a legal campaign, in conjunction with the Red Box Project and The Pink Protest.Girlguiding says its own research has suggested almost a third of 11 to 21-year-old girls and young women have missed school or college because of their period.Isla, also 19, and a member of Girlguiding's panel of advocates, called the figures "unacceptable", adding that "giving primary school girls access to tampons and pads will help break the taboo of periods from a young age".A Department for Education spokesman said officials would begin talking to school and college leaders on the quantities of sanitary products likely to be needed from early next year, and how best to deliver them.He said they were likely to be bought in bulk and distributed locally.Mr Zahawi added: "After speaking to parents, teachers and pupils, we are now extending this to more than 20,000 primary schools so that every young person in all our schools and colleges gets the support they need."
Clampdown planned for British online pharmacies:::::Image caption Debbie Headspeath bought codeine from online pharmacies New rules to keep people safe when buying medications from online pharmacies have been described as a "big step forward" by Britain's pharmacy regulator.It comes after patients and relatives raised concerns, as well as an investigation by BBC Panorama.The General Pharmaceutical Council has issued guidance for providers.It will help regulate access to addictive medication, such as strong painkillers.Duncan Rudkin, the General Pharmaceutical Council's chief executive, told the BBC that he hoped the new rules would "make an important difference to improving standards of safety and care for patients".The way some online pharmacy websites operate will change, and more checks will be done on medications.Extra safety measures include: Sites cannot be set up in a way that allows patients to choose a prescription-only medication before an online consultation with a healthcare professional More safeguards will be introduced for certain medications, including antibiotics and medicines that need ongoing monitoring or management For medications that are liable to abuse, overuse or misuse, or when there is a risk of addiction, the prescriber needs to contact the GP in advance of issuing the prescription (and they have confirmed it is appropriate for the patient and the appropriate monitoring is in place) Online pharmacy websites should be clear about the identity and/or location of the pharmacies issuing prescriptions Mr Rudkin said the Panorama programme "was really helpful in shining a light on a really important area of public safety".It revealed how easy it was for patients to buy drugs online that their own GPs would be highly unlikely to prescribe.Patients contacted Panorama after the programme.Image caption Kevin Duggan said his sister had been exploited Debbie Headspeath, 41, died in 2017 in Ipswich.Her brother, Kevin Duggan told the BBC that after her death, they found on bank statements that she had bought codeine from 18 online UK pharmacies.Debbie had started a new job with war veterans and, despite waking up with stomach pains, she did not want to miss work."She put her jacket and bag on and then collapsed by the front door.She wasn't found until several hours later when her partner came home from work and it was too late and she had gone.She died."Debbie had been prescribed the opiate-based painkiller dihydrocodeine by her family doctor in 2008 after developing back pain.After several years, it was recognised she was addicted.The family doctor tried to wean her off, but she was able to secretly buy medication, prescribed by doctors and dispensed by UK pharmacies, without her GP being informed by the companies.Kevin said: "There's no justification for what they do, which is exploiting people with an addiction.I would like to invite the companies to try and justify their actions to my mum."To look my mum in the eyes and explain why they allowed this to happen."The inquest, which will decide the cause of death, is next month, but her brother told the BBC he felt the codeine had contributed to her death.Son born addicted Another relative of a patient contacted the BBC.His wife had developed back pain after the birth of their first child in 2014.In 2016, he realised she was addicted to dihydrocodeine - the same drug prescribed to Debbie - and asked her GP to help her get off them.In 2017, she found out she was pregnant again."I think when she fell pregnant she was taking 20 pills a day secretly."Then I think she realised, and then the midwife weaned her down to eight to 10 pills a day.And as a consequence of that, you know, my son was born addicted to opiates."To see your child in such distress, to see jerky movements; the shaking.It's something that I wouldn't want anybody to ever go through."His wife managed to come off the codeine, but she has recently relapsed.He says that, so far, the medications have cost them nearly 25,000.Mr Rudkin told the BBC: "I really want to acknowledge the pain that some families have experienced that's been associated in some cases with online pharmacies."It's really important that the stories help to change regulations.We've taken steps to address the risk."You can watch Panorama: Online Doctors Uncovered on BBC iPlayer.
Measles cases quadruple globally in 2019, says UN:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The World Health Organization says the latest figures paint "an alarming picture" The number of measles cases reported worldwide in the first three months of 2019 has quadrupled compared with the same time last year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).The UN body said provisional data indicated a "a clear trend", with all regions of the world seeing outbreaks.Africa had witnessed the most dramatic rise - up 700%.The agency said actual numbers may be far greater, since only one in 10 cases globally are reported.Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can sometimes lead to serious health complications, including infections of the lungs and brain.Ukraine, Madagascar and India have been worst affected by the disease, with tens of thousands of reported cases per million people.Since September, at least 800 people have died from measles in Madagascar alone.Outbreaks have also hit Brazil, Pakistan and Yemen, "causing many deaths - mostly among young children", while a spike in case numbers was reported for countries including the US and Thailand with high levels of vaccination coverage.In total, some 170 countries reported 112,163 measles cases to WHO, in comparison to 28,124 cases across 163 countries during the same period in 2018.The UN says the disease is "entirely preventable" with the right vaccines, but global coverage of the first immunisation stage has "stalled" at 85%, "still short of the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks".In an opinion piece for CNN, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and UNICEF head Henrietta Fore said the world was "in the middle of a measles crisis" and that "the proliferation of confusing and contradictory information" about vaccines was partly to blame.Why the sudden 'global measles crisis'?By James Gallagher, health and science correspondent, BBC News It is one of the most contagious viruses around.However, nothing about measles has changed.It has not mutated to become more infectious or more dangerous.Instead the answers are entirely human.There are two stories here - one of poverty and one of misinformation.In poorer countries fewer people are vaccinated and a larger portion of the population is left vulnerable to the virus.This creates the environment for a large outbreak to occur - such as those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kyrgyzstan and Madagascar.But rich countries with seemingly high vaccination rates are seeing cases spike too.This is because clusters of people are choosing not to vaccinate their children due to the spread of untrue anti-vax messages on social media.It is worth noting these figures are provisional, the WHO says the true figures will be much higher.And that measles is far from harmless.It kills around 100,000 people, mostly children, every year.The pair wrote that it was "understandable, in such a climate, how loving parents can feel lost" but that "ultimately, there is no 'debate' to be had about the profound benefits of vaccines".They added: "More than 20 million lives have been saved through measles vaccination since the year 2000 alone."In response to recent measles outbreaks, calls have mounted in several countries to make immunisation mandatory.Last month, Italy banned children under six from attending schools unless they had received vaccines for chickenpox, measles and other illnesses.A public health emergency has also been declared in areas of New York, ordering all residents to be vaccinated or face a fine.
Swansea boy's 'neck pain' was rare throat cancer:::::Image copyright Rhian John / Hook News Image caption McKenzie John is due to undergo proton beam therapy next month An eight-year-old boy who complained of neck pain while his mother washed his hair was diagnosed with a rare cancer.McKenzie John, from Swansea, is undergoing chemotherapy to treat a nasopharyngeal tumour.The youngster is being treated in Cardiff, where he is on his second of three rounds of chemotherapy.His mother Rhian John said: "I'm absolutely heartbroken.I never expected something like this to happen to us."The 35-year-old added: "It's a hell of a lot for an eight-year-old to cope with.McKenzie is in high spirits, but he has a long road ahead of him."The NHS health care support worker said her son first complained of a painful neck in November while showering.In January, a GP dismissed his symptoms as a viral infection.Ms John said: "He's always been a strong and healthy kid, and he never made a fuss or tried to skip school, so it was unusual for him to complain of this neck pain."Whenever he tried to tip his head back to wash his hair, he'd say it really hurt."Image copyright Rhian John / Hook News Image caption McKenzie's mother said he was "in high spirits" Various tests came back negative before an MRI scan in March revealed the tumour.McKenzie spent four days in an induced coma before being transferred to an oncology ward at the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, where he had emergency "adult doses" of chemotherapy.Mother-of-four Ms John said her son was "getting on with it"."McKenzie understands he has cancer, he lost all his hair after his first dose of chemo, but he's getting on with it, taking it in his stride."He is due to undergo proton beam therapy at The Christie NHS Foundation Trust in Manchester, which opened last year.About 250 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with the cancer, which affects the part of the throat connecting the mouth and the nose.A Go Fund Me page set up to help support the family's stay in Manchester has so far raised more than 4,000.
'The doctor wrote a question mark for my child's sex':::::When doctors wrote a question mark instead of a sex on her child's birth papers, Catherine filed a high court case that has prompted Kenya to start changing its approach to intersex children.The year is 2009.It's been five days since Catherine (not her real name) gave birth to her first child at the modest Nairobi home that she shares with her husband.But there's a problem."Something was off with my baby's body," she tells me.Catherine asks her neighbour to come and take a look.She points at her child's genitalia and the neighbour bends down.She looks silently.Without attempting to diagnose a condition, she tells Catherine not to worry.She assures her that her child will be fine.But Catherine wants a second opinion.This time she invites her cousin over."My cousin asked me what the problem was.I told her to just go ahead and check the baby."Catherine's cousin agrees that "something looks off".She advises her to visit the local hospital.The next day Catherine and her husband go to their local doctor, who immediately refers them to Kenyatta National Hospital, the largest in the country.The diagnosis from the hospital stuns the couple.Catherine and her husband are told that their child is born with an intersex condition.The baby possesses both male and female genitalia.In the paperwork where sex is to be marked, the doctor writes a question mark instead."After returning from Kenyatta with the doctor's report, that's when my husband started pulling back from me," says Catherine."He stopped leaving behind money for food."They began to fight.Catherine's husband would yell at her that his family had no history of children with both a penis and a vagina, so there was no way that the child could be his."He used to hurl insults at me, calling me a prostitute.I asked if the baby wasn't his where did the child come from?"Catherine says quietly."It is God who plans everything."Her husband refused to attend any future hospital appointments for the child.To Catherine it began to seem that she would be left to raise her intersex child singlehanded, and the prospect terrified her."I felt so alone and confused.One day I bought rat poison, so that I could kill myself and the baby.I mixed it in the meal.I remember it was beans."But she stopped herself at the last moment and ran to a church to speak to the pastor.He reassured her that she was not alone, that other children like hers do exist in the world - her child was not an aberration or a curse."He told me that life will go on.The Lord will bless me and my child and both of us would survive."Catherine made a decision.One month after their child was born, she left her husband and moved in with her sister and her family.She had been abused and shamed enough, and it wasn't the life she wanted for herself or her child.An intersex timeline 2013 The UN special rapporteur on torture says non-consensual "genital normalising surgery arguably meets the criteria for torture" 2015 Malta becomes the first country to ban non-consensual modifications to sex characteristics 2017 Human Rights Watch and interACT call for a moratorium on all safely deferrable surgical procedures on children with atypical sex characteristics 2018 Germany adopts intersex identity into law - people can register as intersex on birth certificates and passports from 1 January 2019 2019 a UK task force of NHS doctors and intersex activists is assembled to look into informed consent and surgery on children Weeks after giving birth, with no income coming in, Catherine returned to work at a children's home weighted with worry.One thing troubling her was the suggestion that her child should have corrective surgery."The doctor told me that the baby's male hormones were stronger than the female hormones and that we should have surgery to sew up the vagina and give male hormones."For a long time she resisted the idea, but just over a year after the birth, she gave consent, believing it would be in the best interest of her baby.She quickly came to regret it.The second issue was the birth certificate.In order to obtain a birth certificate in Kenya a sex needs to be assigned to the child, but Catherine only had the forms where hospital staff had put a question mark next to a box indicating sex.A question mark meant that a birth certificate could not be issued - and nor could an identity card or passport in Kenya.Catherine knew that without these documents, she could not enrol her child into school, and that as an adult her child would not be allowed to vote.Eventually she confided in a colleague at work.He told her that he knew a man that may be able to help her.That was when Catherine met John Chigiti.You may also be interested in: The midwife who saved intersex babies Now I have a penis, I hope I will find love Doctors hid secret from me Earlier in the same year, 2010, John Chigiti had become well-known in Kenya as the lawyer representing Richard Muasya, an intersex person who had been sexually harassed in a male prison.The court rejected Muasya's plea to move to a female prison, but Chigiti earned a reputation as someone sympathetic towards intersex people, in a country where public opinion is often hostile.The birth of children with intersex traits is often seen as a curse or bad omen on the family, with many killed in infancy.Catherine wanted three things, identity documents for her child to be able to attend school, a law preventing surgery on intersex children unless it is medically necessary and proper information and psychological support for parents.Chigiti agreed to represent her pro bono, and helped by a local NGO, The Cradle the Children Foundation, they filed a case with Kenya's High Court before the end of of the year.In order to protect her child's identity, Catherine called her child Baby A, so the case became known as Baby A v. Attorney General, Kenyatta National Hospital, and the Registrar of Births and Deaths.In a landmark ruling in 2014 the court ordered the government to issue a birth certificate to Catherine's five-year-old child.In addition, it ordered the Attorney General to create a task force that would look at ways of providing better support for intersex children.That task force handed in its recommendations to the Attorney General this week.Its recommendations include delaying surgery until children can choose for themselves and a robust survey on the number of intersex people in Kenya."Another strong recommendation is to have an 'I-marker' an intersex marker to be put into public documentation," says Mbage Ng'ang'a, the Chair of the Kenya Law Reform Commission who headed the taskforce, "as opposed to the binary state where we only recognise male and female in our official documentation."A number of countries recognise a third gender that can be registered on official documents once someone's gender identity becomes clear.The task force's plan is different - it's about sex rather than gender, and will register children as intersex at birth.Mbage Ng'ang'a says parliamentarians have shown strong support for the recommendations and that 2019 will bring major changes for the rights of intersex people.The case of Baby A inspired this, he says.These days Catherine survives by making and selling soap.Her immediate family and friends are aware of Baby A's medical history.They support her.Some days she doesn't make any sales."But we get by," she says.Catherine has raised Baby A, now almost 10, as a boy.She wonders if it was the right decision.Baby A doesn't seem comfortable as a boy, she says, but she hasn't asked him how he identifies.She worries that he's a loner."He does not like company, you will not find him with other kids," she says.She has a message for parents."If you have an intersex child, leave them alone and let them decide (on surgery) for themselves when they grow up."Even medical advice, she says, needs to based on research, not the doctor's instinct, or prejudice."Doctors are not gods."Illustrations by Rebecca Hendin The story of Baby A also features in this video report by Megha Mohan published in January: All over the world, children with intersex traits are being operated on to be sex-assigned at birth - sometimes with devastating consequences.Megha Mohan explores the hidden world of intersex children.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Intersex surgeries: is it right to assign sex to a baby?Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.
'My son killed himself after circumcision':::::Image copyright Lesley Roberts Image caption Alex Hardy sent his mum Lesley Roberts an email explaining his decision "It quickly became apparent that what had just happened was a catastrophe...I died in 2015, not now."Lesley Roberts was stunned as she read the devastating final email from her beloved son Alex Hardy.The email had been timed to arrive on 25 November 2017, 12 hours after he killed himself.Less than an hour before the email arrived, Lesley had opened her front door to find a police officer standing there, explaining her son was dead.Alex was an intelligent and popular 23-year-old with no history of mental illness.Lesley could not understand why he would have wanted to take his own life.His email explained how the foreskin of his penis had been surgically removed two years before.This is commonly known as circumcision, but Alex had come to believe it should be regarded as "male genital mutilation".He never mentioned this to his family or friends when he was alive.Lesley did not even know her son had been circumcised.In the following months, she tried to find out more about circumcision.Why had it affected Alex so badly, and why did he feel killing himself was his only option?Image copyright Lesley Roberts Image caption Lesley says her "dreams came true" when she became a mother in July 1994 Alex was the eldest of Lesley's three sons and had been very much longed for, having been conceived after fertility treatment.Lesley says her "dreams came true" when she became a mother in July 1994."He was everything I could have wished for," she says."Gorgeous, easygoing, and adoring of his younger brother Thomas who arrived following more treatment almost three years later."He also adored his baby brother James, who was born when Alex was 13.The walls and windowsills of Lesley's home in Cheshire are covered in photos of all of them.Alex sailed through his education and was particularly gifted at English, so much so that his old school established the Alex Hardy Creative Writing Award in his memory."Alex was passionate about history but as his English teacher I saw in him a true talent for writing," says Jason Lowe, who is now head teacher at Tarporley High School.Image copyright Lesley Roberts Image caption Alex was intelligent and sailed through school It was while on a school skiing trip to Canada, aged 14, that Alex fell in love with the country.He had enjoyed skiing as a child and the trip reignited his passion.So, when Alex reached 18, he decided to defer university and live in Canada for a year."He fell in love completely with Canada and made so many friends and got a promotion at work," says Lesley."After one year he rang me and said 'Mum, I'm deferring my place for university'.The same thing happened after year two."Two years turned into three, then four, and by the time of his death Alex had been living in Canada for five years and had obtained residency."He was known as the 'super-smart Brit' with impeccable manners," says his mother."The super-intelligent guy from the UK who helped people with their Canadian residency applications."Image copyright Lesley Roberts Image caption Alex was a keen skier and snowboarder, but he found physical activity painful after being circumcised Lesley visited her son several times, both alone and with his brothers and stepfather.They were a close family, but Alex did not tell any of them he was secretly suffering with a problem with his penis."I had issues with a tight foreskin," he eventually wrote in his final email, "but from my late teens it created issues in the bedroom as it meant my foreskin would not retract over the glans as intended which caused some awkward moments."In 2015, still silently suffering, Alex consulted a doctor in Canada.He was given steroid cream to stretch his foreskin, but went back to the doctor after just a few weeks because he did not think the treatment was working.The medical name for Alex's problem is phimosis.It simply means his foreskin was too tight to pull back from the head of his penis, or the "glans" as Alex referred to it in his email.This is perfectly normal for boys in the early years of their life.As boys get older, their foreskin usually starts to separate from the head of the penis.Image caption Lesley says Alex was "intuitive, empathetic, gentle, kind, witty, quirky, unassuming and caring" Phimosis does not always cause problems, but if it does, problems can include difficulty urinating and pain during sex.In England, the NHS advises topical steroids and stretching techniques - and circumcision as a last resort.Over in Canada, where circumcision is more common, Alex was referred to a urologist."He immediately suggested circumcision," Alex wrote."I asked about stretching and he completely lied to my face and said it would not work for me."I was mostly trusting as I felt he was the expert who knew best in this regard so with a pinch of salt I accepted it."Lesley has since read online reviews of this urologist which have made her question his competence.One patient said she had been unable to work since having surgery for kidney problems, and he had "destroyed" her quality of life."I'm a mother of three young children who are scared every day I will die as they see me suffering in so much pain," she wrote."I can see how he misdiagnosed others, botched surgeries, and ruined lives," said another review."He's dangerously incompetent."Another review of Alex's urologist read: "They left a surgical instrument in my bladder but I only got notified three months later.Run away before you get hurt!"Image copyright Lesley Roberts Image caption Lesley says she misses Alex's "big sparkly eyes, his grin, his sense of humour, and his bear hugs" Lesley, who was "horrified" by these reviews, has asked for the urologist to be investigated.She has been told an inquiry is ongoing.The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia told the BBC it "cannot disclose the existence of a complaint against a physician, and only may do so if the complaint leads to formal discipline"."I will wish with my last breath and with all of heart that my darling son had run away," says Lesley.Much to his regret, Alex was not able to research the urologist - or circumcision - properly at the time because his laptop was broken.He had tried researching the topic in a public computer space but felt uncomfortable, and also felt it was "too much of a taboo" to discuss with friends.So Alex booked what he believed was a minor procedure and had the surgery in 2015, at the age of 21.Image copyright Lesley Roberts Image caption Alex "adored" his little brother In the email to his mother, Alex explained, in great detail, the physical problems he had suffered afterwards.He described experiencing constant stimulation from the head of his penis, which was no longer protected by his foreskin."These ever-present stimulated sensations from clothing friction are torture within themselves; they have not subsided/normalised from years of exposure," he wrote."Imagine what would happen to an eyeball if the eyelid was amputated?""He was in so much pain that it hurt to do normal physical activity," says Lesley."He was a keen skier and snowboarder so you can imagine the pain he was in."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The foreskin protects the head of the penis, known as the glans Consultant urological surgeon Trevor Dorkin, who is a member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons, advises his patients that the head of their penis will be more sensitive after circumcision.However, this sensitivity usually reduces."I always say to guys 'it's going to feel more sensitive to start with' because all of a sudden you haven't got this protection over the head of the penis and it will feel different," says Mr Dorkin, who has carried out more than 1,000 circumcisions."But in the vast majority of the cases the man adjusts to that, the brain adjusts to that, it adjusts to the signals that are coming back through the nerves from the head of the penis."You might also be interested in: Alex also wrote about experiencing erectile dysfunction, and burning and itching sensations, particularly from a scar which sat where his frenulum was removed.The frenulum is a band of tissue where the foreskin attaches to the under surface of the penis.Some men refer to it as their "banjo string"."It's one of the more erogenous zones so it's thought to be important in sexual function," says Mr Dorkin."The foreskin, the head of the penis and the frenulum is a very, very sensitive area."But again when you do circumcision sometimes the frenulum is not preserved and it doesn't necessarily have an effect on overall sexual function and enjoyment."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A growing movement regards male circumcision as male genital mutilation But Alex felt his frenulum had been important."Through its absence I can certainly verify it is the most erogenously sensitive area of the penis and male body overall," he wrote."If someone were to amputate your clitoris you may begin to be able to understand how this feels."He wrote about experiencing cramps and contractions in his muscles and "uncomfortable" sensations which extended deep into his abdomen.Lesley does not know whether or not Alex had sex after his circumcision."Where I once had a sexual organ I have now been left with a numb, botched stick," he wrote."My sexuality has been left in tatters."He asked: "Nature knows best - how can chopping off a section of healthy tissue improve nature's evolved design?"Image caption Lesley did not know her son had been circumcised until he died Like many people, Lesley admits she knew very little about the foreskin or circumcision before her son died."I didn't know anything apart from I believed it was a very routine surgery," she says.The foreskin is sometimes dismissed as a "useless flap of skin", but Mr Dorkin says it does have a purpose."It covers the head of the penis," he says."In terms of what's it for, it provides a bit of protection to the head of the penis.It's thought to have some sort of immunological function perhaps."Circumcision rates vary a lot depending on where you are in the world and which culture you grew up in.According to the World Health Organization, 95% of men are circumcised in Nigeria but only 8.5% of men in the UK are.Most of the men circumcised in the UK are either Muslim or Jewish, as circumcision is regarded as an important part of their religions.According to the 2011 census, Muslims accounted for 4.8% of the population in England and Wales, while 0.5% were Jewish.People who question circumcision are sometimes accused of being anti-Semitic or Islamophobic, but Lesley stresses her son was neither."For me, this has nothing to do with religion at all.I respect all people of faith or indeed no faith, as Alex did," she says.In Canada, where Alex had moved to, an estimated 32% of men are circumcised.Alex felt male circumcision has been normalised to the extent that most people do not question it, while female circumcision has become known as female genital mutilation (FGM) and is now illegal in many countries.Image caption Alex was the eldest of Lesley's three sons He felt male circumcision should be known as "male genital mutilation" - a view shared by a growing anti-circumcision movement."If I were a female (in Western nations) this would have been illegal, the surgeon would be a criminal and this would never have been considered as an option by doctors," Alex wrote."I do not believe in championing one gender over another but I feel strongly that gender equality should be achieved for all."Campaigners for "genital autonomy" believe it is wrong to circumcise a baby or child - whether they are male or female - because the patient cannot give consent, and these campaigners regard circumcision as a human rights issue.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Campaigners for "genital autonomy" argue that circumcising a baby is wrong because an infant cannot consent Having lived with an intact penis for 21 years, Alex believed men circumcised as babies or young children would "tragically never be able to fully comprehend what has been taken away".He estimated he had been stripped of 75% of the sensitivity of his penis.However, experiences of men circumcised as adults differ dramatically.Some men actually prefer sex afterwards because they no longer have the pain of a tight or inflamed foreskin.Some report a significant loss in sensitivity and greatly reduced sexual pleasure.Some report being less sensitive but say there is no change in their overall enjoyment of sex.Some are very happy with their decision to get circumcised.Some, like Alex, deeply regret having it done.Image copyright Lesley Roberts Image caption Alex went whale watching with his mother for his 21st birthday Alex sought further medical help following the circumcision as well as psychological help, but never shared his problems with his family or friends."I was with him during those two years and I think I would be lying if I said I didn't think something wasn't right," says Lesley."I did say 'Is something bothering you?Are you OK?'and he would absolutely reassure me that he was."Lesley, who used to be a teacher, now hopes to go into schools and speak to young men about sharing their problems, even if they are very personal."I think we all know that men don't particularly tend to talk about their problems in the same way that girls do but I think circumcision is very much a taboo subject," she says."Alex was reserved.He certainly wouldn't have said 'I've got a tight foreskin and it really hurts'.And he didn't.And I didn't know."Only a week after Alex died, a friend opened up to Lesley about his own circumcision."He told me he wouldn't normally have mentioned it but he had a circumcision as an older man, 10 years ago, and he was in constant daily pain," says Lesley."It just seems it's more common than you think."Image caption Consultant urological surgeon Trevor Dorkin, who is a member of the British Association of Urological Surgeons, warns his patients of risks before circumcising them Mr Dorkin says serious problems following a circumcision are rare, but not unheard of."You do hear of horror stories where a circumcision has been done poorly and there's damage done to the head of the penis itself," he says.Sometimes too much skin is taken and this can result in what's known as "burying" or shortening of the penis, where it gets pulled back into the body."Surgeons at the end of the day are human and there is potential for human error and technical error during any operation," he says."One of my mentors told me every case is a tricky case, that's got to be your approach to surgery.You never take anything for granted in surgery."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Adult men have died from ritual circumcisions in South Africa There have been cases of children and men dying after being circumcised.Four-week-old Goodluck Caubergs bled to death after a nurse circumcised him at his home in Manchester, while one-month-old Angelo Ofori-Mintah bled to death after being circumcised.Since 1995 at least 1,100 boys have died in South Africa after ritual circumcisions.Some penises fall off after becoming infected and rotten, while some have to be amputated.In Canada, where Alex was living, newborn baby Ryan Heydari bled to death after being circumcised by a doctor in Ontario.Recently there have been reports of two babies dying within weeks of each other after home circumcisions in Italy, and a two-year-old boy died after being circumcised at a migrant centre in Italy.Image

isn't," says Lesley."It certainly was in my son's case and I think we need more research.We need to look into the risks, what can really go wrong, and we need to be more aware of them."If a circumcision is necessary, Mr Dorkin says it is important to tell patients about potential complications."Particularly when you are doing the operation in a guy who is in his late teenage years or early adulthood, it's a very sensitive area and sexual function is important, so you have to explain the risks to them," he says.Image copyright Lesley Roberts Image caption Alex asked his mother to share his story after he died "Alex said he was not made aware of all the risks," says Lesley."If he had, I feel sure he would not have had the surgery."Alex wasn't alone.I now know he wasn't the only one that this has happened to.And that can't be right."The UK charity 15 Square, which tries to educate people about circumcision, says Alex is not the only man to have killed himself after being circumcised."It happens more frequently than people realise," says chairman David Smith.There are no statistics on men who have killed themselves after being circumcised.Alex died over a year ago but his story has not been told until now.An inquest into his death was held in the UK but it was not reported by the media.Lesley, who is normally private and reserved like her son, only agreed to share Alex's story because it was his dying wish."If the following information can benefit anybody then it has served its purpose," he wrote."I did not feel comfortable raising the issue when I had a choice, so if my story can raise awareness to break this taboo within society regarding men's health then I am happy for release of my words."Alex said in his letter 'We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us'," says Lesley."This is the last thing I'm doing for my precious son."For details of organisations which offer advice and support, go to BBC Action Line.
'I helped test a wonder drug - then I was denied it':::::Because of rare illness, Louise Moorhouse is on a special diet of pills or foul-tasting shakes.There's a drug that would allow her to eat like anyone else - she took it for three years during a clinical trial.But the NHS won't pay for it, reports the BBC's Deborah Cohen - and the drug company stopped giving it to her once the trial was over.Imagine having to take more than 80 pills a day or drink shakes to replace everyday foods you can't eat.That's the reality for Louise Moorhouse, a 35-year-old teacher from Birmingham, who has a rare genetic condition called phenylketonuria or PKU.The pills are "huge", she says."They're quite tricky to swallow.I think the most I have managed to do in one go is four.Any more than that and they come out my nose."The shakes are preferable, but attempts to give them a fruity taste have not succeeded in masking their "stomach-turning" acidity.From time to time her stomach starts to reject them, Louise says.In which case, she goes back on the pills.People with PKU can't properly digest the amino acid phenylalanine.Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and are broken down by the body to make our own proteins.But in people with PKU the levels build up, and can cause brain damage.Louise says she has to completely avoid 80% of normal food, and the protein in her diet has to be severely restricted - which may mean weighing it on scales before eating it."I basically live on fruits and vegetables," she says.Dinner dates are best avoided, she has learned."I avoid socialising with food if there's people there who I don't know," Louise says."They may notice that sometimes I have to get my scales out and sometimes I have to send food back or it takes me a long time to choose food."But for three years, in her early 20s, Louise was able to eat like anyone else.That's because she took part in trials for a drug now called Kuvan (sapropterin hydrochloride) that was being developed by US biotech company, BioMarin.Find out more Watch Deborah Cohen's report on Newsnight, on BBC Two, on Tuesday 16 April 2019 "I took part in the trial because I just thought, 'Wow, if this works it's just going to change lives,'" she says.And for Louise it did."Kuvan allowed me to eat a completely normal diet.And it was it was almost like someone had opened curtains on my life and I could see everything in Technicolor," she says."It just freed me up so much."The dietician who had treated Louise as a child, Prof Anita MacDonald of Birmingham Children's Hospital, was one of the scientists involved.With help from her and Louise, BioMarin gathered enough evidence to show Kuvan reduced the levels of phenylalanine in many people with PKU.In 2007, it became the only licensed drug for the condition in the US; its European licence followed in 2008.Image caption Prof Anita MacDonald: The NHS said No "Because the trial had gone so well and because it made such a difference, I was convinced that it would only be a matter of time before this drug - that we had proved worked - would be available to everyone who responded to it," Louise says.But for NHS patients it wasn't.BioMarin put a 70,000 price tag on it, per adult per year - and the NHS thought it wasn't worth that."The drug was too expensive and the NHS decided that there wasn't enough evidence of efficacy of that drug at that time and so they said no to prescribing it," says Anita MacDonald.It was a blow for Louise, who had to return to the pills and shakes."It was a massive shock to my system," she says."I had to relearn almost everything.It had a massive effect on my concentration, my mood, my focus at work, my relationship."The hope of an effective treatment for PKU had appeared on the horizon in the 1990s.A simple compound developed in a Swiss laboratory had been found to enable people with PKU to digest phenylalanine.It was then researched with public money and used unlicensed by many doctors.The trouble was, PKU is quite a rare disease.In England it is estimated that between one in 10,000 and one in 14,000 people have PKU.So there was little financial incentive for a pharmaceutical company to turn the compound into a licensed drug.Then in 2000, the European Commission introduced incentives to encourage the production of "orphan drugs" for people with rare conditions, ruling that companies would enjoy up to 12 years of market exclusivity.The cost of orphan drugs According to Dyfrig Hughes, professor of pharmacoeconomics at Bangor University, more than 165 orphan drugs have now been approved - and that in fact 50% of all drugs approved last year were for rare diseases.Companies find them profitable.But critics say the profitability - and the high price - of orphan drugs does not reflect the amount of effort companies have had to make to generate them."We did one piece of work where we identified that 40% of orphan drugs are actually repurposed.That is they've been previously used for other purposes before they were granted orphan status," Dyfrig Hughes says.With governments across Europe struggling with the price of drugs used to treat rare conditions, the BBC is aware that the European Commission is reviewing the incentives scheme.In 2004, BioMarin - which specialises in drugs for rare conditions - bought the data from the early development of the compound to treat PKU.This meant that while it had to fund trials it didn't have to meet the costs of searching for an entirely novel chemical compound.When Kuvan was licensed a few years later and the NHS refused to pay the hefty price, patients were stuck in the middle.This remains the case, even now that the NHS has come to recognise the efficacy of the drug."BioMarin have been asked to drop the price on many occasions but at the moment they have a patent," Anita Macdonald says."They've got no competition."BioMarin told the BBC the NHS has asked for an 80% discount."BioMarin is disappointed that the NHS England has not recognised the value of treating PKU patients with Kuvan, despite more than a decade of positive patient outcomes across 26 countries in Europe, Russia and Turkey," a spokesperson said.An NHS England spokesperson said: "The NHS does not offer a blank cheque to pharmaceutical companies, instead the NHS works hard to strike deals which give people access to the most clinically effective and innovative medicines, and at a price which is fair and affordable, which is exactly what our patients and the country's taxpayers would expect us to do."Most disappointed by the outcome were the people like Louise, who had taken part in the trial and identified Kuvan as what Louise calls "the holy grail for us".The BBC is aware of seven others."You want your patients to gain any benefit from the work that they've done.They've entered the trial in good heart.We as scientists enter the trial in good heart," says Anita Macdonald."I don't think it is ethical for patients to be involved in a trial and not continue with a treatment.Those patients put a lot of trust in the drug company and it's the least that could have been done for them to continue with that treatment longer term."Indeed, there is a global medical ethics agreement for research, called the Declaration of Helsinki, which says provisions should be made "for all participants who still need an intervention identified as beneficial in the trial".When the BBC pointed this out to BioMarin, the company said: "To the best of our knowledge, BioMarin is treating all known ex-trial patients.If there are any ex-trial patients who are not being treated and would like to be treated, they should talk to their treating physician and apply for treatment."For Louise, who for 10 years since the end of the trial has had to maintain her diet of pills or shakes, this came as startling news.She burst into tears.It had taken her years to conceive because of the difficulty getting her blood levels of phenylalanine down, she said."A lot has happened that didn't have to happen.All these years I could have been on Kuvan and I wouldn't have had so many issues."I feel so emotional - it's like winning the lottery."You may also be interested in: British teenager Shauna Davison was given an experimental transplant in 2012, in the hope of prolonging her life.Her mother says she was told in advance about two patients who had survived a similar operation -

Stoma bags: Bin rules 'can add to house share struggles':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amber has a stoma after having her bowel removed Piles of washing up, trying to squash all your rubbish in one bin and sharing a bathroom is all part of living in a shared house.But for people living with medical conditions these things can be more than a headache.Amber Davies, 21, has a stoma after having her bowel removed after developing ulcerative colitis.She loves living with her friends but worries about bin collections as there are strict rules in place.With services varying across Wales and some councils fining residents who throw too much away, there are calls for greater support to make life easier for those with medical conditions living away from home."We only get one black bin every two weeks, and I am responsible for filling up most of that," said product design student Amber, who changes her ostomy bag daily, but gets no extra allowance from Cardiff council despite living with three other people."To a shared house, one bin is not a lot at all, I know when I am back at home the council are a lot more lenient with what you are allowed, but here if the bin is open or over spilling then they won't take any of it, that then leads to problems."Image copyright LubJoi and Ilus Photography Image caption Amber now shares her life with others on social media to try and help people with IBD A stoma is an opening in the stomach where faeces are collected in a bag after part or all of the bowel is removed due to a disease or obstruction.Many people with ileostomies, where the large colon has been removed, have bags which can be emptied but need to be changed.But while the number of stoma bags prescribed in Wales almost trebled in the last 18 years, how the used bags are collected differs depending on where you live.Currently, six councils in Wales collect the bags in special absorbent hygiene collections, while the rest tell people to put the used appliances in household bins, collected about every two weeks.Image copyright Amber Davies Image caption Amber has hiked up mountains, jumped out of a plane and is now planning to run a 10km race through the streets of London with her ostomy bag on show It is not collected by the NHS as it is not classed as "clinical waste", such as needles and infectious waste.And rules differ for large households, with some areas allowing large families or people living in house shares to put out extra rubbish, while others have strict limits and can fine those who put out extra bags.In Cardiff the council allows extra rubbish for people living in houses with six or more people, if they can prove they recycle properly.@amberostomy Having a stoma is a big thing to adapt to live with, but generally life since surgery is a lot better and I can do so much more.Amber, from Builth Wells, Powys, was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis - one of the main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) - when she was 13.After years of trying medications and being in and out of hospital, when she was 17 she had emergency surgery to remove part of her diseased large bowel, leaving her with a stoma.Not long after her second operation - which removed the rest of her colon leaving her with a permanent bag - she moved away from home for the first time to go to Cardiff Metropolitan University.Amber moved into a house with eight other students."It was quite daunting to start, but I am quite open and honest with people about my disease and my bag, so I made sure everyone I lived with was in the know," she said.Image copyright LuvJoi Image caption Amber said the majority of comments on social media were supportive Now in her second year, she lives in a house share with three of the girls who know everything about her illness.Loving life since her surgery, she has jumped out of a plane, is training for a half marathon, and even does swimwear shoots and is a role model on Instagram for others who need or have an ostomy to break down barriers.But she still worries about filling up the bin with her used bags, which she changes every day, or has to change if they leak, as they only get one bin collection every two weeks Image copyright @amberostomy Image caption Amber shortly after her operation to remove her large bowel Amber said it would be really hard if she was not so open about her condition."For some people it could pose really big problems, but I have always been honest from day dot with the people I live with, which has made it easier," she said.Wayne Lewis, project manager for Crohn's and Colitis UK in Wales, said the challenges of living with a stoma were different for each person and that more support was needed to help people."If you are a student and you are moving away, you are getting to know who you are, you are trying to make new friends, and you don't want to stand out from the crowd," he said."If you've got a stoma and you've got to dispose of the waste, that's a difficult thing at that age to come to terms with sometimes."Image copyright @amberostomy Image caption Amber said while there is no cure for Ulcerative Colitis she now embraces every opportunity The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), which represents local councils, said while arrangements varied across Wales people with medical conditions could contact their council to discuss individual needs."Many councils have relaxations or exemptions available to cater for residents with specific medical needs," a spokesman said.A Cardiff council spokesman said if anybody living in a shared house was struggling with full bins, they could request a larger one."We will then come out to do an assessment to come up with a solution," a spokesman added.
Is it really worth injecting vitamins?:::::Image copyright Getty Images There is a growing trend for intravenous "vitamin" drips - but what are the risks?And do they even work?Last month, a 51-year-old woman from Hunan, China, nearly died after blending 20 different fruits to create a homemade intravenous (IV) drip.She thought vitamins from the fresh fruit would benefit her health.Instead, she developed a fever and itchiness, and was taken into intensive care with multiple organ damage.After dialysis, and several rounds of antibiotics, she is now recovering.This is an extreme example, but she may have been inspired by the growing trend for IV in which vitamins and other substances are administered directly into the blood.The practice is very popular in Asia where IV drips are offered in beauty salons, often by unlicensed and unqualified practitioners.Those promoting vitamin IV drips claim they can boost energy, strengthen the immune system, improve skin, cure hangovers, burn fat, fight jet lag, and cure a myriad of other minor ailments.In the US, a bus will even come to your house to offer infusions as part of a party package, to "cure" hangovers.Treatments can be very expensive, costing anything from 120 to 3,000 in one London clinic.Celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, Cara Delevingne and Chrissy Teigen have taken part in the growing trend, posting images of themselves on social media hooked up to IV bags."The treatments are increasingly popular, particularly as a quick fix or hangover cure - but there is no evidence of benefits and they can potentially be dangerous," says Marcela Fiuza, from the British Dietetic Association."Within a medical setting, we would never infuse anything intravenously, unless we absolutely had to," says Sophie Medlin, who used to work as a clinical dietitian and as a lecturer in nutrition and dietetics at King's College London."There is simply no medical justification for administering nutrition intravenously in any case other than intestinal failure, because it is so high risk."Typically, in a medical setting, a patient who has anything injected intravenously would have a thorough medical history taken.Infusion of vitamins potentially puts the liver and kidneys under stress, and to go ahead without screening the liver and kidney function first is prohibited by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the UK."That kind of provision is not being taken in most of the clinics I've seen practising intravenous vitamin drips," says Ms Medlin.Image copyright Getty Images What is in the bag of fluid varies around the world.In Taipei, customers can receive a menu to choose what kind of vitamins they want to include.In New Delhi, customers can pick between drips called "Basic" or "Thirsty" if for hydration, or treatments for skin called "Woke" or "Lit".There is even a drip named "Magic Markle" after the Duchess of Sussex.In London, along with detox and beauty drips, one outlet offers mood boosts.To boost their chances in university entrance exams, high school students in Hubei, China, were photographed hooking themselves up to intravenous vitamin drips.The image went viral, and the school claimed that the students had volunteered to take amino acids.As the school's infirmary became too full with the demand, the students took the IVs to the classroom where they could continue to study.Ms Medlin is shocked by this - she says that IVs should never be administered outside a carefully-controlled clinical environment."Any time you put anything into your body intravenously, you're running the risk of infection from the site where it's entered your bloodstream," she says.And why risk possible infection when our gut is excellent at absorbing the vitamins and minerals we need?For most people, a healthy balanced diet (and in some cases an oral vitamin supplement) is sufficient to provide all vitamins you need, says Ms Fuiza.Using IV drips mean that "people could be unknowingly receiving excessive amounts of nutrients which may have health implications, particularly for those having it regularly and people with background health conditions (known or unknown)", she warns.Who needs vitamin supplements?Certain groups at risk of deficiencies should use supplements: All pregnant and breastfeeding women should take vitamin D supplements Women trying to conceive and women in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy are recommended to take folic acid supplements, which reduce their child's risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida People aged 65 and over should take vitamin D supplements People with darker skin and people who are not exposed to much sun should take vitamin D supplements All children aged six months to five years should be given a supplement containing vitamins A, C and D Your doctor may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition If you fall outside these groups and buy vitamin pills then the chances are that you will be spending your money on surplus amounts of vitamins you have already gained through your diet Source: NHS Choices: Supplements, who needs them?Lisa Rogers, from the World Health Organization, thinks that people are being overzealous in their ingestion of extra vitamins."They think that it will give them a certain advantage.People only need vitamins in tiny amounts and only in the case of having a deficiency is it worth considering taking extra supplements," she says.Force-feeding vitamins into the veins via a drip could even put people at risk of a potential overdose, warns Ms Medlin."IV drips push vitamins into our bloodstream in a force-fed way.We will probably just excrete at least 90% of what's being infused in, so actually the benefits are very minimal, if any at all, and the risks massively outweigh the benefits," she says.Even if no complications arise from injecting the vitamin drips, Ms Medlin says that ultimately, "You are just making very expensive urine.It is literally money down the toilet."Listen to The Inquiry: How did we get hooked on vitamins?from BBC World Service on BBC Sounds.
How we became part of a kidney swap chain:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The Edinburgh couple who are part of a kidney transplant chain When Mandy Murray found out she needed a new kidney her husband Graham volunteered to be a donor but was told he was not a match.Instead the couple became part of a kidney swap chain, which is allowing more people to find live donors.Mandy first needed a kidney transplant about 19 years ago.Because her husband was not compatible, Mandy had to wait until a suitable donation became available from a deceased donor.She considers herself lucky to have got a phone call in the middle of the night and been rushed to hospital to receive the donor kidney.Many people are not so fortunate.Last year, 26 people in Scotland died while waiting for a kidney transplant.Image caption Mandy Graham had a kidney transplant from a deceased donor 19 years ago When a person needs a new kidney they first turn to family and friends to find a living donor.Doctors says patients who have a living kidney transplant tend to live longer and feel better than those who receive kidneys from a deceased donor.Mandy's new kidney allowed her to function for 18 years but it has recently started to decline and she was told she would need another transplant.Her husband Graham was tested again but was still not a match.Image caption Mandy's husband Graham was not a potential donor match for his wife However, Mandy's consultant told her about the UK Living Kidney Sharing Scheme, which has been running for more than a decade."It is where couples like us can be paired up and help each other out," says Mandy."My brilliant husband didn't hesitate for a moment."I tried desperately to talk him out of it but he was having none of it."Computer programme The kidney sharing scheme uses an algorithm designed at Glasgow University.It goes through everyone who has volunteered and tries to find better matches and maximise the number of possible transplants.The computer programme is run four times a year and the transplants are then scheduled by a dedicated coordinator.Image caption Sarah Lundie is one of the donor scheme coordinators It is a logistical challenge, according to Sarah Lundie, the coordinator at Edinburgh's Royal Infirmary.In order for even the simplest kidney swap to go ahead you need two healthy donors and two recipients who are also not suffering from any illnesses.If any one of them gets so much as a cold, the whole carefully arranged schedule must be cancelled.Ms Lundie must also make sure that there are operating theatres booked at both locations and four surgeons must be available to carry out the procedures, not to mention their extensive back-up teams.There is also a great deal of liaison going on to ensure that the organs are transported from the donors to the recipients at the same time.Image caption Graham and Mandy said it was a relief to get to the day of the operation As he sat in Edinburgh waiting to donate his kidney, Graham Murray, 53, was aware that there was someone in Belfast, who must remain anonymous, waiting to give up a kidney so that it could be donated to Mandy.Graham says: "Getting to this morning with everyone fit and healthy and ready to go is a great relief."His wife Mandy, 57, says they have felt the "responsibility" of keeping well in the weeks before the operations so that the donor sharing chain would not be broken.She says: "Graham and I decided to sequester ourselves in our house, get our shopping delivered and really try not to catch anything so we could make sure that bond could be maintained."Graham and his counterpart in Belfast are the first part of the surgical equation.Both donor kidneys are removed simultaneously in the two locations.In Edinburgh, consultant transplant surgeon John Terrace scrubs up for an operation he says usually takes about three hours.Image caption Mr John Terrace, consultant transplant surgeon, RIE "I'm thinking about the donor rather than the recipient," he says."The focus with donors is operating safely and meticulously.The risk to donors is actually very small."Mr Terrace says he uses a modified form of keyhole surgery to remove the kidney.Image caption Mr Terrace uses a modified form of keyhole surgery He uses laparoscopy to see but also has his hand inside the patient."That offers an extra element of control and safety," Mr Terrace says."The first 80% is moving things out of the way, moving the liver and the bowel and identifying the kidney and the structures that go into it and come out - the vein, the artery and ureter."He says these are then prepared so the kidney can be removed quickly but still be suitable for "reimplantation" into the recipient.Once the kidney is removed it is quickly on its way.In this case, the organs leave Edinburgh and Belfast on chartered flights, arriving in time for the donation surgery to happen in the afternoon.Image caption Consultant transplant surgeon Sorina Cornateanu performed Mandy's operation Mandy's kidney surgery is performed by consultant Sorina Cornateanu.She uses blood vessels going to the leg to help attach the new kidney.Then the blood supply is returned and the kidney turns pink and perfused.Often the kidney passes urine on the operating table.Image caption Ms Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success The surgery takes about three hours and the patient is immediately started on anti-rejection drugs and goes into a high-dependency unit.After successfully operating on Mandy, Ms Cornateanu describes her team as the "vehicles" between the donor and the recipient."That's our role.It is fulfilling, rewarding, humbling and it is a big relief at this stage."Ms Cornateanu said the shared donor scheme had been a big success and even in the past year the number of live donor transplants had risen in Edinburgh by half to 14."It has been a big team effort from all of us and we need to sustain that.That's the challenge."Living donors Across Scotland, 50 kidney sharing scheme transplants have taken place in the past five years.It is more common for living donor transplants to involve a relative or friend who is a close match but this is not always possible.Another form of living donation is "altruistic".Over the past 10 years, 78 people in Scotland have donated a kidney to a stranger.The day after their operations, Mandy and Graham were told the other donor and recipient in the chain were doing well.Graham said: "That's fantastic.We never expected to know.""I'm so pleased," said Mandy.The pair hope they will soon be recovered enough to fulfil all the plans they have had to put on hold until now.
‘I’m 35, with two young children – and Parkinson’s’:::::At 29, Ellie Finch Hulme was diagnosed with a condition often associated with much older people - Parkinson's disease.She decided it wasn't going to stop her living her life the way she wanted to.Ellie doesn't fit the stereotype of someone with Parkinson's disease, as one of her recent tweets makes clear.People are often shocked when they meet her for the first time, she says."I volunteer in a local charity shop occasionally around the kids and around my work and if I'm trembling, if I have to wrap something up - because anything can set off your tremor - someone will say something like, 'Is it your first day here?'And I'll be like, 'No, I've got Parkinson's.'"They expect someone with Parkinson's to be white-haired and stooping, but Ellie, who lives in Farnham in Surrey, has young onset (or early onset) Parkinson's disease, and was diagnosed before she was 30.How people react A survey of more than 2,000 people for Parkinson's UK, to mark World Parkinson's day, found that 87% of people with the condition had faced discrimination or harassment.24% of people had been told they were "too young" to have Parkinson's 22% said their slurred speech or poor balance had been mistaken for drunkenness 32% said their less expressive facial expressions had been mistaken for unfriendliness 10% said they had been laughed at More than half (57%) said they had avoided or cancelled social situations because of concerns about how others would react to them.For more information see Parkinson's Is She first experienced symptoms when she was training for a half marathon in 2012.At first it was just a tremor in her left little finger, then her left leg started to go from under her as she ran.Her GP suspected the problem was something called "essential tremor", a movement disorder, but Ellie wasn't convinced.After seeing a neurologist in April 2013 she underwent a series of scans and tests and was finally diagnosed with the condition that August.Image caption Ellie became engaged to her boyfriend, Tom, a month after her first appointment with a neurologist By coincidence, in her work as a translator Ellie had been working on a text about one of the scans she herself was given.This led her to suspect she had Parkinson's before it was confirmed."I had a feeling that that's what it would be.But a lot of my friends were like, 'No, don't get ahead of yourself, it won't be that, it can't be that.'"Ellie says it took a long time to accept that she had Parkinson's but one of the hardest experiences was having to break the news to friends and relatives."I think it was more difficult for friends and family to accept than it really was for me," she says.Ellie and her fiance, Tom, had already planned to marry the following March and soon after returning from their honeymoon, Ellie realised she was pregnant.Image copyright Matthew Quake "That was intentional," she says."We knew we wanted to have kids and we wanted to do it sooner rather than later.In no way was I prepared to sacrifice that because of this condition."Not many people with Parkinson's disease become pregnant.Although a third of people with the condition get it before the age of 65, only one in 20 get it below the age of 45, and only one in 100 below the age of 40, according to Prof Huw Morris, consultant neurologist at the Royal Free Hospital and professor of clinical neuroscience at University College London.The symptoms - slower movements, stiffness and sometimes tremors - are caused by a loss of nerve cells in the brain, and a reduction in the amount of dopamine, the chemical in the brain that helps with movement.Treatment for Parkinson's therefore includes dopamine replacement."We think that Levodopa, the main dopamine treatment, is probably safe in pregnancy, but it's difficult to know that," says Huw Morris.Ellie says she felt extremely anxious throughout the whole of her pregnancy, even though the dose of her medication was reduced."It was scary.I was pretty concerned," she says."I just didn't know how the drugs were going to affect the foetus at all."In January 2015, Ellie went into labour on the day of her baby shower and gave birth to a son called Charlie three weeks early.She took the decision not to breastfeed Charlie because of the risk that the drugs would be passed to him through her breast milk - she was told this was higher than the risk of them reaching the foetus had been."I found that absolutely heartbreaking," she says."I always thought that I would breastfeed and I was not able to and it took a long time to get over that."By this stage Ellie had a tremor in her left arm and hand, which made it harder to bottle feed her son.Holding him on her left side she would bottle feed him with her right hand, but it wasn't easy to keep her arm in a comfortable position - especially when she was doing it in public."Bath time was a bit scary," she says."But I used to do that when my husband was there."Ellie also struggled with some of the fiddlier baby clothes, such as doing up the poppers on Babygros or getting zips up.She buys shoes with Velcro fastenings to avoid problems with laces.Twenty-two months after Charlie was born, in November 2016, Ellie gave birth to her daughter, Sophie."We were like, 'Let's just go for it, because I'm not going to get any better, so therefore it's probably better to just get through a second pregnancy sooner rather than later.'But obviously not too soon."She says her reaction to having two small children was probably the same as any parent's."It's quite kind of, 'Wow!'A lot of things to deal with, like getting my son weaned off his dummy and then starting his potty training.And obviously, having a newborn, it's a lot to cope with.But it's a lot for any parent," she says."I've tried not to let having Parkinson's really affect any of what I was doing with the kids when they were little."Ellie says her children know that she takes medication and her son, now four, has started to ask some questions."As he gets older and he's able to understand, and his empathy builds as he grows, I think that it will be easier for me to say, 'This is what doesn't work properly,'" she says."But they've never once said to me, 'Mummy, why do you shake?'"The speed at which the disease develops tends to be slower in people with early onset Parkinson's, says Huw Morris.Treatments are very effective, he says, but there is nothing that can stop it in its tracks.Like Ellie, the actor Michael J Fox was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's at the age of 29, and he's still acting occasionally in his late 50s.Ellie says her hopes for the future are mostly the same as any person with children."I hope that my children understand all my decisions and the choice that my husband and I made to have them - and I'm pretty sure they will," she says."I do hope that I won't be a burden on them, that they won't see it like that, because one day I'll probably need to be cared for, and that's really quite difficult to say, to be honest."Help and information: NHS: Parkinson's disease Parkinson's UK NICE: Parkinson's disease The Cure Parkinson's Trust National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke Ellie says she does not spend each day wondering, 'What's my life going to be like?'but takes each day as it comes."I think that's the best way to be, to be positive and don't worry about what the future holds, either positive or negative, because you could get run over by a bus tomorrow and it would be totally unrelated to Parkinson's.It's just not worth worrying about."Ellie says it is frustrating people tend to associate Parkinson's with just one thing - tremors - and are unaware of other symptoms."I do have a lot of stiffness in my hand," she says."So at times when my medicine's wearing off I just can't raise my arm for example and my hand is completely stiff.People don't realise that is one of the main symptoms - and pain as well, and cramps."Rates of anxiety and depression are also higher in people with young onset Parkinson's disease, according to Huw Morris.Ellie says the things that have helped her most with her condition are continuing to do plenty of exercise, connecting with other young people who live with Parkinson's and avoiding the temptation to compare herself to others - because each person is different.It's impossible to know whether her condition will progress faster, slower or at the same speed as someone else's."It's not like a death sentence," says Ellie."Hopefully I'll live a fulfilled life with this condition for many years."All photographs courtesy of Ellie Finch Hulme, unless otherwise indicated.Ellie writes a blog about what life is like as a young mum with Parkinson's disease called PD Mama You may also be interested in: When Sarah Hill's eight-year-old son complained of aching legs, her GP told her not to worry.But it was one of the first signs Alex had Parkinson's disease.Read: 'My son was diagnosed with Parkinson's at the age of 11' See also: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Just a little bit of me is hoping something wonderful will happen Tom Isaacs was diagnosed with Parkinson's aged 27.And for 17 years he's been desperate to find a cure.Now along with 41 others he's volunteered for a ground-breaking medical trial of a drug called GDNF.Will this be the miracle that millions of Parkinson's patients around the world have been waiting for?Viewers in the UK can watch the second part of the two-part documentary The Parkinson's Drug Trial: A Miracle Cure?on the iPlayer -

Aphantasia: Ex-Pixar chief Ed Catmull says 'my mind's eye is blind':::::Image copyright Pixar The former president of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios says he has a "blind mind's eye".Most people can close their eyes and conjure up images inside their head such as counting sheep or imagining the face of a loved one.But Ed Catmull, 74, has the condition aphantasia, in which people cannot visualise mental images at all.And in a surprising survey of his former employees, so do some of the world's best animators.Ed revolutionised 3D graphics, and the method he developed for animating curved surfaces became the industry standard.He first realised his brain was different when trying to perform Tibetan meditation with a colleague.Visualisation is a core part of the practice and he was told to picture a sphere in front of him.Ed told the BBC: "I went home, closed my eyes I couldn't see a thing and for an entire week I kept trying to visualise this sphere."He spoke to colleagues and learned that some animators could form mental images so strong they would open their eyes and the image would still be there, so they could practically trace what they could see.Ed just thought: "That's interesting, it's probably what makes them an artist."Glen Keane But eventually Ed realised he was not alone and that, perhaps counter-intuitively, some of the greatest talents in animation could not visualise either.Oscar-winner Glen Keane, who created Ariel (The Little Mermaid), also has no visual imagery.Ed told the BBC: "He is truly extraordinary, he's one of the best animators in the history of hand-drawn animation."[And] he said that he could never visualise either."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Glen Keane (right) won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film for Dear Basketball, alongside former NBA star Kobe Bryant.Image copyright Walt Disney, Glen Keane Image caption Glen Keane's early sketch of Ariel, the Little Mermaid.Image copyright Walt Disney, Glen Keane Image caption Ariel in more recognisable form.Ed said: "When he first did The Little Mermaid, it's a bunch of scribbles."And then it converges, after he works on it for a while, into this gorgeous piece of art."And as far as he's concerned, that's the right way to work because it means he's looking deep down inside, for his emotions, and that's what drives his drawing."Origins of aphantasia The term aphantasia was coined by Prof Adam Zeman, from the University of Exeter Medical School, in 2015.He had documented a case of a man who lost his mind's eye in his 60s following a heart operation.Prof Zeman was then contacted by people who reported never having one and he described the condition as aphantasia in the journal Cortex.Around one in 50 people is thought to have aphantasia, although exactly what is going on in the brain is still unclear.Parts of the brain from the frontal and parietal lobes are involved in visualisation and differences at any point in the system could be the cause.Pixar findings Image copyright Shutterstock Ed, who co-founded Pixar, had a parting gift for his former employees when he left last year - a piece of homework.He asked 540 members of staff to take a test of the vividness of their visual imagery.He sorted the results into: All staff Technical artists - who have a strong background in computer programming as well as artistry Artists - the animators, film designers or storyboard artists Production managers - often people out of film school who organise the production It showed that the artists were slightly better than technical artists at visualising, but the differences were not that huge."It was not a large skew, that's the real issue," said Ed.The production managers were better than both.The homework also revealed stark differences between two artists and good friends of Ed's who had worked on Frozen.One can see an entire movie in his head and play it backwards and forwards and never needs to see a movie twice because he can visualise it.The other cannot see anything at all.Lessons from aphantasia Some people with aphantasia find it a cause of distress.People have described feeling isolated and alone after discovering that other people could see images in their heads and they could not.Ed argues aphantasia is not a barrier to success.He told the BBC: "I think the main message is, 'OK folks you can't use it as an excuse, you can still do good work, regardless of your differences'."And believes the study clears up misperceptions about the creativity.He added: "People had conflated visualisation with creativity and imagination and one of the messages is, 'they're not the same thing'."The other one I think that people might have assumed, but if you think about it you can see why it's false assumption, is you would think if a person could visualise, they're more likely to be able to draw."If you open your eyes and you take out a pencil and pad, how many people can draw what they see?The answer is a very small number, so if you can't draw what is in front of you then why would we expect that you would be able to draw what you visualise?"Discovering he has aphantasia has also led to some insight into Ed's personal life, because his wife has very strong visual imagery.He can remember their first date was in a park on the other side of the freeway and that is it.She can describe the whole area.Prof Zeman, who has led research in the field of aphantasia, said: "I think it's really helpful for people to know that the way they visualise - or not - doesn't define them."Although we all have different thought processes, that doesn't link with the quality of what you produce."We just all go about it in different ways."If you think you have aphantasia or hyperphantasia and would like to be involved in Prof Zeman's research he is happy to be contacted at a.zeman@exeter.ac.uk Follow James on Twitter.
The benefits of physical activity for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities:::::What are the benefits?For all children, the benefits of engaging in regular physical activity are well-established.Focus is often cast on physical benefits such as improved cardio-vascular fitness, reduced risk of becoming overweight or obese, and increased bone and muscle strength.These are especially important for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) who, in general, experience poorer physical health outcomes than other children of the same age.There is also evidence pointing towards a relationship between physical activity and improved mental well-being, the development of problem solving skills, and increased concentration and academic achievement among children with SEND.When children with SEND engage in physical activity in groups, especially when those groups include children without SEND, they have been found to develop important life skills like verbal and non-verbal communication, sharing and the ability to make and keep friends.These skills are crucial in later life for developing strong and supportive social networks, gaining employment and living independently.Inclusion 'Inclusive' physical activities, whereby children with and without SEND participate with and against each other, are beneficial to all children.For instance, research suggests that there are significant social benefits for children without SEND, such as increased tolerance to individual differences, greater awareness and sensitivity to human diversity and the needs of others.Therefore, the onus should be on physical activity providers to deliver inclusive physical activities, whether that be in school, club or other settings.Studies have shown that children with SEND participate less frequently and in a narrower range of physical activities than other children of the same age.While the reasons for this are complex and can differ from child-to-child, research suggests that some of the main issues relate to attitudes to 'including' children with SEND among teachers, coaches and other children; a lack of specialist knowledge, skills and confidence to teach and coach children with SEND; schools, leisure facilities and clubs being inappropriately resourced to provide physical activity opportunities to children with SEND; and a lack of accessible information about opportunities to engage in physical activity in local communities.Good practice Fortunately, there is a growing number of organisations that are doing excellent work to ensure that children with SEND have the opportunities to develop physical activity habits that last a lifetime.School, whether that be a special or mainstream setting, is an ideal context for children to engage in physical activity through formal, structured physical education lessons, and lunchtime and after school clubs.More recently, attempts have been made to encourage parents and children to abandon their cars and build physical activity into their travel to and from school plans.Playground markings and 'the daily mile' are also being used by schools to encourage physical activity engagement during break time.Here, success will depend on the extent to which these opportunities are aligned to the specific needs and capabilities of the children.'One size fits all' approaches are mostly ineffective ways of increasing physical activity participation levels among children with SEND.Therefore, it is vital that those delivering physical activity to children with SEND have the appropriate knowledge, skills, experience and confidence to do so.The Youth Sport Trust (YST), which is a national children's charity committed to ensuring that every child can enjoy the benefits associated with physical activity, is one of many organisations working in partnership with schools.Through its Lead Inclusion School Network, the YST provides training, advice and guidance to school leaders about the development of provision aimed at ensuring that children with SEND can engage and participate in regular physical activity.This is part of a broader attempt to upskill primary school teachers in particular, many of whom are not physical education nor SEND or inclusion experts.Given that childhood is crucial for establishing positive (or negative) habits, primary school teachers are one group who play an important role in shaping the physical activity participation tendencies of children with SEND.The training of teachers and coaches is vital.Teachers and coaches should receive awareness training about the benefits of children with and without SEND participating in physical activities together.Moreover, through appropriate training teachers and coaches need to understand and be able to apply principles of inclusion through the modification and adaptation of physical activities to suit the needs and capabilities of all children.Here, a 'capabilities' approach is essential when working with children with SEND.For far too long we have focused on understanding what children with SEND cannot do, and how to meet their needs.While this is useful, so too is casting light on what these children are good at.Child-centred approach Like all children, it is important that those with SEND are stretched and challenged so that they can fulfil their sporting and physical activity potential.To achieve this, a child-centred approach is required.Children with SEND should be involved in decisions that shape their lives.After all, these children know and understand their needs and capabilities much more than an adult without SEND.Involving children in this way has been found to increase motivation, engagement, self-esteem, and feelings of self-worth among children with SEND.Parents Parental involvement is also crucial.Parents act as role models to children.Children with SEND, like all children, are more likely to be physically active outside of school if their parents are.After all, parents are often the ones that find opportunities for their children to be physically active, pay any associated costs, and act as taxi driver.Therefore, engaging in physical activity outside of school as a family is important.Going to the park for a walk, to woodlands or forests to play, or joining local clubs or leisure centres are a few ways in which families of children with SEND can engage in physical activity together.The BBC has teamed up with the Premier League to create 'Super Movers', which aims to inspire primary school children to become more physically active.If you are looking for opportunities for your child to join a local club, the Parasport and BBC's Get Inspired 'club finders' are useful starting points.Boccia, goalball and wheelchair dance are just a few examples of activities with a particular emphasis on inclusion.Alternatively, the Activity Alliance deliver inclusive sporting events.
Umbilical cord art - would you do it?:::::Image copyright reddit/u/Icy9kills Image caption Reddit user Icy9kills both amazed and angered users of a reddit thread with this image When Icy9kills uploaded a picture of a frame spotted at their aunt's house to Reddit, they may have expected weird and wonderful visceral reactions were to come.And with the title on the post being "My aunt framed my cousin's umbilical cord and shaped it as a heart", the other Redditers did not fail to show their shock and fascination with the artistic effort.In a pregnant woman, the umbilical cord joins the foetus to the placenta - the organ responsible for providing oxygen and nutrients, and removing waste substances.While traditionally it tends to be removed as a waste product after the birthing process, it appears as though umbilical cord art has a cult following among new mothers.Images are available for inspiration, observation and perturbation across all major social platforms.Indeed in 2017, The Saturdays singer and television presenter Rochelle Humes revealed she had turned her baby's umbilical cord into art.On Reddit though, the reaction was generally a negative one with user commenting: "Yeah I remember cleaning out some old wardrobes and we found my brother's umbilical cord.It literally crumbled like a coffee cake.It was absolutely foul."While AronJanet42 wrote: "My mom has my umbilical cord, hair from my first haircut and baby teeth.She even has the tooth I knocked out while drunk at 19.Not sure if it's for a clone or for voodoo but something's coming".A lot of the conversation then veered around placentas and preserving those, with even some querying about whether this was cannibalism.The general consensus on that though was a no, it is not.You may also be interested in: Rachel Galvan decided to make a necklace out of her son Isaiah's cord and nails, and told the BBC her bespoke jewellery is "odd but treasured".Image copyright Rachel Galvan Image caption Isaiah Asher's umbilical cord and newborn nails in necklace format "I gave birth at 18 while at university and it was a very hard endeavour.It was an unexpected pregnancy, which was a shock to my family, friends, and college."I did not tell a single soul except my then boyfriend - now husband - about the life growing inside me until my ninth month of pregnancy."Rachel remembered her mum fainting, her dad crying, her friends gossiping and she said everything just seemed to fall apart.However, she completed her university exams and said the whole process was a learning curve."My boy is wonderfully made and I believe we are specially made for each other.He is a gift and the necklace is a constant reminder he has changed my life and the people surrounding me."What better use of his body parts than to create something so beautiful out of this rather than it just staying in a baby book forever leaving it to disintegrate?Produced by Dhruti Shah and Victoria Park, UGC Hub, BBC News

to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress; and to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025.If Mrs May regularly referred to a "climate crisis" or "climate emergency", that might fill their wish that the government should "tell the truth".A citizens' assembly looks unlikely, especially during the current constitutional mayhem of Brexit.And the third objective of cutting CO2 emissions to almost zero by 2025 is surely unachievable.So, if not all this, then what?This weekend, I asked environmentalists on Twitter for their suggestions about what ministers can do to show XR they mean business.Here - in no particular order - is my summary of some of the responses, with my own micro-analysis along the way.Heathrow expansion - Just cancel it, many said: impose a graduated tax on frequent fliers instead This would be a huge symbolic step.Aviation forms a small proportion of UK emissions - but this would denote that ministers accept that climate change cannot be stopped by constantly fuelling a demand for growth.Home insulation - One said insulating the UK's draughty housing stock should become a National Infrastructure Priority - similar to upgrading the rail network This would be a big victory for protesters.The Treasury don't like subsidising property owners to improve the value of their houses - but there are few other plausible solutions big enough to tackle a vast problem.Make electric cars work, others tweeted.They say the Department for Transport is failing to deliver a charging network This is vitally important.The government is committed to zero emissions cars anyway, as part of its long-term climate plans.But ministers have been relying on the market to provide a charging network.And it hasn't.I recently borrowed an electric car for a trial visit into deepest Dorset.Both local charging stations malfunctioned, so I plugged into my sister-in-law's house.It blew her electrics.Sorry, Jane.How about getting farmers to cut emissions?UK farming has barely reduced emissions and some experts want widespread re-wilding so trees can capture CO2 This farming challenge can't be ducked.The government knows farmers have to cut emissions faster, but it's keen to protect them from economic damage.At least there's more policy flexibility with Brexit.Stop tax breaks to North Sea oil and gas - and ban fracking, others said If the ministers adopted this suggestion, it would show they were willing to put climate protection ahead of concerns over tax-raising and balance of payments.A tough ask for the Treasury, but one protesters say must be met if ministers really are serious about the climate.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Teen activist addresses Extinction Rebellion rally Bring back onshore wind, they say: it's cheap and effective Another policy that would show ministers are putting the climate before politics.Onshore wind farms are popular with the public at large but ministers rejected them after a fusillade of protests from constituents.Make it the duty of business to reduce emissions and protect nature, it was suggested The Bank of England governor Mark Carney seems already to be tip-toeing in this direction with his warnings to banks and firms about the risks of climate change.But how far can the present system change without breaking?Get a move on, came another call.Many said if we really want to tackle climate change we should be going as fast as we can, not setting arbitrary target dates like 2050 This is a tricky one.Governments like to deal in hard numbers and targets, not "try your best" aphorisms.Even in the relatively climate-conscious nations those numbers aren't always hit.And how about ending consumerist capitalism?My correspondents are divided on this.Some think the current political system can deliver the investment needed for a carbon neutral economy, if ministers put the right policies in place urgently.Other say only the overthrow of capitalism will protect the planet.The debate surely needs to be had, given the severity of the crisis in nature.So what does the government say?It says it is taking the climate protests seriously and rightly points out that it's been an international leader with its Climate Change Act.It will shortly consider whether to shift the UK's long-term climate target to virtually zero emissions by 2050 - that's tougher than the current 80% reduction by 2050.It admits that it's falling short of its medium-term climate targets.Will the changes I've outlined here be enough to satisfy XR?Maybe not - but they might weaken the movement by seducing some of their less ardent supporters.Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin
Greta Thunberg: Teen tells UK politicians 'listen to climate scientists':::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Greta Thunberg sparked an international movement fighting against climate change A teenage climate change activist has urged British politicians to "listen to the scientists" on climate change.Greta Thunberg, 16, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she did not expect to change their minds single-handedly, saying: "We need to do that together."The Swedish teenager, who inspired the school climate strikes movement, is expected to meet party leaders later.She also praised the work of Extinction Rebellion, as climate change protests continued into their second week.Miss Thunberg said her message for politicians was: "Listen to the science, listen to the scientists.Invite them to talk."I am just speaking on behalf of them, I'm trying to say what they've been saying for decades," she said.'Non-violent disruption' The teenager sparked an international youth movement after she staged a "School Strike for Climate" in front of the Swedish Parliament in August last year.Since then she has met Pope Francis and addressed the European Parliament.Speaking about her newfound fame, she said: "It's unbelievable, I can't really take it in."The interview comes as Extinction Rebellion activists took over part of the Natural History Museum on Monday.More than 1,000 people have been arrested since the protests began in central London a week ago.Miss Thunberg, who spoke to the crowds in Marble Arch on Sunday, told the BBC that disruptive action "definitely has a lot of impact".Asked whether it was necessary, she said: "As long as it's non-violent, I think that could definitely make a difference."'No point in anything' Miss Thunberg said she first heard about climate change aged about eight years old."I was just very moved," she said."When I was 11 I became very depressed," she added."It had a lot to do with the climate and ecological crisis.I thought everything was just so wrong and nothing was happening and there's no point in anything."After realising she could make a difference, she said she promised herself that "I was going to do something good with my life".The teenager also admitted that, when she first told her parents of her plan to miss school every Friday, they "weren't very fond of that idea".In the wide-ranging BBC interview, Miss Thunberg said that having Asperger's had helped her in life: "It makes me different, and being different is a gift I would say.It also makes me see things from outside the box."I don't easily fall for lies, I can see through things.If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike for instance."Asked what she would say if she met US President Donald Trump, she said: "I can't really say anything to him that he hasn't heard before."Obviously he's not listening to the science and to what we have to say so I wouldn't be able to change his mind."In 2017, Mr Trump announced the US would withdraw from the 2015 Paris agreement on tackling climate change.Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger
David Attenborough climate change TV show a 'call to arms':::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate Change - The Facts is available to watch on BBC iPlayer Sir David Attenborough's new BBC documentary on climate change has been praised by TV critics.Climate Change - The Facts, shown on BBC One on Thursday, was a "rousing call to arms", said the Guardian.In a four-star review, the Times said the veteran presenter "took a sterner tone... as though his patience was nearly spent".Sir David, 92, has called global warming "our greatest threat in thousands of years".In its review, The Arts Desk said: "Devastating footage of last year's climactic upheavals makes surreal viewing."While Earth has survived radical climactic changes and regenerated following mass extinctions, it's not the destruction of Earth that we are facing, it's the destruction of our familiar, natural world and our uniquely rich human culture."In the 20 years since I first started talking about the impact of climate change on our world, conditions have changed far faster than I ever imagined," Sir David said in the film.Image copyright AFP Image caption Climate change protesters have closed off central London since Monday "It may sound frightening, but the scientific evidence is that if we have not taken dramatic action within the next decade, we could face irreversible damage to the natural world and the collapse of our societies."In a glowing review, the Telegraph called the title of the documentary "robust" and praised the use of Sir David in the central role."At a time when public debate seems to be getting ever more hysterical," it said, "it's good to be presented with something you can trust.And we all trust Attenborough.""Sir David Attenborough might as well be narrating a horror film," wrote the FT. "A panoply of profs line up to explain that the science on climate change is now unequivocal, never mind the brief clip of Donald Trump prating: 'It's a hoax, it's a hoax, OK'."But it added: "Fortunately for our nerves the last 20 minutes focuses on what needs to be - and can be - done on an international and personal level."Sir David's concern over the impacts of climate change has become a major focus for the naturalist in recent years and has been a theme of his Our Planet series on Netflix.The new BBC programme has a strong emphasis on hope with Sir David arguing that if dramatic action is taken over the next decade, then the world can keep temperatures from rising more than 1.5C this century, limiting the scale of the damage.The programme - which is now available on the BBC iPlayer - was broadcast as Extinction Rebellion protesters continues to cause disruption in parts of central London.
Britain breaks coal-free power record over Easter weekend:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The government has set a target to phase out coal power by 2025 Britain has broken its record for the longest continuous period without generating electricity from coal.National Grid said that the coal-free period lasted more than 90 hours before coming to an end on Monday afternoon.It is the longest period since the industrial revolution and breaks the previous record set in April 2018 of 76 hours and 10 minutes.The government plans to phase out Britain's last coal power plants by 2025 to cut greenhouse gases.Duncan Burt, director of operations at National Grid, told BBC Radio 5 Live it was "a really big deal"."It's all about the sunny weather we've been seeing, so energy demand is low.There has been lots of lovely solar power off the panels too."Image copyright PA Image caption The sunny weather has led to low energy demand and a boost in solar power He said the UK generated a quarter of its energy from solar over the Easter weekend, with similar portions from nuclear and gas.The rest was imported from Europe.In April, 2017 Britain went its first full day without coal since the 19th century.Coal made up less than 10% of the country's energy mix last year and will be less than that again in 2019, according to National Grid.However, experts warned that power generated by coal was largely being replaced by gas, another fossil fuel, rather than renewable sources.They also said a reliance on gas made the UK vulnerable to the whims of international markets, and was not clean enough to meet the UK's legal targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions.The 2008 Climate Change Act requires greenhouse gas emissions to be reduced by 80% compared with 1990 levels by 2050.Muna Suleiman, climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: "89 hours of coal-free electricity is great but let's make this all day every day."Electricity generated by renewable sources is a key part of the fight against climate chaos so it's time to remove all the blockers to renewable energy."The government must prioritise the development of sources such as solar and onshore wind."

'Giant lion' fossil found in Kenya museum drawer:::::Image copyright AFP A new species of giant mammal has been identified after researchers investigated bones that had been kept for decades in a Kenyan museum drawer.The species, dubbed "Simbakubwa kutokaafrika" meaning "big African lion" in Swahili, roamed east Africa about 20 millions years ago.But the huge creature was part of a now extinct group of mammals called hyaenodonts.The discovery could help explain what happened to the group.Hyaenodonts - so called because their teeth resemble those of a modern hyena - were dominant carnivores more than 20 million years ago, National Geographic reports.But they are not related to hyenas."Based on its massive teeth, Simbakubwa was a specialised hyper-carnivore that was significantly larger than the modern lion and possibly larger than a polar bear," researcher Matthew Borths is quoted by AFP news agency as saying.In 2013 he was doing research at the Nairobi National Museum when he asked to look at the contents of a collection labelled "hyenas", National Geographic says.Image copyright Matthew Borths/ Nancy Stevens The creature's jaw and other bones and teeth had been put there after being found at a dig in western Kenya in the late 1970s.Mr Borths teamed up with another researcher, Nancy Stevens, and in 2017 they began analysing the unusual fossil specimens.Their findings were reported in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology this week.
Evidence of rabbits in UK in Roman times, say academics:::::Image copyright University of Exeter Image caption A bone from a rabbit found at Fishbourne Roman Palace Rabbits have been hopping around the UK since Roman times, experts have been able to prove for the first time.Scientific tests on a rabbit bone, found at Fishbourne Roman Palace in West Sussex, have shown the animal was alive in the first century AD.The 1.6in (4cm) piece of a tibia bone was found in 1964 but it remained in a box until 2017, when a zooarchaeologist realised that it came from a rabbit.Academics believe the animal could have been kept as an exotic pet.Analysis, including radiocarbon dating, was carried out by researchers at the universities of Exeter, Oxford and Leicester.Rabbits are native to Spain and France and it had been thought they were introduced to Britain during the medieval period.Prof Naomi Sykes, from the University of Exeter, said there have been many previous claims of discoveries of Roman rabbits, and even some from the Bronze Age, but they had not been backed up by evidence."The bone fragment was very small, meaning it was overlooked for decades, and modern research techniques mean we can learn about its date and genetic background as well," she said.Researchers say they believe the rabbit was kept as a pet, as the signature in its bones suggests it ate its own faecal pellets."When they are in a hutch they tend to eat their own poo, and that gives them a really interesting signature in their bones, wild rabbits don't do that to the same extent," said Prof Sykes.She added: "This is a tremendously exciting discovery and this very early rabbit is already revealing new insights into the history of the Easter traditions."Why do we associate bunnies with Easter?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Easter Bunny is part of an annual Easter tradition at the White House It is not clear when, why or how the rabbit became linked to Easter.Rabbits usually give birth to a big litter of babies (called kittens), and so they became a symbol of new life.The first historical mention of an "Easter Bunny" is actually an Easter hare, and was found in a German text from 1682.Some believe the association is due to the spread of Christian religious beliefs and Paganism, when Emperor Constantine merged Pagan rituals with Christian festivals.The story of the Easter Bunny is thought to have become common in the 19th Century.Prof Sykes says that during the Victorian period hare proportions were really low, whereas the rabbit proportions were "really really high", which could explain how the hare was ditched for rabbits.How popular are pet rabbits?Image copyright iStock Rabbits are the third most popular pet choice, behind cats and dogs, according to PDSA Animal Wellbeing Report 2018.It estimates one million are kept as pets in the country.They typically live for eight to 12 years, the RSPCA says.However, the Rabbit Welfare Association and Fund says rabbits are among the most abused and neglected pets in the country because some owners don't realise what's involved before taking them on.Rabbit facts you might not know Image copyright iStock Root vegetables aren't a natural part of a rabbit's diet -

Pig brains partially revived four hours after death:::::Image copyright Getty Images US scientists have partially revived pig brains four hours after the animals were slaughtered.The findings could fuel debate about the barrier between life and death, and provide a new way of researching diseases like Alzheimer's.The study showed the death of brain cells could be halted and that some connections in the brain were restored.However, there were no signals from the brain that would indicate awareness or consciousness.The surprise findings challenge the idea that the brain goes into irreversible decline within minutes of the blood supply being cut off.How was it done?Thirty-two pig brains were collected from an abattoir.Four hours later the organs were connected to a system made by the team at Yale University.It rhythmically pumped (to mimic the pulse) a specially designed liquid round the brain, which contained a synthetic blood to carry oxygen and drugs to slow or reverse the death of brain cells.The pig brains were given the restorative cocktail for six hours.What did the study show?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The researchers found synapses - the connections between brains - were working The study, published in the journal Nature, showed a reduction in brain cell death, the restoration of blood vessels and some brain activity.The researchers found working synapses - the connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate.The brains also showed a normal response to medication and used up the same amount of oxygen as a normal brain.This was all 10 hours after the pigs were decapitated.Crucially there was no sign of the brain-wide electrical activity in an electroencephalogram (EEG brain scan) that would signal awareness or perception.Fundamentally they were still dead brains.What have we learned?The research transforms ideas about how the brain dies, which many thought happened quickly and irreversibly without a supply of oxygen.Prof Nenad Sestan, a professor of neuroscience at Yale University, said: "Cell death in the brain occurs across a longer time window that we previously thought."What we are showing is the process of cell death is a gradual, stepwise process."And that some of those processes can be either postponed, preserved or even reversed."Are these experiments ethical?The pig brains came from the pork industry; the animals were not raised in a lab for this experiment.But the Yale scientists were so concerned the pigs might become conscious that they gave drugs to the disembodied brains to reduce any brain activity.And the team were constantly monitoring the brains to see if there was any sign of higher brain functions.In that case they would have used anaesthetic and ended the experiment.Ethicists, writing in Nature, say new guidelines are needed for this field because animals used for research could end up in a "grey area - not alive, but not completely dead".What is the point?Image copyright Getty Images The immediate benefit of this work will be for scientists studying the brain in diseases like Alzheimer's.The organ is the most complex structure in the known universe, but techniques such as freezing slices of the brain or growing colonies of brain cells in a dish do not let researchers explore the full 3D wiring of the brain.In the long term, scientists hope to find better ways of protecting the brain after traumas such as a stroke or being starved of oxygen at birth.Dr Andrea Beckel-Mitchener, from the Brain Initiative at the US National Institute of Mental Health, said: "This line of research could lead to a whole new way of studying the post-mortem brain."It also could stimulate research to develop interventions that promote brain recovery after loss of brain blood flow."However, the researchers say it is still far too early for the field to make a difference to patients after injury.Prof Sestan said: "We don't yet have knowledge whether we would be able to restore normal brain function."Does this change the meaning of death?At the moment no, but some ethicists say we should have the debate now as people who are "brain dead" are a major source of organs for transplant.Prof Dominic Wilkinson, a professor of medical ethics and a consultant neonatologist in Oxford, said: "Once someone has been diagnosed as 'brain dead' there is currently no way for that person to ever recover."The human person that they were has gone forever."If, in the future, it were possible to restore the function of the brain after death, to bring back someone's mind and personality, that would, of course, have important implications for our definitions of death."But that is not currently the case.Prof Tara Spires-Jones, deputy director of the Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh, said: "This study is a long way from preserving human brain function after death as portrayed in the cartoon Futurama where heads were kept alive in a jar."It is instead a temporary preservation of some of the more basic cell functions in the pig brain, not the preservation of thought and personality."Could the pigs' brains be aware?In this experiment the answer is a clear no.The brains were effectively silent.But the research does ask as many questions as it answers: How long can the researchers keep brains going?Would the results be even better if the researchers did not wait four hours before starting?Also, the team used drugs to suppress brain activity - would the decapitated brains have been aware if they hadn't?Follow James on Twitter.
Extinction Rebellion London activists chained to Jeremy Corbyn's home:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Specialist police teams were used to remove the group from the DLR train Climate change activists glued themselves to a train and others chained themselves to Jeremy Corbyn's home in a third day of protests.Extinction Rebellion protesters have been blocking traffic at Marble Arch, Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus since Monday.Earlier, three activists were glued to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train at Canary Wharf, causing minor delays.Four people also glued themselves together at the Labour leader's home.Image copyright PA Image caption Four people glued themselves together at Jeremy Corbyn's home in north London The activists, who also used a bike lock to attach themselves to Mr Corbyn's north London house, said they supported him but wanted the Labour Party to go further than declaring a "climate emergency".After ending their protest Tracee Williams, one of the group, said she did not think the action was a "misstep but whether we'd do it again, I'm not so sure".Mr Corbyn left his home but declined to meet or speak to any of the protesters.Easter eggs and flowers from the group, which had been taken into Mr Corbyn's home earlier, were later returned to the street by the Labour leader's wife Laura Alvarez.Ms Williams added the group "really felt we had to bring it to his front door" but "feel absolutely terrible about upsetting his wife".As of 17:00 BST, 340 people have been arrested since Monday over the protests, the Met Police said.Image copyright PA Image caption Jeremy Corbyn declined to speak to any of the protesters when he left his home The campaigner who glued himself to a train window was removed about an hour after the start of the DLR protest, at about 10:50.The man and a woman who unfurled a banner and glued themselves to the top of the train's carriage were also later removed and carried off by officers.BTP said three people had been arrested for obstructing the railway.Extinction Rebellion targeted the DLR after members changed their minds about disrupting the Tube network.It came after BTP ordered Transport for London (TfL) to switch off wifi at Tube stations to deter protests.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Two activists climbed on to a train at Canary Wharf while another glued his hand to the window Supt Matt Allingham said extra officers would be on duty throughout the day, adding: "We will not tolerate any activity which disrupts the millions of passengers who rely on using the rail network in London."Campaigners at Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus have been ordered to restrict their protests to Marble Arch.The Met said protesters were being removed from both areas and those who did not comply would be arrested.Image copyright @ExtinctionR Image caption Police have been sent in to clear protesters from Waterloo Bridge, Parliament Square and Oxford Circus How do you unglue a protester?The Metropolitan Police says it uses a "fluid de-bonding agent" - but refuses to specify what that contains for operational reasons.Dr Mark Elliott, a senior lecturer in organic chemistry at Cardiff University, said warm, soapy water or the compound acetone would be the most suitable method - but warned any removal was likely to be painful."Anyone who has inadvertently stuck their fingers together with superglue will know how difficult and painful it can be to separate then - and the fingertips are relatively tough," he says."It is even more painful when other, softer, areas of skin become bonded."According to Dr Elliott, the general advice is to use warm, soapy water, then to apply gentle pressure - for example by inserting a spatula."This will inevitably take time and be rather painful," he warned.Alternatively, acetone - normally found in nail-varnish remover - can make it easier to remove the glue - but "easier", he adds, "is very much a relative term".How do you un-glue a protester?(published 2010) The BBC's Dominic Casciani said about a dozen people were carried to police vans at Oxford Circus after failing to comply with police.Springwatch presenter Chris Packham, who was at the protest in Oxford Circus, said the atmosphere was "peaceful and resolute".Most of the people arrested so far have been held over public order offences.The Met Police said "contingency plans are in place should custody suites become full".Image copyright AFP Image caption Protesters are being removed from Waterloo Bridge by police Extinction Rebellion earlier said "thousands" more people were willing to be arrested as part of the non-violent disruption.It had been planning to target London Underground to "highlight the emergency of ecological collapse" and persuade ministers to meet group members.The campaign group said: "Today we will disrupt one overground line as part of our escalating campaign to demand the government acts now on the climate and ecological emergency."London Mayor Sadiq Khan urged protesters to "think again", adding public transport helped tackle climate change.Music student Anouska Stahlmann said her ill mother and elderly grandparents were forced to walk part of their journey to avoid risking being stuck in a Tube tunnel.The 20-year-old said: "I have no issue with wanting to better the environment and we're fairly conscious of it as a family."Their methods, however, are seriously flawed and are not inclusive of people who want to support the cause."Image copyright EPA Image caption So far, 340 people have been arrested during the week's protests Protester and climate lawyer Farhana Yamin, who was arrested on Tuesday, earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I totally want to apologise to people using public transport."But at the same time we need to take actions that are disruptive so everyone understands the dangers we're facing right now."Image copyright DANIEL LEAL-OLIVAS/AFP/Getty Images Image caption Oxford Street has been empty of traffic since activists parked a pink boat in Oxford Circus on Monday Jace Tyrrell, chief executive of New West End Company, said the West End lost 12m in trade because of the first two days of protests.He told BBC Radio London: "Everyone has a right to peaceful protest.But this is really disruptive."In Edinburgh, dozens of people were arrested earlier this week when hundreds of protesters blocked a main road.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police ordered protesters to retreat to the site of their camp at Marble Arch Organisers said protests had been held in more than 80 cities across 33 countries and action in London was planned until 29 April.Environment Secretary Michael Gove said "it's appropriate for people to make their feelings known" but added: "We've got the message; we understand that action needs to be taken."Speaking on the BBC's The One Show, he said some of the protest action had been "over the top" but driven by a "legitimate desire to put climate change and the environment further up the agenda".Mr Gove said the UK had "played a role in reducing carbon emissions and at the same time growing the economy", but admitted "there is more to be done".What is Extinction Rebellion?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Extinction Rebellion: The story behind the activist group Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament.It has three core demands: for the government to "tell the truth about climate change", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress.Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible.But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.The government said it shared "people's passion" to combat climate change and "protect our planet for future generations".The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the UK had cut its emissions by 44% since 1990.A spokesman said: "We've asked our independent climate experts for advice on a net zero emissions target and set out plans to transition to low emission vehicles and significantly reduce pollution."Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger
Only one in 50 people have nights free from light pollution:::::Image copyright CPRE Just one in 50 people in England experiences nights that are free from light pollution, according to the results of a survey.The work, carried out for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), suggests the situation has not improved since it raised the issue 12 years ago.The group says everyone should be able to witness the glory of a starry night.More than half the people taking part said they couldnt see more than 10 stars in the constellation Orion.The self-selecting survey asked 2,300 people to count the stars in this constellation as a measure of light pollution in their area.But the CPRE cant be sure how similar the group of people completing the last survey was to the one carrying out this one.Just a 10th of people could count up to 30 stars, whereas the Royal Observatory in Greenwich says that up to 40 could be visible to someone with a sharp eye on a clear night.Only 2% of participants had truly dark skies which allowed them to see more than 30 stars.Thats half the level of the previous Star Count in 2014.A record 2,300 people took part in the count, and the group says government, councils and the public should treat the issue more seriously.Stargazing is not the only reason for craving the darkness: artificial light at night can rob people of their sleep and harm health.It can also have disruptive effects on wildlife.Emma Marrington from the CPRE said the authorities should dim lights wherever feasible.Image copyright CPRE Image caption Light pollution obscures the stars in Eastbourne She also urged house-holders not to leave on outdoor lights overnight.Leaving them on has become increasingly affordable with the widespread use of LEDs.Ms Marrington said: Light doesnt respect boundaries, and careless use can see it spread for miles from towns, cities, businesses and motorways.That results in the loss of one of the countrysides most magical sights a dark, starry night sky.Some councils have responded previously by switching off street lights after midnight, which had the added benefit of saving cash.But they often faced accusations of putting peoples safety at risk.The Local Government Association told BBC News it didnt have a position on light pollution.Highways England said it had revised its policies on lighting.A spokesperson told us: "We have a better understanding of where night-time accidents occur and the impact road lighting would have, so we can now be more precise about what sections need to be lit rather than a blanket lighting approach."Risk assessments will be carried out the determine the need for the lighting.If there is no case to keep it will be de-commissioned."Follow Roger Harrabinon Twitter.
Rare kakapo parrots have best breeding season on record:::::Image copyright New Zealand Department of Conservation Image caption Kakapo were one of New Zealand's most common birds, but are now on the brink of extinction Kakapos - the world's fattest species of parrot - have had their most successful breeding season on record, according to New Zealand's Department of Conservation (DOC).The flightless, nocturnal parrots were once one of the country's most common birds, but only 147 adults are left.This year, 76 chicks have been hatched under the DOC's conservation scheme, with 60 expected to reach adulthood.The new batch is more than double that of the last breeding season in 2016.Kakapos only breed every two to four years when their favourite fruit grows in New Zealand's Rimu trees - the period is known as a "mast year".Their numbers have also been curbed by hunting, deforestation, and predators like stoats which were introduced by European settlers.One scientific advisor to the DOC, Dr Andrew Digby, says scientists have seen bumper quantities of fruit on Rimu trees in recent years, an occurrence possibly caused by climate change.With so much fruit, many female kakapos have bred earlier and, in some cases, laid two clutches of eggs.Image copyright Andrew Digby/NZ Department of Conservation Image caption All newborn kakapo chicks are raised in a secure facility before being released into the wild Until the 1970s, kakapos were thought to be extinct but a group was discovered on Stewart Island, south of the country's South Island.Just 18 were known to exist by 1977, but New Zealand's DOC has spearheaded efforts to boost its population on two remote, predator-free islands.Under the scheme, all newborn kakapo chicks are raised in a secure facility and later released into the wild, tagged with a transmitter.Each parrot also has its nest fitted with sensors and cameras, and is given a tailored diet via nearby feeding stations."They don't get a lot of privacy," Dr Digby said."I can log online and see what they're doing, see who they've mated with, how long for, and even the quality of the mating."It's probably one of the most intensively managed species in the world, certainly in New Zealand."Image copyright Andrew Digby/NZ Department of Conservation Image caption The DOC says it wants to see 500 kakapos in the wild, but is "attempting to back off" with each new breeding season To raise awareness of the bird and the DOC's work, the department hosted a "chick viewing session" earlier this month.The DOC also has an "advocacy" kakapo, named Sirocco, who tours the country as an Official Spokesbird for Conservation."People fall in love with them," said Dr Digby."They don't behave like a bird, they're a little bit human."They even look like a grumpy old man and they all have different personalities," he added.Looking ahead, Dr Digby said the DOC wants to see population levels hit 500, but is "continually attempting to back off, with a bit less intensity each breeding season.""The aim of our programme is for every child to grow up knowing what a kakapo is, just like an elephant or a lion."
TED 2019: The $50 lab burger transforming food:::::Image copyright Impossible Foods Image caption Impossible Foods has just launched its plant-based meat burger in Burger King Bruce Friedrich has been a vegetarian for 30 years but he has recently been enjoying the taste of meat again.The burgers he has been tucking into have been described by Bill Gates as "the future of food" - lab-grown meat culled from the cells of animals.Mr Friedrich was at the TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference to talk about how lab-grown meat could feed an ever-increasing population and solve environmental issues.The firm Beyond Meat was also in Vancouver to give delegates a taste of its plant-based meat substitute.Beyond Meat, along with Silicon Valley firm Impossible Foods, are already offering plant-based meat alternatives but there are dozens of firms experimenting with developing meat products which takes the cells of living animals and 'grows' meat from them.Mr Friedrich thinks the general public will get their first taste of cell-based meat in 2020 but, initially at least, will have to pay a premium of around $50 (38).The founder of the Good Food Institute, an organisation supporting the creation of plant and cell-based meat, has become one of this year's TED fellows.His think tank has ploughed $2.8m (2.1m) into 14 projects which are developing ways to grow meat and scale it up to mass production - and hoping to get the price tag down in the process.Image copyright TED/Ryan Lash Image caption Mr Friedrich campaigns for a new approach to meat production Cultured meat, or clean meat as it is sometimes called because of its low environmental impact, has the ability to transform farming, Mr Friedrich told the BBC."We grow a massive amount of crops just to feed farm animals.For every nine calories we put into a chicken we get one calorie out.It is a fantastically inefficient way to create food," he said."And it is estimated that we need to provide between 70% and 100% more meat by 2050."The demands of an ever-growing population, coupled with the environmental impact of intensive farming, means farmers have to look at alternative ways of producing meat, he said."We are not going to change human nature so we just have to change the meat," said Mr Friedrich.'Not another veggie burger' And this new age of synthetic meat has little to do with vegetarianism."We hear vegetarians say that they don't want to eat these products and we say, partly joking, that we really don't care what vegetarians think of it," he said."This is not yet another veggie burger."A clean meat "farm" will look very different - more like a brewery than a farm - and would not require any animals, said Mr Friedrich."The cells of the animals would be immortalised in cell banks," he explained."It would require 99% less land which means that farmers can move away from the 'get big or get out' theory of farming."There would still be farm sanctuaries where animals could live out their lives."Traditional crops like millet might see a comeback and farmers would be able to work "more in tune with the soil".This may seem like an idealised view of the future to some but already meat alternatives are going mass market.A vegan sausage roll launched at UK bakery Greggs in January caused a flurry of headlines and a spike in the company's profits.Meanwhile, Burger King is trialling its Impossible Whopper in 59 restaurants in the US with plans to roll them out across the country.Burger King's new veggie burger is made by Impossible Foods, which develops plant-based products that replicate both the taste and texture of real meat.Its 'secret' ingredient is heme, an iron-containing molecule that is credited by some with giving meat its 'meaty' taste.My first taste of Meet Before heading to the TED conference in Vancouver, I took a detour to a restaurant called Meet in the city's famous Gastown district.It is one of a chain of places serving Beyond Meat burgers.As a pescatarian who had not eaten meat for 20 years, this was a new challenge.At first inspection, the "meat" has the texture of the real thing but it was hard to say whether it was truly meaty, due to the amount of garnish in the burger.The restaurant was packed with diners, all of whom seemed to be enjoying the plant-based meat.Later, at TED I caught up with the company behind the burger and had another taste of their product, this time just a naked burger unadulterated with sauce or salad.It doesn't taste like Quorn - the meat alternative I am most familiar with - but it doesn't entirely taste like my memory of meat either.I enjoyed it but, as Mr Friedrich points out, I am not the target audience.How convinced meat-eaters will be, I am not so sure.Both Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat currently develop plant-based meat but there are also dozens of firms working on lab-based meat in Europe, the US, China, Japan and Israel.And regulators are beginning to understand that they need to play a part, said Mr Friedrich.In March, the US Food and Drug Administration produced a memorandum of understanding about how it would regulate the nascent industry in collaboration with the US Department of Agriculture, putting it on a more equal footing with more traditional food stuffs.In countries that have food security issues or those, like India and China, which have to feed vast populations, Mr Friedrich anticipates that regulators will "roll out the red carpet" to firms offering lab-based meat.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has flagged cellular agriculture as one of the five food technologies that could bring about real change in developing world.But not everyone will be joining the revolution.The UK's Vegan Society told the BBC: "We sympathise with the development of clean meat as it has the potential to eliminate animal suffering and reduce the environmental impacts associated with animal agriculture."We welcome any reduction in animal suffering but we can't support clean meat as animals are still used in its production - whilst these products include starter cells derived from animals, they aren't vegan."
Early ocean plastic litter traced to 1960s:::::Old-fashioned metal boxes that have been dragged around the ocean since 1931 have accidentally created a record of the history of ocean plastic.The devices - known as continuous plankton recorders (CPRs) - first ensnared a plastic bag off the coast of Ireland in 1965.This, researchers say, could be the first marine plastic litter found.The CPR record also revealed how much more plastic has been found in the ocean in recent decades.How did scientists 'accidentally' find plastic?Image copyright MBA Image caption Researchers used a piece of research equipment that was invented in the 1920s By fishing for plankton for all those decades - a key species that indicates the productivity of the ocean and so of particular interest for monitoring the health of fisheries - the machines also produced a history of plastic litter.Lead researcher Dr Clare Ostle, from Plymouth's Marine Biological Association, explained that the "fleet" of CPRs were designed and built to be towed behind ships.They capture samples of plankton from the water column - trapping them on a mesh inside.But whenever something became entangled on the recorder and had to be removed, the crew responsible for the device would record what happened, in a log."We search through [those logs] and what we realised was that we had some really early, historic entanglement cases of plastics," Dr Ostle explained."We can build a time series from that - so we can actually see the increase in larger plastic entanglements."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The metal box that accidentally discovered the history of ocean plastics.What does that timeline of ocean plastic show?One headline is that it shows what is believed to be the first recording of a plastic bag in the ocean - a bag that became ensnared on a CPR that was being towed off the coast of Ireland in 1965.Other highlights from the study include: Plastic fishing line found in 1957 Confirmation that there has been a significant and steady increase in ocean plastic since 1990 More hopefully, the number of plastic bags found in the ocean has decreased in recent years, but it's unclear whether that's related to bans and charges being introduced around the world What harm does plastic cause in the ocean?Image caption A box in the Plymouth lab contains some of the plastics entangled in the plankton recorder Marine animals can become entangled in larger plastics - particularly cord, nets and ropes.A BBC documentary crew last year filmed dead seabirds on a remote island that had starved to death with their stomachs filled with plastic fragments.Much smaller microplastics - often the product of larger items breaking down - have been found in fish, seafloor sediments and even in Antarctic ice.They remain more of an open question; scientists are investigating whether ingesting these tiny plastic fragments causes any harm.The researchers involved in this study hope that the "wave of awareness" about ocean plastic will help reduce the amount of litter that finds its way into the sea in the first place.Follow Victoria on Twitter
Stonehenge: DNA reveals origin of builders:::::Image caption Construction on Stonehenge probably began about 3,000BC The ancestors of the people who built Stonehenge travelled west across the Mediterranean before reaching Britain, a study has shown.Researchers compared DNA extracted from Neolithic human remains found across Britain with that of people alive at the same time in Europe.The Neolithic inhabitants were descended from populations originating in Anatolia (modern Turkey) that moved to Iberia before heading north.They reached Britain in about 4,000BC.Details have been published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.The migration to Britain was just one part of a general, massive expansion of people out of Anatolia in 6,000BC that introduced farming to Europe.Before that, Europe was populated by small, travelling groups which hunted animals and gathered wild plants and shellfish.One group of early farmers followed the river Danube up into Central Europe, but another group travelled west across the Mediterranean.DNA reveals that Neolithic Britons were largely descended from groups who took the Mediterranean route, either hugging the coast or hopping from island-to-island on boats.Some British groups had a minor amount of ancestry from groups that followed the Danube route.Image copyright Royal Pavilion & Museum, Brighton Image caption A facial reconstruction of Whitehawk Woman, a 5,600-year-old Neolithic woman from Sussex.The reconstruction is on show at the Royal Pavilion & Museum in Brighton When the researchers analysed the DNA of early British farmers, they found they most closely resembled Neolithic people from Iberia (modern Spain and Portugal).These Iberian farmers were descended from people who had journeyed across the Mediterranean.From Iberia, or somewhere close, the Mediterranean farmers travelled north through France.They might have entered Britain from the west, through Wales or south-west England.Indeed, radiocarbon dates suggest that Neolithic people arrived marginally earlier in the west, but this remains a topic for future work.In addition to farming, the Neolithic migrants to Britain appear to have introduced the tradition of building monuments using large stones known as megaliths.Stonehenge in Wiltshire was part of this tradition.Although Britain was inhabited by groups of "western hunter-gatherers" when the farmers arrived in about 4,000BC, DNA shows that the two groups did not mix very much at all.The British hunter-gatherers were almost completely replaced by the Neolithic farmers, apart from one group in western Scotland, where the Neolithic inhabitants had elevated local ancestry.This could have come down to the farmer groups simply having greater numbers."We don't find any detectable evidence at all for the local British western hunter-gatherer ancestry in the Neolithic farmers after they arrive," said co-author Dr Tom Booth, a specialist in ancient DNA from the Natural History Museum in London."That doesn't mean they don't mix at all, it just means that maybe their population sizes were too small to have left any kind of genetic legacy."Co-author Professor Mark Thomas, from UCL, said he also favoured "a numbers game explanation".Image copyright Channel 4/Plimsoll Productions Image caption A reconstruction of Cheddar Man.As with other Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, DNA results suggest he had dark skin and blue or green eyes Professor Thomas said the Neolithic farmers had probably had to adapt their practices to different climatic conditions as they moved across Europe.But by the time they reached Britain they were already "tooled up" and well-prepared for growing crops in a north-west European climate.The study also analysed DNA from these British hunter-gatherers.One of the skeletons analysed was that of Cheddar Man, whose skeletal remains have been dated to 7,100BC.He was the subject of a reconstruction unveiled at the Natural History Museum last year.DNA suggests that, like most other European hunter-gatherers of the time, he had dark skin combined with blue eyes.Genetic analysis shows that the Neolithic farmers, by contrast, were paler-skinned with brown eyes and black or dark-brown hair.Towards the end of the Neolithic, in about 2,450BC, the descendants of the first farmers were themselves almost entirely replaced when a new population - called the Bell Beaker people - migrated from mainland Europe.So Britain saw two extreme genetic shifts in the space of a few thousand years.Prof Thomas said that this later event happened after the Neolithic population had been in decline for some time, both in Britain and across Europe.He cautioned against simplistic explanations invoking conflict, and said the shifts ultimately came down to "economic" factors, about which lifestyles were best suited to exploit the landscape.Dr Booth explained: "It's difficult to see whether the two [genetic shifts] could have anything in common - they're two very different kinds of change.There's speculation that they're to some extent population collapses.But the reasons suggested for those two collapses are different, so it could just be coincidence."Follow Paul on Twitter.
Microplastics found in 'pristine' Pyrenees mountains:::::Image copyright Strathclyde University Image caption Researchers found the secluded area in the Pyrenees mountains was covered with airborne microplastics Scientists have found that a secluded region in the Pyrenees mountains - previously considered pristine wilderness - is covered with airborne microplastics.A team from Strathclyde and Toulouse universities spent five months in the area, which straddles France and Spain.They estimate that each day an average of 365 tiny plastic fragments or fibres settled on every square metre of land.The nearest major city - Toulouse - is about 75 miles away.Researchers collected samples from what they considered to be an uncontaminated area in south west France, about four miles from the nearest village.Samples from monitoring devices were analysed to identify whether the tiny plastic pieces, invisible to the naked eye and less than five millimetres long, were present in the mountain range.It is not known the distance microplastics can travel, but the paper, published in the Nature Geoscience journal, suggests fragments are regularly travelling distances of nearly 60 miles.Image copyright Strathclyde University Image caption Steve Allen and the team of researchers spent five months studying microplastics in the region Steve Allen, a researcher from Strathclyde University, said the research suggested microplastics were being transported by the wind.He said: "It's astounding and worrying that so many particles were found in the Pyrenees field site."It opens up the possibility that it's not only in the cities you are breathing this in, but it can travel quite some distance from the sources."Plastic litter is an increasing global issue and one of the key environmental challenges we face on global scale."Mr Allen said that researchers had yet to determine the full impact of microplastics, but that other experiments had suggested they could lead to changes in feeding and mating habits in some species.Microplastics, which are completely invisible to the naked eye, have also been detected in the oceans and aquatic life.They have been found in tap water around the world and in some of the most remote places on earth, with studies showing they have even reached Antarctica.
Seychelles president makes underwater speech calling for protection for oceans:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The President of Seychelles joined an expedition exploring the Indian Ocean The Seychelles president has gone below the surface of the Indian Ocean to call for better protection for the world's seas.Danny Faure said that a healthy ocean was "crucial for the survival of humanity" in a broadcast made 124m (406ft) below sea level.He had joined a British-led expedition exploring the ocean's depths.Last year, the Seychelles created protected areas of the ocean that were "the size of Great Britain".During the live broadcast Mr Faure could be seen in the submersible wearing a Seychelles T-shirt.He told viewers that the ocean was "the beating blue heart of our planet" and said that it was "under threat like never before.""We have managed to seriously impact this environment through climate change.I can see the incredible wildlife that needs protection.Over the years we have created these problems, we must solve them and we must solve them together."The broadcast was part of an expedition by Nekton Mission.The mission will explore deep sections of the waters surrounding the Seychelles.The goal is to gain public support for the country to protect 30% of its national waters by 2020.It will then explore other areas of the Indian Ocean ahead of a summit in Oxford in 2022.In February 2018 the Seychelles protected 210,000 sq km (81,000 sq miles) of ocean in exchange for getting some of its national debt paid off.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The island nation plans to protect 30% of its seas by 2020 The reserves limit tourism and fishing activities in the country to halt further damage to aquatic life.It was the first debt swap designed to protect ocean areas in the world.According to the UN, only 16% of marine waters under national jurisdiction are covered by protected areas.The Seychelles aims to protect 30% of its ocean space by next year.Oceans are one of the seven main themes of this year's UN climate summit in Chile in December.Small island nations like the Seychelles are among the most vulnerable to the rise in sea levels caused by climate change.
Baby boom for North Atlantic right whales off US coast:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Only about 450 North Atlantic right whales are thought to remain One of the world's most endangered whale species is experiencing a mini baby boom off the US state of Massachusetts.Researchers at the Center for Coastal Studies have announced they have seen three North Atlantic right whale mother and calf pairs in Cape Cod bay.The whales give birth off Georgia and Florida in the winter before moving up the US east coast in the spring.Only about 450 of the species are believed to remain.Scientists reportedly did not spot any right whale newborns in 2018, so researchers were elated to report the sighting of two pairs of right whales in Cape Cod bay this week.Another pair had been sighted earlier.The Scientist magazine reports that seven calves have been spotted off Florida so far this year.North Atlantic right whales were hunted virtually to extinction by the early 1890s, and have been listed as endangered since 1970.The mammals tend to stay near to coasts and have a high blubber content, making them a valuable target for whalers.It remains illegal to come within 500 yards (457 metres) of a North Atlantic right whale without a Federal Research Permit.There are three species of right whale around the world.The Southern right whale can be found throughout the southern hemisphere, and several thousand are thought to remain.But the North Pacific right whale is even rarer than its North Atlantic relative.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports there are likely fewer than 200 left.
Can you spot ocean plastic from space?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lauren Biermann: "We've been concentrating on getting the science right; the next step is automation" Scientists are working on a technique to track plastic debris in the ocean from space.It's extremely challenging, especially since the individual pieces of litter are smaller than the minimum-sized objects that satellites can resolve.But the approach works by looking for plastic's reflected light signature in the water.And early trials conducted by the UK's Plymouth Marine Laboratory have been very encouraging."You're never going to see an individual plastic bottle floating on the sea, but we can detect aggregations of this material," Dr Lauren Biermann told BBC News.Other stories from EGU 2019 Image copyright @HFiskJohnson Image caption Close up (top), the plastic is easy to see, but pull out even a little (bottom) and the challenge becomes obvious.The white box represents the size of a Sentinel pixel.The swimmer is in the bottom-left of this box The Earth observation scientist has been experimenting with the EU's Sentinel-2 satellites - a pair of orbiting multi-spectral instruments (MSI) that were launched in 2015 and 2017 and are operated by the European Space Agency (Esa).The duo's mission is primarily to make a continuously evolving map of Earth's land surfaces, but in the process they also capture a view of coastal waters.And, actually, this is the key zone of opportunity if you want to monitor plastic discharge to the ocean, because much of the eight million tonnes globally that's thought to make its way out to sea every year does so through rivers and their estuaries.In the UK, the Sentinel pair will be mapping this zone every couple of days.Image copyright Airbus Image caption Artwork: The wavelengths of light gathered by the Sentinel instruments carry a lot of information The difficulty for Dr Biermann is that the satellites have a best resolution of 10m, meaning any objects in an image will only be detectable if they make up a certain percentage of each pixel.But she has a couple of factors that work in her favour.The first is that floating debris tends to aggregate in the eddies, fronts and plumes that form as river water enters the sea.And although a lot of the time this will just be plant material, rubbish such as plastic will also be drawn in.The second factor working to Dr Biermann's advantage is simply the quality of the detectors in the Sentinel instruments.These have great clarity in the way they sense the different wavelengths that make up light.And the Plymouth scientist can use this performance to interrogate the individual pixels in a picture to see what objects they're likely to contain even if they can't be directly resolved.It works like this: seawater absorbs light strongly in the near-infrared.Plants and anything else floating in the water will reflect in the near-infrared.But plants will absorb well in the red band, whilst plastic less so.Further information can be gleaned from the "red edge" and shortwave infrared bands, also."Vegetation has a good signature that we can look for, whereas plastic has a different signature," she explained."So, we can start to un-mix the pixel and say, 'Right, how much of this pixel that I've detected that is nice and bright in my new floating debris index - how much of it seems to be plant material, and how much seems not to be plant material?'"Image caption The University of the Aegean put out plastic targets.The new index recognises the presence of plastic (left) Developing the index has involved validation work in which the Sentinels have overflown great "forests" of sargassum seaweed and even panels and bottles of plastic laid out on the water by scientists from the University of the Aegean, to get a better idea of the spectral differences between the materials.Follow-up case studies in the Strait of Georgia in British Columbia and off the east coast of Scotland have both shown promise.Dr Biermann says the technique needs refinement but believes the results from this early Esa-funded research certainly justify further investigation.One of the next phases would be to apply machine-learning algorithms to the analysis of images.Searching the pictures manually is time-consuming and ultimately not practical.Automation is the only way to go.Dr Biermann sees satellite observations being used to monitor improvements at those known river hotspots for plastic discharge.The information could also be allied to other datasets to make assessments of the pollution's impacts."If you know where your whales or dolphins or other charismatic megafauna are foraging, you want to see perhaps how much of a risk they are at from these hotspots."Dr Biermann presented her research here at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly.Image copyright Copernicus Sentinel data (2016)/Esa Image caption The Sentinels gather spectacular images of land surfaces -

Beresheet spacecraft: 'Technical glitch' led to Moon crash:::::Image copyright SpaceIL Image caption Pictures of the moon taken by Beresheet as it made its descent Preliminary data from the Beresheet spacecraft suggests a technical glitch in one of its components caused the lander to crash on the Moon.The malfunction triggered a chain of events that eventually caused its main engine to switch off.Despite a restart, this meant that the spacecraft was unable to slow down during the final stages of its descent.The Israeli spacecraft was the first privately funded probe to attempt a soft landing on the Moon.The engineering team at SpaceIL and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) said that the first technical issue occurred 14km above the lunar surface.This would have been moments after it sent a selfie of its descent.The final telemetry reading from the spacecraft revealed that 150m above the lunar surface, the spacecraft was moving at about 500km/h (300mph).At this speed a crash landing was inevitable.Image copyright Reuters Image caption One of the last photos taken by Beresheet of the moon's surface before it crashed The Beresheet scientists have not specified the faulty component, but during the descent the spacecraft's inertial measurement unit reset - this assesses the orientation and velocity of the probe.This early investigation does suggest that the main engine, which had been built in Britain, was not the primary source of the failure.Robert Westcott, a senior propulsion engineer at Nammo Westcott, said: 'It appears that a glitch, perhaps with a sensor, may have caused the on-board computer to erroneously shut down the main engine."By the time they had reset the system and the engine successfully restarted it was too late to slow the lander down for the soft landing."It looks like our engine performed nominally though."The team said more tests would be carried out next week to gain a better understanding of the events.Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) may also be able to take an image of the crash site.Follow Rebecca on Twitter.
First ever black hole image released:::::Image copyright EHT Image caption The first ever picture of a black hole: It's surrounded by a halo of bright gas Astronomers have taken the first ever image of a black hole, which is located in a distant galaxy.It measures 40 billion km across - three million times the size of the Earth - and has been described by scientists as "a monster".The black hole is 500 million trillion km away and was photographed by a network of eight telescopes across the world.Details have been published today in Astrophysical Journal Letters.It was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a network of eight linked telescopes.Prof Heino Falcke, of Radboud University in the Netherlands, who proposed the experiment, told BBC News that the black hole was found in a galaxy called M87."What we see is larger than the size of our entire Solar System," he said."It has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun.And it is one of the heaviest black holes that we think exists.It is an absolute monster, the heavyweight champion of black holes in the Universe."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Prof Heino Falcke: "We still have to understand how the light is generated" The image shows an intensely bright "ring of fire", as Prof Falcke describes it, surrounding a perfectly circular dark hole.The bright halo is caused by superheated gas falling into the hole.The light is brighter than all the billions of other stars in the galaxy combined - which is why it can be seen at such distance from Earth.The edge of the dark circle at the centre is the point at which the gas enters the black hole, which is an object that has such a large gravitational pull, not even light can escape.Image copyright DR JEAN LORRE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption Astronomers have suspected that the M87 galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its heart from false colour images such as this one.The dark centre is not a black hole but indicates that stars are densely packed and fast moving The image matches what theoretical physicists and indeed, Hollywood directors, imagined black holes would look like, according to Dr Ziri Younsi, of University College London - who is part of the EHT collaboration."Although they are relatively simple objects, black holes raise some of the most complex questions about the nature of space and time, and ultimately of our existence," he said."It is remarkable that the image we observe is so similar to that which we obtain from our theoretical calculations.So far, it looks like Einstein is correct once again."But having the first image will enable researchers to learn more about these mysterious objects.They will be keen to look out for ways in which the black hole departs from what's expected in physics.No-one really knows how the bright ring around the hole is created.Even more intriguing is the question of what happens when an object falls into a black hole.What is a black hole?A black hole is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape Despite the name, they are not empty but instead consist of a huge amount of matter packed densely into a small area, giving it an immense gravitational pull There is a region of space beyond the black hole called the event horizon.This is a "point of no return", beyond which it is impossible to escape the gravitational effects of the black hole Prof Falcke had the idea for the project when he was a PhD student in 1993.At the time, no-one thought it was possible.But he was the first to realise that a certain type of radio emission would be generated close to and all around the black hole, which would be powerful enough to be detected by telescopes on Earth.He also recalled reading a scientific paper from 1973 that suggested that because of their enormous gravity, black holes appear 2.5 times larger than they actually are.These two factors suddenly made the seemingly impossible, possible.After arguing his case for 20 years, Prof Falcke persuaded the European Research Council to fund the project.The National Science Foundation and agencies in East Asia then joined in to bankroll the project to the tune of more than 40m.Image caption The eventual EHT array will have 12 widely spaced participating radio facilities It is an investment that has been vindicated with the publication of the image.Prof Falcke told me that he felt that "it's mission accomplished".He said: "It has been a long journey, but this is what I wanted to see with my own eyes.I wanted to know is this real?"No single telescope is powerful enough to image the black hole.So, in the biggest experiment of its kind, Prof Sheperd Doeleman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics led a project to set up a network of eight linked telescopes.Together, they form the Event Horizon Telescope and can be thought of as a planet-sized array of dishes.Image copyright Katie Bouman Image caption Katie Bouman is the MIT student who developed the algorithm that pieced together the data from the EHT.Without her contribution the project would not have been possible.Image copyright Jason Gallicchio Each is located high up at a variety of exotic sites, including on volcanoes in Hawaii and Mexico, mountains in Arizona and the Spanish Sierra Nevada, in the Atacama Desert of Chile, and in Antarctica.A team of 200 scientists pointed the networked telescopes towards M87 and scanned its heart over a period of 10 days.The information they gathered was too much to be sent across the internet.Instead, the data was stored on hundreds of hard drives that were flown to central processing centres in Boston, US, and Bonn, Germany, to assemble the information.Katie Bouman a PhD student at MIT developed an algorithm that pieced together the data from the EHT.Without her contribution the project would not have been possible.Prof Doeleman described the achievement as "an extraordinary scientific feat"."We have achieved something presumed to be impossible just a generation ago," he said."Breakthroughs in technology, connections between the world's best radio observatories, and innovative algorithms all came together to open an entirely new window on black holes."The team is also imaging the supermassive black hole at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.Odd though it may sound, that is harder than getting an image from a distant galaxy 55 million light-years away.This is because, for some unknown reason, the "ring of fire" around the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way is smaller and dimmer.Follow Pallab on Twitter How to see a Black Hole: The Universe's Greatest Mystery can be seen the UK at 21:00 on BBC Four on Wednesday 10 April.
Study identifies danger glacial lakes across Tibetan Plateau:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Simon Allen: "We'd like to see this upscaled to the whole of High Mountain Asia" The flood danger posed by glacial lakes across the Tibetan Plateau has been assessed in the most comprehensive study of its kind so far.Swiss and Chinese scientists looked at 1,300 of these water bodies that have built up in front of ice streams and which are dammed by rocky debris.The fear is that these lakes can overtop their barriers and send floods downstream that overrun settlements.The team has found 210 (16%) to have the potential to threaten communities.It is information local decision-makers can now use to prioritise strategies to mitigate the risk, says Simon Allen, whose group at the University of Zurich worked alongside colleagues from the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research in Beijing."One of the key aspects of this study is that we identify important situations where lakes have developed in China, but most of the threat is downstream in Nepal, across the border," he told BBC News."We call these 'transnational boundary threats'.So, these are important because it is much more complex to manage the response of two countries."Dr Allen was speaking here at the European Geosciences Union General Assembly.Image copyright Daniel Alton Byers CC BY-SA 3.0 Image caption Lakes that get too big will sometimes be drained by local agencies He said the assessment carried out in the central Himalaya should be repeated across High Mountain Asia.There are several mechanisms that can generate a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (Glof).But one of the most common in the Tibetan region sees an ice avalanche come down the steep slope of a glacier into the lake to drive a large wave over the dam.It was the potential for just such a scenario that the team's automated satellite survey considered.But, crucially, the reality of humans actually being in the way of any flood was also taken into account."A lot of the unstable lakes are far too remote to affect people," said Dr Allen."Only 210 out of these nearly 2,000 lakes could potentially threaten human settlements.So, this is already useful information for policymakers - they can then focus on these lakes.These are the hotspots of risk."Image copyright University of Zurich Image caption The team takes a small boat to the lakes to measure their depth, and therefore a volume Top of the list of the team's 30 most dangerous lakes is Cirenmaco, which has experienced three major disasters in the past 100 years.In 1981, 200 people died in a lake outburst.Second on the list Galongco, a lake with 10 times the area of Cirenmaco.The scientists have recently been to Galongco to measure its depth, to work out a volume."These type of studies have to be repeated every five or 10 years because these lakes are growing and new lakes are formed all the time," Dr Allen told reporters at EGU."We would like this study to be replicated across High Mountain Asia - in countries like India and Pakistan - because there is a lot of money going into Glof projects, but this kind of study should be the starting point so that we're not wasting money in the wrong regions or on the wrong lakes."
Extinction Rebellion: The climate protesters who want to get arrested:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Extinction Rebellion's fight against climate change is making headlines Protest group Extinction Rebellion's fight against climate change is making headlines - most recently when they stripped almost naked in the House of Commons.The Victoria Derbyshire programme went behind the scenes with the group, which urges people to break the law to save the world."Troublemakers change the world," says Roger Hallam, one the group's founders."When they're starting to call you troublemakers, you're starting to get some traction, right?"Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible.Since its launch last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament.Critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.Mr Hallam is unrepentant: "If you're a trade union, everyone knows that when you first go on strike everyone's going, 'Troublemakers.'But then you have to state your case, which is, 'If you don't get this sorted, we're going to die.'"We filmed members as they blocked traffic in central London - playing cat and mouse with the police - and as young members glued themselves to the entrance of a fracking conference.Civil disobedience Image caption Group founder Roger Hallam says he has spent years studying how to achieve social change It has three core demands: for the government to "tell the truth about climate change", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress.Mr Hallam has spent years researching how to achieve social change through radical movements."Mass participation and civil disobedience maximise the chance of social change in this context," he explains."It doesn't mean it's guaranteed, it just means it's massively more likely to be effective than sending emails and doing conventional campaigning.And it's significantly more effective than using violence."He estimates that thousands of people will need to be arrested before the government will take notice.So far, 222 people have been arrested for offences relating to the protests."The police will go to government and say, 'We're not doing it anymore,'" says Mr Hallam."They're not there to start arresting 84-year-old grannies or 10-year-old kids, there has to be a political solution."Non-violent Image caption The group was given its office in London by a supporter The group's headquarters is in a slightly unexpected spot, the top of a corporate building in Euston which also houses a construction company and a fashion brand.It was given to them after one of their members approached a corporate landlord and said: "We're not going to be around in 10 years, let us do something about it."He gave it to them, in effect, for free.At a training event for new joiners, a debate is held on what counts as violence - Extinction Rebellion is a non-violent organisation.In a role-play exercise, they learn how to deal with angry members of the public - the people they are often obstructing during protests.They are also taught what to do when they are arrested - how to make it more difficult for police to pick them up and their legal rights once they get to the police station.Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger The Taxpayers' Alliance, which campaigns for lower taxes, says their behaviour is "clearly irresponsible and wasting police time".The group's chief executive John O'Connell said: "They should stop these juvenile actions and express themselves peaceably, and not resort to playground politics."Does Extinction Rebellion really think ruining people's day by blocking their way is going to change their minds?"Yes, it is," says Mr Hallam."The only way people change is by getting upset.No change is possible unless there's major emotional distress.And you can do that violently and non-violently... it's a no-brainer, that's how society changes."No arrests?Image caption Lorna Greenwood says traditional forms of campaigning are not working At their Downing Street demonstration, which they have called Blood of our Children because they are covering the street with fake blood, 31-year-old Lorna Greenwood is demonstrating with the group for the first time."I don't want to be standing here, six months pregnant, breaking the law," she tells the crowd."I don't want to spend my weekend in a police cell, and I don't want to be giving more work to our overstretched and undervalued police force.But I don't feel like I have any other options."In fact, there are no arrests during this demonstration - the police do not always give the group the results it hopes."The whole point is to get arrested - I've come from Manchester to get arrested," says one disappointed man.But there are journalists everywhere which is also what the group wants - the press covering them and telling people they exist.Later this month, the group plans to blockade London in its biggest action yet - it says its members will sit in the streets until politicians listen.Farhana Yamin, an international climate change lecturer and environmental lawyer, is one of the people prepared to be arrested for the cause.She explains: "I've got four kids and the eldest one, every year she gets older and I feel, 'Where's the progress?'All that time I spent as a lawyer and a professional away from her, what does that count for?"Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter -

Extinction Rebellion: What do they want and is it realistic?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Extinction Rebellion's attempts to clog the heart of London and other cities across the UK have undoubtedly driven the issue of climate change up the news agenda.But amid the die-ins - where protestors pretend to be dead - bridge swarmings and arrests, there hasn't been too much consideration of the group's actual plans to tackle rising temperatures.As a solution to the "climate breakdown and ecological collapse that threaten our existence", Extinction Rebellion is proposing three key steps.The government must, in their words, "tell the truth" about the scale of the crisis the world now faces.Secondly, the UK must enact legally binding policies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025.The third step is the formation of a Citizens' Assembly to "oversee the changes" that will be needed to achieve this goal.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Extinction Rebellion's fight against climate change is making headlines Is zero emissions by 2025 realistic?Getting to net zero carbon emissions in the UK by 2025 would be an extremely difficult target, given that, right now, the government is mulling a plan to commit to net zero by 2050.Consider the changes that would be needed to get to net zero in just six years.Gas boilers across the UK would have to be replaced with electricity, and you'd need to massively ramp up renewable energy, on a scale not yet seen, to meet this extra demand.Researchers at Zero Carbon Britain suggested that if the UK wanted to get to net zero by 2030, Britain would need about 130,000 extra wind turbines mostly off shore.This would take up an area twice the size of Wales.There would also have to be significant dietary changes, with people cutting back on meat and dairy.Image copyright Getty Images Flying would have to be restricted.Severely."You could have an air flight every couple of years, but we can't allow the world to continue flying for hen parties in New York every couple of weeks," said Paul Allen who co-ordinates the Zero Carbon Britain research project."The numbers don't stack up.We can't do this, we have to be honest with ourselves."What would need to change to get to zero in six years?Achieving net zero five years earlier than the Zero Carbon Britain plan would be an unprecedented challenge, akin to a wartime situation.It would not be impossible but it would depend on a fierce political commitment."The honest answer about whether you can hit net zero by 2025 is that until you go for it, nobody knows if you'll get there," said Andrew Simms from the Rapid Transition Alliance, which promotes solutions to climate change that could transform the world over the next 12 years."We tend to forget what can be achieved in really compressed periods of time when the whole of industry and the whole of government put their minds to it."It's like the speed with which we responded to the financial crisis in 2008.Image copyright Getty Images "If we treated the wellbeing of the biosphere with the same integrity and seriousness with which we treated the integrity of the banking system you would rapidly see the alignment of resources and planning that would achieve these kind of goals."Those involved with Extinction Rebellion say that the nature of the climate crisis is such that even large-scale carbon cutting plans just won't be enough."This is not the time to be realistic, this is the time for humanity to completely change course," said Dr Gail Bradbrook, a co-founder of the organisation."This is not about fiddling around the edges, and adding a few solar panels to a few roofs; we have left it so late that we have to step up in a semi-miraculous way to deal with this situation."Who is going to make the tough decisions on emissions cuts?Extinction Rebellion says that the key elements of their plan to get the UK to net zero will be set by a Citizens Assembly, composed of people representatively selected from across Britain."Let's have people decide what matters most to them, is it the health and safety and the ability to feed their own kids or does it matter to them that they carry on having holidays and meat?""We need Joe the bus driver and Frances the hairdresser to get their heads around it," said Dr Bradbrook.Supporters of this approach point to Ireland as a country that has embraced the Citizens Assembly idea to tackle difficult societal questions.The Assembly considered the question of Ireland's restrictions on abortion and suggested that a referendum be held to remove the ban.The significant majority that supported repeal indicated that Assembly was an accurate barometer of public opinion.On climate change, Ireland's Assembly has also been an advocate of strong action, with big majorities favouring higher taxes on carbon-intensive activities among a number of recommendations.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Protestors in the Netherlands pretend to be dead during a climate protest This in turn gave real political impetus to the establishment of a parliamentary committee on climate action."This led this committee to issue what is the strongest cross-party political statement of intent on climate action," said John Gibbons, an Irish environmental writer and commentator."It certainly has its weaknesses, but Ireland is, in the Taoiseach's own words, an international laggard on tackling climate change, so this report is a good deal better than expected."Mr Gibbons points out that despite the actions of the Citizens Assembly and politicians, the country is way off target when it comes to cutting carbon."Huge compliance penalties are due to kick in post-2020, making ongoing inaction expensive as well as embarrassing for Ireland," he says.Is there political momentum behind drastic cuts?The government has to uphold UK law on climate change, that mandates a series of emissions cuts over time.Extinction Rebellion believes that many politicians want to go much further.They say that political forces are happy to see their protestors on the streets, disrupting traffic and transport.It believes the group is creating the space for a joined-up approach among politicians that has been absent until now."We've just got to get away from these left-right political fights - this is beyond that.I want to see people sitting in a room and bringing the solutions and being real together and saying how do we get out of this?"said Gail Bradbrook."It'll bring the best out of ourselves through that process."Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger
Plastic toys: Is it time we cut back?:::::Image copyright Bettina Maidment Piles of plastic toys take up space in many family homes in the UK.If you're a parent, then you'll know how tricky it can be to avoid buying them, whether it's diggers, dolls houses or building bricks.The UK's toy industry is massive -

things like toy libraries, passing toys on, buying less, borrowing off friends and sharing more.Greenpeace UK told the BBC it doesn't count plastic toys as 'single-use plastics' as they can be used time and time again."Toys are far from single use plastics, as we know from research that they stay within a household for approximately 10 years and tend to then be passed on to charities, friends and families," Natasha Crookes from the British Toy and Hobby Association says.The organisation claims many toys will last between 15-20 years before they enter the waste stream.Making toys out of recycled plastic might not be the answer either."Recycled plastics are rarely able to be used in the process of manufacturing toys due to the uncertainty of the chemical composition of recycled plastic," Natasha says."It could contain one of the thousands of chemicals restricted under toy safety legislation."'It's all about buying good quality toys' Avoiding plastic altogether and buying toys out of sustainable materials could be the answer.There are loads of new eco-style brands that offer toys made from sustainable wood and recycled materials.But they can be expensive.Mum-of-two Rachel Lochhead says she tries to stay away from plastic toys if she can help it and only buys "good quality" toy brands new so she knows they will last a long time.Image copyright Rachel Lochhead Image caption Rachel tries to buy good quality toys that will last Rachel says she does buy some plastic toys but only second hand ones - mainly from Ebay or Gumtree and charity shops."Plastic is a practical material and cheap to manufacture so inevitably lots of things are made from it."'Buying second hand saves me loads of money' Bettina Maidment tries to live a plastic-free life.When it comes to toys though, she says she still buys plastic, but only second-hand.Image copyright Bettina Maidment Image caption Bettina Maidment says she never buys brand new toys for her two boys "For the last two Christmases I've done a second-hand Christmas - I save quite a lot of money that way."My son got a bike for his birthday which we couldn't afford brand new, but second-hand it was like new and he loves it."It's not just online auction sites that have grown in popularity when it comes to reselling toys, parents often post ads on social media groups offering up toys for free or a small price.How safe is it to buy second-hand toys?There have been some concerns about the health risks of buying second-hand toys.Last year a study found some toys tested didn't meet the most up-to-date safety guidelines.Mark Gardiner, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said: "Any goods that are bought second-hand are not going to have the same safety assurances."Parents should weigh up these risks, especially when giving their children toys that are very old and could have also mechanically deteriorated over time."What are the toy companies doing about plastic?Whilst consumers are taking steps to reuse or recycle toys, green campaigners say it's up to manufacturers and retailers to act.Some toy companies are taking steps to become more sustainable.Image copyright LEGO Image caption Lego's leaves, bushes and trees are made from plastic sourced from sugarcane Lego's leaves, bushes and trees are now actually green - they're made with plastic sourced from sugarcane.It's part of the Danish company's pledge to use sustainable materials in its products and packaging by 2030.Toy company MGA Entertainment, which is behind L.O.L Surprise!, is trying to cut back on the waste produced from packaging its dolls.Consumers are invited to box the waste up, request and print a label from the website, before sending it off to TerraCycle for recycling.How easy is it to recycle plastic toys?Rather than chucking out an old plastic train set if it's damaged, it's worth checking with your local recycling centre if they'll take it.Plastic toys and games can't be collected as part of your household recycling scheme, according to the Recycle Now campaign group."If your toys and games are beyond repair, it may still be possible to recycle some of the parts if you dismantle them - and this includes batteries and battery packs from remote controls which should be removed and recycled."

India eco-school: Is this the greenest campus on Earth?:::::Image caption The school's surrounding mountainous landscape is almost devoid of vegetation as it is above the tree line Secmol is a school pioneering practical green education in one of the world's harshest environments.Its campus is perched nearly 11,000ft (3,350m) up in the pre-Himalayan mountains along the Indus River in Ladakh, in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.The teenage pupils at Secmol (Students' Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh) lack wi-fi and almost all phone coverage, in an area only accessible by air during the long harsh winter when deep snow renders roads out of the province impassable.The surrounding mountainous landscape is almost devoid of vegetation as it is above the tree line.Image copyright Sumedh Chaphekar The school even sets its own time zone to maximise sunlight, which also reminds every student and visitor that when they pass the gates they are entering a different world.Pupils are all from the regular Ladakhi school system and only those who have failed their year 10 exams are permitted to attend.There are also a number of university students who form a core part of the community along with the teachers.School director Konchok Norgay explained to the BBC that the students learn about the environment for an hour or two each day.In a typical maths lesson, they may calculate if the water from the spring is enough for tree planting, or work out the efficiency of the solar cooker that they use for heating water.The solar cooker looks impressive, with mirrors crafted to catch the harsh sunlight, focusing their power to create intense heat.But it is currently only used to boil water for tea.Norgay proudly showed off his experimental biogas methane digester, which is powered by slurry.Dung is mixed with water and then placed in a long tube and left for several days.The gas rises to the top, and is filtered through steel wool to ensure the gas does not corrode the oven, before reaching a plastic inflatable reserve tank."It's fantastic as not only do you use less commercial gas, but you use natural materials instead," student Stanzin Sungrab says."And we can use the slurry waste as fertiliser in the kitchen garden."Each student must perform daily responsibility shifts and develop their confidence with nightly presentations to the rest of the school and visitors.Stanzin has spent many hours developing relationships with Karjama, Thotkar and Sheyma, the campus cows.When students are not on the 04:00 breakfast preparation shift, the day starts at 07:00 with a seven-minute group meditation.Students are encouraged to focus on goals for the day over a meal of cold roti bread and homemade apricot jam.The apricot stones are sent to a neighbouring monastery, where the kernels are recycled into apricot oil.Innovation is hard-wired into the architecture of the campus, challenged by an environment where winter temperatures typically reach -15C to -25C, and summer can often peak at 30C.Ladakh has longstanding environmental credentials - even if the recent sprouting of large concrete hotels and increasing pollution in the capital Leh are challenging its green record."We banned plastic bags here 30 years ago," says Sonam Gatso, who operates a local green organisation.Sonam also believes local Buddhist culture helps promote environmental awareness."We try to be compassionate as we believe in Karma - cause-and-effect.If you do wrong to anyone else or the environment, wrong will come to you."Secmol is an impressive school, but how far can its lessons extend beyond its innovative but isolated campus?Urgain Nurbu, a former Secmol student who is now living on campus again, has been so inspired by what he learnt that he organised an environmental youth camp in his remote village.The camp-goers make rain jackets from old plastic, and Urgain invites environmental speakers to inspire the young people.One graduate has started her own eco-travel company, another makes environmentally-themed films.Shara, an architectural student, is now experimenting with creating pre-fabricated building blocks from mud, wood shavings and straw.She is part of a team designing a new university in the area which plans to teach eco-tourism and green architecture, scaling the influence of ideas nurtured in Secmol's pioneering atmosphere.For now, the school's impact is achieved by transforming individual mindsets to create a sense of shared responsibility."My grandfather told me how quiet and beautiful our village used to be and there were fish in the river," student Padma Doma told the BBC."That's why it's so important to me to protect our precious environment.In the future, maybe it can be like that again."I want to go home and convince my family to segregate their garbage.Will they listen?Perhaps not, but I will try, and if I see somebody throwing away a packet, I will pick it up."Stanzin feels this is "a really critical time for our planet"."In our homes we throw away garbage but here we recycle.In our homes we throw away plastic but here we use it for insulation."As the environment is so harsh, Ladakhis are very conscious of subtle changes in the weather, and have become increasingly aware of climate change, he says."Last year, we didn't have much snow so there's not enough snowmelt in the springtime.Because we are so high up and everything must be treasured, you learn to understand the value of the smallest drop of water."All photos Emily Kasriel unless indicated.Subject to copyright.
Tasmanian devils 'adapting to coexist with cancer':::::Image copyright Getty Images There's fresh hope for the survival of endangered Tasmanian devils after large numbers were killed off by facial tumours.The world's largest carnivorous marsupials have been battling Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) for over 20 years.But researchers have found the animals' immune system to be modifying to combat the assault.And according to an international team of scientists from Australia, UK, US and France, the future for the devils is now looking brighter."In the past, we were managing devil populations to avoid extinction.Now, we are progressively moving to an adaptive management strategy, enhancing those selective adaptations for the evolution of devil/DFTD coexistence," explains Dr Rodrigo Hamede, from the University of Tasmania.First discovered in north-eastern Tasmania in 1996, the disease has since spread across 95% of the species' range, with local population losses of over 90%.Dr Hamede's team has been collecting epidemiological evidence over the past 10 years.The group has plotted scenarios based on current infection rates in the wild, and in their forecast for the next 100 years, 57% of scenarios see DFTD fading out and 22% predict coexistence.Image copyright Dr Max Stammnitz Image caption Tumours can become as large as half the size of the face How does the disease spread?The disease is transmitted when devils bite each other's faces during fights.The biting behaviour is a way to socialise and assert dominance which, alongside the growl-like screams, helped earn the devils their nickname."Our current hypothesis is that the biting doesn't only lead to the spread of tumours but it might be the starting point," explains Max Stammnitz, from the University of Cambridge, UK, who sequences tumour genomes."If the scarring processes for the recurring wounds are interrupted by a mutation, this might become cancerous.It fails to heal and starts to grow out into an external tissue that may then become transmissible," Mr Stammnitz says.Image copyright Getty Images After the bite, a solid tumour then grows around the face or neck, with the power to break bones in the jaw - killing the animal after 6 to 24 months.To worsen the crisis, in 2014, a second transmissible cancer (DFT2) was discovered in wild populations in the south of the island."A second transmissible tumour in devils was extremely surprising, like lightning striking the devils twice," says Dr Hamede.But in the last 5-6 years, some devils have developed higher tolerance to infection and even resistance without human intervention, meaning that while population numbers have not recovered to pre-DFTD numbers, the decline has at least now levelled out.Image copyright Max Stammnitz Image caption DFTD can displace teeth or protrude through the eyes and nostrils of the animal How is natural selection helping?"Natural selection is trying to fix the problem on its own by favouring those who can survive the tumour, so we're more hopeful these days than ever before," explains Dr Hamede.The international team monitors eight sites across the east, south and west of the island every three months, observing multiple generations of devils."We have witnessed how these tumours shape the ecology of devils and how they have been evolving with their hosts in real time," Dr Hamede says.Devils can now adapt to the transmissible cancer at the genetic and phenotypic levels - meaning the DNA and characteristics of the gene traits.This is due to their phenotypic plasticity - the capacity of an individual organism to alter its physiology or gene expression in response to changing environmental conditions.And what's even more unique is how rapidly this has happened - in a matter of 16 years, over just eight devil generations.Image copyright Manuel Ruiz Aravena Image caption In some animals, tumours (inset) have completely regressed without any human intervention "It's a constant arms race of adaptation between animals and diseases.We develop mechanisms of resistance which put pressure on pathogens to improve infection," Mr Stammnitz says.The first of these mechanisms is tolerance and the second is resistance.The team has found devils that have lived for up to two years with the disease, allowing for two more litters to serve as population recruitment for the disease.In addition, 23 cases of tumour regression have been found so far - showing devils also have the capacity to fight and recover from DFTD.Image copyright Max Stammnitz Image caption To study the animals, the researchers must first catch them What is the future for the devils?The second largest threat to devils is roadkill, with a minimum of 350-450 devils killed each year according to Dr Fox from Save the Tasmanian Devil Programme (STDP).Targeting hotspots, the STDP has installed fencing which sounds an alarm and warns wildlife of approaching cars.The current trial has led to a 50% reduction in roadkill since 2015.The number of devils hit has dropped by a quarter and Tasmanian pademelons and Bennett's wallabies have also benefited.Image copyright Max Stammnitz Image caption Humane traps are used by the team The government has also been trialling a new app since July that members of the public can use to report sightings to help monitor populations.So far, the app has been downloaded by over 2,000 users who have entered 6,000 reports."When we tracked the start of DFTD in 2003, road kill reports by the public informed our knowledge of where it had spread showing the power of citizen science to help the devils," Dr Fox adds.In the curious case of the Tasmanian devil, there is much still to be learned about cancer biology and the evolutionary arms-race between malignant cells and their hosts.The sheer speed of the decline has created a strong selective pressure on the world's largest remaining carnivorous marsupial but it now seems hope could lie in co-existence.
'Mission Jurassic' dinosaur hunt to get under way:::::Image copyright The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Image caption Exploratory work has already identified bones from some very big dinosaurs British scientists are about to undertake one of their biggest dinosaur hunts in decades.They are joining US and Dutch institutions in exploring what is expected to be a treasure trove of fossils in the "Badlands" of Wyoming.The US state has yielded some of the most famous specimens ever found, and the international group will excavate one square mile (260ha) of ground."It's an incredible site, mind-blowing," said Prof Phil Manning."In the UK, we rarely see anything like this - whole dinosaurs coming out of the ground.But that's what we've got here," the University of Manchester palaeontologist told BBC News."And the funding we have in place permits us to open up football pitch-sized areas at a time, if need be."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Maidment and Prof Barrett: "New animals that no-one's ever seen before" The partners on the project are The Children's Museum of Indianapolis; the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden, Netherlands; and London's Natural History Museum.Prof Manning and Manchester colleague Dr Victoria Egerton are Extraordinary Scientists in Residence at the Children's Museum and will act as lead researchers, but such is the scale of this endeavour that a team of more than 100 experts will be required.The project has been dubbed "Mission Jurassic" - a reference to the major geological period in which the rocks to be studied were laid down.Image copyright The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Image caption The Children's Museum has leased one square mile of Wyoming ranch land for the project In this particular part of North Wyoming, the scientists will get access to a unit, or formation, known as the Morrison."These were deposited from about 157 million to 145 million years ago," explained the NHM's Dr Susannah Maidment."The formation has been extensively studied to the south, producing all of your favourite dinosaurs that you could name when you were seven - the likes of Stegosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Brontosaurus and Allosaurus.But we'll be in the north, which has been much less studied, and which it's suggested might hold slightly different creatures."So we're hoping to find animals that have never been seen before."Image copyright The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Image caption The site will likely keep scientists occupied for the next 20 years Already, there have been some exploratory investigations in the area.This early work, carried out by Prof Manning and colleagues, has merely heightened the anticipation.Several tonnes of bones were recovered, including fossils from two giant sauropod dinosaurs - a 24m-long Brachiosaurus and a 30m-long Diplodocus."We've got chicken-sized theropods as well," said Prof Manning, of the familiar bipedal dinosaurs out of which modern birds are descended."I'm hoping if we can find more of this material, we might learn something about the evolution of flight."Image copyright The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Image caption The Indianapolis institution is the world's largest children's museum The dig team will work through a range of ancient environments, including a river and floodplain setting; and another that appears to record a marine history."So, this is not just about dinosaurs," said the NHM's Prof Paul Barrett."Obviously, they're the charismatic creatures, but we're also interested in everything that's living alongside the dinosaurs, to build up a complete picture of that ecosystem.Things like ancient crocodiles, lizards, turtles, fish, clams, plants - we'll be taking specialists with us so we can delve deeply into that picture."Prof Barrett said Mission Jurassic was the largest expedition of its type for the NHM since a venture in Niger in the 1980s.The institution - as the UK's premier fossil display centre - hopes many of the specimens that are discovered can be brought to London.Although the NHM has an extraordinary collection of fossils, it concedes that its North American compilation could be stronger.One excellent opportunity the project will afford is educational - both for UK PhD students, who will be able to work in the field; but also for the public.There are plans to livestream events around the digs so that people can get a first-hand insight of what it's like to discover fossils that are totally new to science.Image copyright The Children's Museum of Indianapolis Image caption The areas investigated so far have some impressive dinosaur tracks Anyone wishing to follow the project should keep an eye on the Dinosaur Hub on the Natural History Museum's website.Progress will also be signal on social media with the hashtag #MissionJurassic.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
Climate change: How green is your parcel?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It's Friday lunchtime and you've found the perfect dress for that party on Saturday night but you're stuck at your desk.No problem, because after a couple of clicks, it's in your basket and on its way to your home.This is the joy of online shopping, and our love of it continues to grow.In 2017, online sales increased by 15.9% to 59.8bn in comparison with 2016, while in-store sales saw a jump of only 2.4%.But what price does getting something this fast cost the environment?Green campaigners argue our demand for getting something delivered at speed - whether it's Amazon Prime or Premier Delivery on ASOS - is adding to carbon emissions.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Online sales increased by 15.9% in 2017 in comparison with the previous year "Transport is responsible for a huge chunk of the UK's carbon emissions and the levels are actually increasing," Muna Suleiman from Friends of the Earth says."Delivery companies are a significant part of this."We've seen some good progress on use of cleaner vehicles such as cargo bikes and electric vans, but we really need to see green deliveries becoming the norm."How are delivery companies reducing emissions?Each year, the Royal Mail delivers around 1.8 billion parcels - by foot, bicycle and gas guzzling vehicles.The company says it's committed to reducing its carbon emissions further.This week, Royal Mail is introducing eight e-trikes into its fleet.Image copyright Royal Mail Image caption E-trikes are powered by a combination of pedal and battery power The vehicles are powered by a combination of pedal and battery power and will be used to make deliveries by posties in Cambridge, Sutton Coldfield and Stratford in London.It's part of a six-month trial and if successful could see the scheme extended."Our e-trikes are zero emission vehicles," David Gold, Royal Mail's director of public affairs and policy, explains."The 48v lithium battery is charged overnight by mains power but is supplemented by solar panels on the roof of the vehicle."Regenerative braking also helps to power the bike."Image copyright Royal Mail Image caption The electric trikes will deliver parcels in Cambridge, Sutton Coldfield and Stratford in London Royal Mail already has a fleet of 100 electric vehicles and has announced plans to expand it."We have the largest 'feet on the street' network of 90,000 postmen and women, and we have reduced carbon emissions by 29% since 2005, but we want to find even more environmentally friendly ways to deliver to 30 million homes across the UK," David Gold adds.Next month, an Ultra Low Emission Zone will be introduced in central London to try and reduce air pollution.It means some of the most-polluting vehicles will be charged for entering the city centre.The government wants other towns and cities to follow the capital's lead, and many delivery companies say they're already prepared for it.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption On 8 April an Ultra Low Emission Zone is introduced in central London Investing in 'greener' alternatives Yodel is one of them.It says it's making "significant investments" to reduce its carbon footprint.It delivers around 145 million parcels each year in the UK - in its peak period it says it delivers around one million a day."We have invested in technology to calculate the most efficient routes and evaluate our drivers' driving style to further reduce our carbon footprint," Yodel's CEO Andrew Peeler says."We've been working with cycle couriers in a number of towns for many years and are introducing electric to our fleet this Spring, while also trialling compressed natural gas powered trucks."DPD says it's changing the vehicles it uses in the future too.The company normally orders one thousand diesel Mercedes Sprinter vans every year, but says it's now only going to purchase electric in future.Image copyright DPD Image caption DPD says it will only purchase electric vehicles in the future It's already got three all-electric micro-depots and is aiming to have eight in London.In a statement DPD said: "We see ourselves at the forefront of this technology but can only go as fast as the vehicle manufacturers allow."Hermes is also going down the electric vehicle route - at the moment it's got 32 electric vans operating in London.Additionally, the company, which delivers 335 million parcels in the UK each year, claims to be the first in the market to use bio methane fuel to power 30 vehicles.It says it's placed the largest opening order of thirty Compressed Natural Gas tractor units after a year-long trial.The vehicles now make up nearly 20% of the 166 tractor units in the fleet.Image copyright Hermes Image caption Hermes has 32 electric vans operating in London Delivery companies 'need to go further' Although delivery companies are starting to make changes, some critics say they need to do more."We need to see delivery companies switch their entire fleet of vehicles to ones powered by clean energy," Doug Parr, chief scientist for Greenpeace UK, says."To be truly clean, these would need to be charged by renewable power rather than fossil fuel."It's not just about how the vehicles are powered though."It's essential they're constructed in a way that keeps their environmental footprint as small as possible, and so that their components can be re-used and recycled at the end of their lives," Doug says."If an electric car were manufactured and used where the main source of energy was coal this would seriously dent its green credentials."The campaign group also says it wants to see more bicycles and e-bikes used to reduce emissions and pollution.'I'd never considered my fashion carbon footprint' Hannah Morgan admits she was addicted to shopping online.She'd spend up to 9,000 a year buying clothes online - returning most of them.Image copyright Hannah Morgan Image caption Hannah's decided to stop buying clothes to cut her carbon emissions "I knew I was likely to return 80% - 100% of my order, and with free delivery and convenient time-slots to choose from, my online shopping addiction felt harmless."At no point had I considered the carbon footprint of each of my orders."Hannah gave up buying clothes online at the start of 2019 after watching Stacey Dooley's latest documentary on fast fashion."I was in shock over the environmental impact the fashion industry is having, while simultaneously trawling through my ASOS app unconsciously adding things to my basket, ready for instant purchase and free next day delivery."Hannah has tried to stop the temptation of buying by deleting shopping apps and unsubscribing to all marketing emails."It's early days but I'm enjoying seeing things differently and am hopefully making a small but positive impact in the process."Campaigners say consumers don't have to take drastic action like Hannah in order to cut emissions."By choosing companies using greener delivery methods you can show that the consumer demand to cut emissions is there", Muna Suleiman from Friends of the Earth, says."If you have a 'click and collect' location within walking distance of your home or work this can also cut down on the number of miles driven by each van."What about the big online retailers?Whilst Amazon doesn't directly deliver its parcels, it has recently committed to make "all Amazon shipments net zero carbon, with 50% of all shipments net zero by 2030".In a statement it says: "With improvements in electric vehicles, aviation bio fuels, reusable packaging, and renewable energy, for the first time we can now see a path to net zero carbon delivery of shipments to customers."But Doug Parr from Greenpeace UK says companies like Amazon could impose "stricter standards" on the delivery firms they use."Responsibility for this goes right up the chain of command - Amazon is generating the business so Amazon should be asking how its delivery agents are making those deliveries clean."If they wanted to impose standards they could."Is click and collect the answer?Whilst our appetite for online shopping is in no way declining, click-and-collect services could be one way to cut emissions.Image copyright Alamy Customers collect the goods at a local shop or designated pick-up point, like a newsagent or garage, when it's convenient for them.It's not just convenient for the consumer but with deliveries going to one place, emissions are instantly reduced.However, it could be entirely counter productive, if the customer takes their diesel or petrol car to pick that parcel up.
Bloodhound Diary: Back on track:::::Image copyright BLOODHOUND LSR We're back!Like a phoenix from the ashes, Bloodhound has risen anew, looking better than ever.After 10 years of cutting-edge research and development, building and testing the world's most advanced straight-line racing car, the old Bloodhound company finally ran out of money at the end of last year.Despite some serious commercial interest in the project, the stop-start nature of sponsorship funding finally did us in.What we really needed to find was an investor who could underwrite the cashflow between sponsorship deals... With literally just a few days left before Bloodhound went to the scrap yard, a lovely Yorkshireman called Ian Warhurst stepped forward and bought the car.It was the middle of December last year when Ian turned up with the best Christmas present ever - a supersonic future for Bloodhound!Ian is a mechanical engineer and, having just taken early retirement after selling his business, was looking for something to keep him busy.A new World Land Speed Record seemed like just the thing.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Ian Warhurst: "My kids kept saying I should buy a fast car, so I bought the fastest" The new team is called Bloodhound LSR (for Land Speed Record, of course) and the look of the car has been totally changed by its striking new red and white colour scheme.The first time I spoke to Ian, he asked me what colour I thought the car should be.I suggested some strong primary colours, such as red or blue, which would stand out against the dried mud surface of the desert track.Almost as an afterthought, I mentioned that a base colour of white would also be OK, as it was the best colour to keep the car cool in the sunshine, but it wouldn't be my first choice.I'm SO glad that he didn't listen - the white looks just terrific.Image caption Cool and good-looking So what happens now?Very sensibly, Ian has broken the new "operational" phase of Bloodhound's life into two distinct parts.The first target is to set a new World Land Speed Record (currently standing at 763mph), after which we can review the results and make a plan to attack Bloodhound's ultimate goal of 1,000mph.In preparation for our first target of a new record around 800mph, we want to take the existing car out to South Africa to conduct some high-speed testing."High speed" in this context is anywhere north of 400mph to 500mph, which will allow us to assess aerodynamic performance, measure the interaction of the solid metal wheels with the dry lakebed/desert surface, test and develop the parachute braking systems, and so on.The next obvious question is when will this happen?Ian's simple answer is: "As soon as possible!"The first task is to complete the move into our new home at SGS Berkeley Green University Technical College, which is near Gloucester.The car moved into the modestly titled "UK Land Speed Record Centre" last week (the video is here if you haven't seen it already), so Mark Chapman and his engineering team can begin preparing for high-speed running pretty much straight away.However, there are lots of other things to sort out before we can fix a date for the tests.The track in South Africa is in excellent condition and mostly ready to go.After nearly a decade of work by the local community, under the direction of the Northern Cape Provincial Government, Hakskeen Pan offers us the best-prepared high-speed racing surface in history.Now we have to complete all of the paperwork to use government-owned land in someone else's country.As part of this, we need to provide evidence that we can run the car safely without damaging the local environment.It will help that we've done this before, even if it was over 20 years ago!Moving day The South Africans are very keen to get Bloodhound out there on its new track, so they will do everything they can to get the paperwork completed quickly.In some cases, we should be able to use the paperwork we've prepared previously just by changing the name to "Bloodhound LSR", but I'm sure it won't all be that easy.Equally important is all of the export paperwork.It's no real surprise that exporting state-of-the-art military equipment (like our Rolls-Royce jet engine) attracts a lot of attention from the organisations who control that sort of thing.While the regulations controlling international arms shipments were never drafted with the Land Speed Record in mind, we are using military-spec hardware, so they still apply to us!Image copyright BLOODHOUND LSR Once all the paperwork is sorted, we can get the car out to Hakskeen Pan and start doing the high-speed testing.For the first batch of high-speed tests, the car will be jet-powered, using a Rolls-Royce EJ200 engine as found in the RAF's Typhoon jet fighters.Without the additional assistance from the Nammo hybrid rocket system (still under development), this jet-only car will not reach supersonic speeds in the 10-12 miles available on Hakskeen pan, but it will easily reach our target of 400mph to 500mph (and maybe a little faster!)during testing.With Bloodhound back on track for a new Land Speed Record, we're all hugely excited about the future.SGS Berkeley Green UTC is an ideal new home for us and the car looks great in its new colour scheme, which is generating a lot of commercial interest in the future of the project.Now our task looks fairly clear.As our new owner Ian Warhurst put it: "It's my ambition to let Bloodhound off the leash and see just how fast it can go."Bring it on.
The woman who doesn't feel pain:::::Image copyright Peter Jolly/REX/Shutterstock Jo Cameron only realises her skin is burning when she smells singed flesh.She often burns her arms on the oven, but feels no pain to warn her.That's because she is one of only two people in the world known to have a rare genetic mutation.It means she feels virtually no pain, and never feels anxious or afraid.It wasn't until she was 65 she realised she was different - when doctors couldn't believe she didn't need painkillers after a serious operation.When she had surgery on her hand, doctors warned her she should expect pain afterwards.Image copyright Jo Cameron Image caption Jo Cameron (left) was 65 when she realised she was different When she felt nothing, her anaesthetist - Dr Devjit Srivastava - sent her to pain geneticists at University College London (UCL) and Oxford University.After tests, they found gene mutations which meant that she did not feel pain like most people.Not just 'incredibly healthy' Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The woman who feels no pain Jo, from Whitebridge, near Inverness, told the BBC Scotland news website that doctors didn't believe her when she said she wouldn't need pain relief after surgery.She said: "We had banter before theatre when I guaranteed I wouldn't need painkillers."When he found I hadn't had any, he checked my medical history and found I had never asked for painkillers."That's when she was referred to specialists in England.Image copyright Jo Cameron Image caption Jo, pictured here with her husband and mother, didn't realise she was different Once diagnosed, Jo realised that she wasn't just "incredibly healthy", as she'd believed.She said: "Looking back, I realise I hadn't needed painkillers, but if you don't need them you don't question why you don't."You are what you are, until someone points it out you don't question it.I was just a happy soul who didn't realise there was anything different about me."She didn't even feel pain during childbirth, recalling: "It was just strange, but I didn't have pain.It was quite enjoyable really."Jo does the Scotch Bonnet chilli challenge Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Along with her husband Jim and her anaesthetist Dr Devjit Srivastava, Jo took part in a chilli challenge.While the two men react to the heat of the chilli, Jo keeps smiling - unfazed by the spice.Jo wouldn't change anything, but thinks pain is important and says: "Pain is there for a reason, it warns you - you hear alarm bells."It would be nice to have warning when something's wrong - I didn't know my hip was gone until it was really gone, I physically couldn't walk with my arthritis."Doctors believe she might also be able to heal more quickly than normal.This particular combination of genes also makes her forgetful and less anxious."It's called the happy gene or forgetful gene.I have been annoying people by being happy and forgetful all my life - I've got an excuse now," she said.Could Jo's genes hold the key to helping others?Jo said recently she had a "minor bump" in the car, but was unmoved by what many would have found an upsetting experience."I don't have adrenalin.You should have that warning, it's part of being human, but I wouldn't change it."The other driver, she said, was "shaking like anything", but she was able to stay calm."I don't get that reaction... it's not brave, the fear just doesn't happen."The researchers say it's possible there are more people like Jo."One out of two patients after surgery today still experiences moderate to severe pain, despite all advances in pain killer medications.It remains to be seen if any new treatments could be developed based on our findings," said Dr Srivastava."The findings point towards a novel painkiller discovery that could potentially offer post-surgical pain relief and also accelerate wound healing.We hope this could help the 330 million patients who undergo surgery globally every year."You might also like: Jo's case is the subject of a paper published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia, written by Dr Srivastava and Dr James Cox, of UCL.Dr Cox said: "People with rare insensitivity to pain can be valuable to medical research as we learn how their genetic mutations impact how they experience pain, so we would encourage anyone who does not experience pain to come forward."We hope that with time, our findings might contribute to clinical research for post-operative pain and anxiety, and potentially chronic pain, PTSD and wound healing."
Sustainable students: How easy is it to be more environmentally-friendly?:::::Image caption Helen, Will and their four housemates took on the challenge Student housemates from Loughborough University have been challenged to live more sustainably, with weekly challenges set by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.How did they get on?Plastics challenge The students were challenged to reduce their plastic use by 75%, which they found difficult."It's hard when you're on a student budget, getting anything not wrapped in plastic is so much more expensive," Amy explained.Plastics guru Lucy Siegle gave them a helping hand, swapping their countless shower bottles for sustainable versions of shampoo, toothpaste and soap bars.She also gave them reusable items like coffee cups and cutlery and told them to change their shopping habits.Image caption Amy Fitzgerald and Jay Maheswaran were tasked with reducing their use of plastics But Amy said they found supermarkets a particular problem as "everything was wrapped in plastic"."And going to the butcher's was more expensive than getting pre-packaged stuff," she added.At the start of the week, Ms Siegle weighed the plastic in the students' home, which totalled 2.8lb (1.3kg) - a figure she described as "rather a lot".With her advice, the students reduced it to 1.5lb.Image caption Ms Siegle was not pleased with the house's reliance on clingfilm, and confiscated their roll "I'm still really pleased with them," she said."Especially as when I saw all the bottles they [initially] had in their bathroom, I nearly gave up."Ms Siegle said she thought the group had adopted the mindset shift really quickly, experiencing outrage over everything being plastic.She urged them to be more militant by unwrapping products at the supermarket checkout and leaving the plastic behind to make the point."We need to take a stand," she said.Fashion challenge Marcus Rudd, one of the housemates, had hoped that his shopping habits - buying 10 to 15 T-shirts a year, combined with some designer pieces - were environmentally friendly.Then he learned that it took 3,000 litres of water on average to make only one T-shirt.The fashion industry - which makes 100 billion garments each year - is a major contributor to greenhouse gases, water pollution, air pollution and the overuse of water.Image caption Marcus was won over by charity and vintage shops, picking out this striking jacket It is exacerbated, MPs say, by so-called "fast fashion" - inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers.Sustainable stylist Alice Wilby taught the students to reuse, repair and recycle, encouraging them to swap fast fashion for second-hand.She challenged Marcus and his housemate Goby Chan, who regularly buys clothes she does not wear, to make a new outfit from old clothes to model at London Fashion Week."We buy so much stuff and half of it sits unworn in the back of the wardrobe," Ms Wilby said."Before we buy anything else it's great to see what you've already got, and fall back in love with your things."Image caption Marcus and Goby modelled recycled clothes for a Mother of Pearl show at London Fashion Week Goby enjoyed the challenge."I was shocked by what you can do by reusing a garment and making it into something new which is actually really fashionable.I actually love it."And Ms Wilby said they did well."Considering Marcus had never set foot in a second-hand shop before - and thought they were smelly places with clothes you would never want to buy - by the end of the week he was finding pieces he really loved.That was a really great victory."These two shop a lot, and over the past month [since the challenge] he has only bought one item."Energy challenge The students took dramatic action to reduce their energy usage - and it worked.They used much less heating - switching it off at night; wearing jumpers, coats and blankets; and generally keeping the house a little bit cooler.It made a huge difference to their gas usage - cutting it by a whopping 48%.They also lowered their electricity usage by 15%.This added up to a 44% carbon saving - around a tonne of carbon in all."It was a massive effort - it was freezing in our house," said Marcus Golby.Image caption The students were able to drastically cut their home's energy bills "[Before] we weren't communicating when things were going on and going off, so you ended up with the heating on the majority of the time," explained Amy."This month we're having more of a balance of keeping warm and keeping the heating off when we're out."Dr Rosie Robison, an energy expert from Anglia Ruskin University, said it raised wider questions on whether the focus should be on individuals using less energy or the "wider responsibilities for landlords or homeowners, housebuilders and government for thinking about how our homes can require less fossil fuel in the first place".Food challenge A third of all food made for human consumption is wasted every year - costing the average UK family 700 each year, estimates suggest.The students were challenged to cut their food waste by 50% and move to the planetary health diet - a plant-based diet with small amounts of meat and fish.Image caption Helen and Will cooked vegetable bolognese for the house, as part of adopting the planetary health diet for a week Dr Elliot Woolley, a senior lecturer in sustainable manufacturing at Loughborough University, encouraged them to store their food more carefully to stop it becoming spoiled, plan their meals and prepare the right amount of food for the people eating.He said that they found the challenge hard, but had reduced their food waste from 8.1lb to 6.8lb, which he described as "a fairly small reduction".Image caption The contents of the students' food waste bin, before the challenge Dr Woolley added: "One of the things it shows is even when you're aware of the problem and you're trying to reduce waste, it's so ingrained into how we waste and use food that actually we continue with these large amounts."Housemate Will Smith said their waste totals were boosted by food bought before the challenge which had started to go off, but admitted: "I don't think we did too well."But he said it had changed his mindset and he would continue trying not to waste food in future.The Sustainable Students series was produced and directed by Owen Kean and Tom Yeates, with research by Curtis Gallant and Simon O'Leary.Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter - and see more of our stories here.
Disposable nappy recycling: How soiled nappies can be reused:::::Video A total of 187 billion nappies are thrown away each year, but unlike bottles, cans or cardboard, nappies are hard to recycle.But now engineers have devised ways of recovering the plastic and other materials inside them.A pilot plant has opened in Treviso, Italy, backed by the worlds largest maker of nappies Procter & Gamble.Eventually the plan is to offer parents across the city individual nappy bins which will then be picked up by trucks in separate waste collections.Science editor David Shukman reports.
Are plants a necessity or a luxury?:::::Video A new campaign says we should pay less tax on plants because they are good for the environment and mental health.It's being backed by the National Garden Scheme at a time when house plants are becoming increasingly popular - particularly among young people who can't afford gardens.In the UK, plants which don't produce food are subject to full VAT (Value Added Tax) at a rate of 20%.Whereas in other European countries, it can be at least half that.
Tulips from the air: Artist drawn to beauty of Norfolk flowers:::::Video Sunlight bouncing off vibrant colour from the UK's largest commercial outdoor tulip crop is difficult for artist Nigel Dickerson to resist.Each spring, for nearly a decade, Mr Dickerson has painted the tulip fields near King's Lynn - drawn to them by the "beauty of colour and the beauty of the space" they provide, he said.The flowers, from Belmont Nurseries, are grown as a bulb crop.This means they will never make it to a vase - they are beheaded to ensure the bulbs are strong enough to "force" flowers to grow under glass out of season to supply supermarkets.
Dame Emma Thompson: 'If I could fly cleanly, I would':::::Video Actress Dame Emma Thompson has been defending her decision to fly from the US to attend a climate change protest in central London.Speaking to reporters from the Extinction Rebellion campaign group's pink boat, she said did not fly as much as she used to - and planted a lot of trees.Ms Thompson also compared the protest to the campaign of disruption by the Suffragettes.
Norwich Cathedral peregrine falcons: A photographer's passion:::::Video The blur of a speeding peregrine falcon crossing the sky at up to 200mph is "extreme photography" and it creates a "buzz" for Norfolk wildlife snapper Chris Skipper.For nearly a decade the 41-year-old has followed the drama of urban peregrines nesting on the spire of Norwich Cathedral.New chicks, nest invasions, challenges to be the falcon's mate and untimely deaths - he has witnessed it all and shares his passion for the peregrines' adventures with thousands of people online.It is expected chicks from this year's clutch of four eggs, laid on the Hawk and Owl Trust's nesting platform at 75m (246ft) above ground, will hatch over the Easter weekend.
