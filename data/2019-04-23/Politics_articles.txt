Democratic presidential candidates divided over impeaching Trump:::::(Reuters) - A group of Democratic presidential candidates were divided on Monday over whether Republican President Donald Trump should be impeached, reflecting a broader split in the Democratic Party over how to react to Special Counsel Robert Muellers report into Russian election meddling.FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump attends the 2019 White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., April 22, 2019.REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Answering audience questions at a televised CNN event in the early voting state of New Hampshire, three Democratic 2020 candidates shied away from calling for Trumps impeachment.Another, California U.S.Senator Kamala Harris, said Congress should take the steps towards impeachment but believed such an effort would likely fail.Only one candidate at the event, Massachusetts U.S.Senator Elizabeth Warren, issued a full-throated call for Congress to try and remove Trump from office.If any other human being in this country had done whats documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail, Warren said.Julian Castro, the former mayor of San Antonio and another 2020 hopeful - who was not at the CNN event - has also called for Trumps impeachment.In the report released on Thursday, Mueller portrayed a president bent on stopping the probe into Russian meddling.But Mueller stopped short of concluding that a crime was committed, leaving it to Congress to make its own determination as to whether Trump obstructed justice.Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House, and some other Democratic Party leaders have been wary of impeaching Trump before the November 2020 presidential election.They believe there are not enough votes in the Republican-controlled Senate to remove Trump from office, and that such a move could play into his hands.They also remember Republican efforts to impeach former Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which backfired politically.But prominent liberals have demanded the start of proceedings to remove Trump from office since the release of a redacted version of Muellers report last week.In a letter to fellow Democratic lawmakers on Monday, Pelosi did not rule out impeaching Trump, but said it is important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings.She added that Trump engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior whether currently indictable or not.Reflecting the divide in the party over how to proceed over Muellers findings, the five 2020 candidates, who appeared at back-to-back events before an audience of young voters, were also split.Vermont U.S.Senator Bernie Sanders said: If for the next year and a half all the Congress is talking about is Trump, Trump, Trump, and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller and were not talking about the issues that concern ordinary Americans, I worry that works to Trumps advantage.Minnesota U.S.Senator Amy Klobuchar said she did not want to predispose things over the question of whether to impeach Trump and left that question up to the U.S. House of Representatives, where impeachment proceedings are initiated.South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg said Trump deserves to be impeached, but he would leave it to the House and Senate.He said politicians have to stop talking about Trump so much, and the best thing for Democrats would be to deliver an absolute thumping to Trump at the ballot box next November.
Mexico flags U.S. border delays as harmful to both countries:::::MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicos Foreign Ministry said on Monday that speeding up the flow of goods on the U.S. border is a matter of urgency and that slowdowns are detrimental to both economies, after bottlenecks have held up trade following a row over migration.Mexico's Foreign Affairs Minister Marcelo Ebrard makes declarations to the media after a meeting of European and Latin American leaders in Montevideo to discuss "good faith" plan for Venezuela, Uruguay February 7, 2019.REUTERS/Andres Stapff Delays along the U.S.-Mexico border began late last month after U.S. border agents were moved to handle an influx of migrants, slowing the flow of both goods and people.The staffing shortages came shortly after President Donald Trump threatened to close the border if Mexico did not halt a surge of people seeking asylum in the United States.Mexicos Foreign Ministry will present a report to the United States on Thursday detailing the economic costs of the delays, a spokesman said.Slowing the flow of goods and the transit of people is a detriment to our economies and for the regions competitiveness, the ministry said in a statement.There is urgent need to improve the transport of goods, as well as deepen mutual cooperation to ensure the efficiency and safety of our common border.The Ministry noted that Mexico overtook China to become the top U.S. trade partner in January and February, amid Trumps trade wars.Mexicos foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, spoke with northern border states on Monday in preparing to demonstrate to Washington the cost and uselessness of holding up border traffic, he said on Twitter.The collective losses for companies that rely on cross-border supply chains have reached into the millions.Nearly 30 companies in Ciudad Juarez, on the opposite side of the border from El Paso, Texas, reported losses of $15 million in a single week in early April.Ebrard previously said that U.S. officials pledged to help improve the flow of commercial traffic.
House panel chair subpoenas ex-White House counsel McGahn on Mueller inquiry:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler on Monday subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify before the panel in its investigation of possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.FILE PHOTO: White House Counsel Don McGahn listens during the confirmation hearing for U.S. Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 4, 2018.REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File Photo In a statement, Nadler, a Democrat, said the committee had asked for documents from McGahn by May 7 and for him to testify on May 21.An attorney for McGahn was not immediately available for comment.A report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller publicly released on Thursday by the Justice Department said Trump asked McGahn to fire Mueller as he was investigating suspected Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and possible coordination between Trump campaign members and Moscow officials.Mr. McGahn is a critical witness to many of the alleged instances of obstruction of justice and other misconduct described in the Mueller report, Nadler said.Muellers report said that the 22-month investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign conspired with Russians but Mueller did find multiple acts by the president that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations.The top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Representative Doug Collins, said it was premature to issue a subpoena.Instead of looking at material that Attorney General Barr has already made available, Democrats prefer to demand additional materials they know are subject to constitutional and common-law privileges and cannot be produced, Collins said in a statement.Nadler said Muellers report outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses.He said it now falls to Congress to determine for itself the full scope of the misconduct and to decide what steps to take in the exercise of our duties of oversight, legislation and constitutional accountability.According to the Mueller report, Trump directed McGahn in June 2017 to tell the Justice Departments No.2 official, Rod Rosenstein, that Mueller had conflicts of interest and must be removed.McGahn did not carry out the order.
On staff following orders, Trump says: 'Nobody disobeys me':::::By David Alexander and Alexandra Alper WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump dismissed questions from reporters on Monday about his staffs reluctance to carry out his orders and the chances of impeachment proceedings in the U.S. Congress, days after the Mueller report highlighted both issues.The 448-page report from U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election revealed staff and associates sometimes ignored requests from Trump to deliver messages, including one to fire Mueller.Nobody disobeys me, Republican Trump said when asked if he was worried about his orders not being followed.He made the remark at the White House during an annual Easter celebration.Muellers report said that the 22-month investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russians during the 2016 election campaign, but Mueller did find multiple acts by the president that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations.According to the report, White House Counsel Don McGahn had been on the brink of resigning when Trump told him to ask Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to fire Mueller.Trump then denied using the word fire, according to McGahns retelling to Mueller.Trump lashed out at the report on Twitter later on Monday.Isnt it amazing that the people who were closest to me, by far, and knew the Campaign better than anyone, were never even called to testify before Mueller, Trump wrote.Muellers report drew upon interviews, notes and communications with Trump advisers.Trumps personal lawyer during the campaign, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to crimes as did campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trumps first national security adviser Michael Flynn.Muellers report drew upon dozens of interviews, notes and communications with White House advisers.Asked on Monday whether he was concerned about the threat of impeachment on allegations of obstruction of justice as some Democrats have called for, Trump said, Not even a little bit.U.S.Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, on Friday said Congress should begin the process of removing Trump from office.Other Democratic leaders have played down talk of impeachment, just 18 months before the 2020 election.A person in an Easter Bunny costume looks on as U.S. President Donald Trump attends the 2019 White House Easter Egg Roll in Washington, U.S., April 22, 2019.REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Republicans have stood by Trump and while an impeachment effort might succeed in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, it was unlikely to do so in the Republican-led Senate.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday House Democrats views vary on how to proceed.Trump, speaking from the White House balcony on Monday, returned to favorite topics of his by touting the strong United States economy and saying his administration was rebuilding the military to a level never seen before.Our country is doing fantastically well, probably the best it has ever done economically, he said.
Trump sues to block Congress subpoena for his financial records:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday filed suit to keep U.S. lawmakers from obtaining his financial records, the first salvo in what promises to be an escalating legal battle with Democrats in Congress.The suit seeks to block a subpoena issued by the Democratic chairman of the U.S. House Oversight Committee for information about Trumps personal and business finances, alleging Democrats have launched all-out political war on Trump with subpoenas as their weapon of choice.The committees subpoena sought eight years of documents from Mazars USA, an accounting firm long used by Trump to prepare financial statements, related to its investigation of allegations Trump inflated or deflated financial statements for potentially improper purposes.Elijah Cummings, the House Oversight Committee chairman, issued the subpoena to the presidents accountant after Trumps former lawyer, Michael Cohen, testified to Congress in February that Trump had misrepresented his net worth.Chairman Cummings subpoena is invalid and unenforceable because it has no legitimate legislative purpose, Trumps lawyers said in a filing, arguing it exceeded constitutional limits on the power of Congress to investigate.Its goal is to expose Plaintiffs private financial information for the sake of exposure, with the hope that it will turn up something that Democrats can use as a political tool against the President now and in the 2020 election, they said.In a statement on Monday, Cummings said there was no valid legal basis to try to block the subpoena and accused the White House of unprecedented stonewalling in refusing to produce a single document or witness to the committee.This complaint reads more like political talking points than a reasoned legal brief, and it contains a litany of inaccurate information, Cummings said.Related Coverage Top Democrat on U.S. House Oversight Committee says Trump lawsuit has no legal basis The filing was the first effort by Trumps legal team to quash multiple investigations of Trump and his finances by Democratic-led committees in Congress.His lawyers made it clear they would resist those efforts.Democrats are using their new control of congressional committees to investigate every aspect of President Trumps personal finances, businesses, and even his family, Trumps lawyers said.Instead of working with the President to pass bipartisan legislation that would actually benefit Americans, Democrats are singularly obsessed with finding something they can use to damage the President politically, they said.The Trump Organization, the presidents privately owned real estate company, is also a plaintiff in the lawsuit.Trump is suing in his individual capacity, and is represented by a private law firm rather than government lawyers from the U.S. Department of Justice.Republicans on the Oversight Committee also had objected to the subpoena from Cummings, arguing it was an abuse of congressional authority to target the private financial information of Trump.As a firm we will respect this process and will comply with all legal obligations, Mazars said in a statement.As with all clients, we are precluded by our professional code of conduct and corporate policy from commenting further on inquiries of this nature.Ross Garber, a Washington lawyer who focuses on political investigations, said the lawsuit might be dismissed because of the Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which offers broad legal protection to members of Congress for actions they undertake as legislators.But Garber also said there was some merit to Trumps argument that the subpoena was brought for the improper purpose of unearthing politically damaging information about him, rather than for a legitimate legislative purpose.U.S. President Donald Trump boards Air Force One as they travel to Florida for Easter weekend, at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, U.S., April 18, 2019.REUTERS/Al Drago Congressional authority is vast but it is not unlimited, and the complaint raises potentially legitimate questions, Garber said, adding that Congress would have a stronger basis for the request if it had initiated impeachment hearings, when courts have said its investigative powers are heightened.Garber said disputes between the White House and Congress over documents are often resolved through negotiation, rather than lawsuits, and that a compromise was still possible.The filing said Democrats have issued more than 100 subpoenas and requests to anyone with even the most tangential connection to the President.
Democrats to continue probes of Trump amid no consensus on impeachment:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democrats are divided over whether to proceed directly to impeach President Donald Trump after Special Counsel Robert Muellers Russia probe, but they can still hold Trump accountable without impeachment, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday.FILE PHOTO: Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) stands during a meeting with European Parliament President Antonio Tajani on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., February 27, 2019.REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo In a letter to fellow Democratic lawmakers, Pelosi said it is important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings.She added that Trump engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior whether currently indictable or not.Pelosi and some other Democratic Party leaders have been wary of impeaching Republican Trump just 18 months before the November 2020 presidential election, although prominent liberals have demanded the start of proceedings to remove Trump from office since the release of a redacted version of Muellers report on Thursday.Senior congressional Democrats have left the door open to pursuing impeachment but have also said they would first need to complete their own probe into whether Trump obstructed justice in Muellers investigation.While our views range from proceeding to investigate the findings of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth, Pelosi said in her letter.During a conference call of House Democrats on Monday, House committee chairmen discussed moving ahead with various investigations of Trump to see where the facts lead, lawmakers said afterwards.Not fact-finding as a means of punting ... but as a means of determining how best to fulfill our responsibilities, Representative Tom Malinowski said.Theres no question that Mueller referred this to the Congress, and none of us want to drop the ball.Muellers report concluded that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election in sweeping and systematic fashion, but that there was not enough evidence to establish that Trumps campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy with Moscow.However, the report outlined multiple instances where Trump tried to thwart Muellers probe.While it stopped short of concluding Trump had committed a crime, it did not exonerate him.Mueller also noted that Congress has the power to address whether Trump violated the law.Impeachment advocates also spoke up during the Democrats conference call, but I would say that was a minority point of view, said Representative Gerry Connolly.He said Democrats would continue various investigations of Trump, including of his tax returns and financial dealings, but any quick move to impeachment could truncate those probes.

presidential nomination - and it is expected to keep growing.Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is mulling a 2020 presidential candidacy, speaks at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) construction and maintenance conference in Washington, U.S., April 5, 2019.REUTERS/Joshua Roberts The diverse group vying to challenge President Donald Trump, the likely Republican nominee, includes six U.S. senators.A record six women are running, as well as black, Hispanic and openly gay candidates who would make history if one of them becomes the partys nominee.Here are the Democrats who have launched campaigns or are expected to pursue a presidential bid, listed in order of their RealClearPolitics national polling average for those who register in opinion surveys.JOE BIDEN The leader in polls of Democratic presidential contenders is not even a candidate yet.But Biden, who served eight years as vice president under President Barack Obama and 36 years in the U.S. Senate, looks poised to join the 2020 race.At 76, he would be the second oldest candidate in the Democratic nominating contests, after Senator Bernie Sanders.Biden would be a key figure in the Democratic debate over whether a liberal political newcomer or a centrist veteran is needed to win back the White House.Liberal activists criticise his Senate record, including his authorship of the 1994 crime act that led to increased incarceration rates, and his ties to the financial industry, which is prominent in his home state of Delaware.Biden, who relishes his Middle-Class Joe nickname and touts his working-class roots, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008.Biden, recently the subject of allegations of unwanted physical contact with women, in a video pledged to be more mindful of respecting personal space, an attempt to tamp down the controversy.BERNIE SANDERS The senator from Vermont lost the Democratic nomination in 2016 to Hillary Clinton but has jumped in for a second try.In the 2020 race, Sanders, 77, will have to fight to stand out in a packed field of progressives touting issues he brought into the Democratic Party mainstream four years ago.His proposals include free tuition at public colleges, a $15 minimum wage and universal healthcare.He benefits from strong name recognition and a robust network of small-dollar donors, helping him to raise $5.9 million during his first day in the contest.Sanders, whose father was a Jewish immigrant from Poland, has shown a more personal side in this campaign, highlighting his struggles while growing up in a working-class family.He also has tried to reach out to black and Hispanic leaders after having trouble winning over minority voters in 2016.BETO OROURKE The former three-term Texas congressman jumped into the race on March 14 - and has been jumping on to store countertops ever since to deliver his optimistic message to voters in early primary states.ORourke, 46, gained fame last year for his record fundraising and ability to draw crowds ahead of his unexpectedly narrow loss in the U.S. Senate race against Republican incumbent Ted Cruz.ORourke announced a $6.1 million fundraising haul for the first 24 hours of his campaign, besting his Democratic opponents.But with progressive policies and diversity at the forefront of the partys nominating battle, ORourke will face a challenge as a wealthy white man who is more moderate on several key issues than many of his competitors.KAMALA HARRIS The first-term senator from California would make history as the first black woman to gain the nomination.Harris, 54, the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India, announced her candidacy on the holiday honoring slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. She has made a quick impact in a Democratic race that will be heavily influenced by women and minority voters.She raised $1.5 million in the first 24 hours of her campaign and drew record ratings on a CNN televised town hall.She supports a middle-class tax credit, Medicare for All healthcare funding reform, the Green New Deal and the legalization of marijuana.Her track record as San Franciscos district attorney and Californias attorney general has drawn scrutiny in a Democratic Party that has shifted in recent years on criminal justice issues.PETE BUTTIGIEG The 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is emerging from underdog status as he begins to build momentum with young voters.A Harvard University graduate and Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford, he speaks seven languages and served in Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserve.He touts himself as representing a new generation of leadership needed to combat Trump.Buttigieg would be the first openly gay presidential nominee of a major American political party.ELIZABETH WARREN The 69-year-old senator from Massachusetts is a leader of the partys liberals and a fierce Wall Street critic who was instrumental in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.She has focused her presidential campaign on her populist economic message, promising to fight what she calls a rigged economic system that favors the wealthy.She also has proposed eliminating the Electoral College, vowed to break up Amazon, Google and Facebook if elected, and sworn off political fundraising events to collect cash for her bid.Warren apologized earlier this year to the Cherokee Nation for taking a DNA test to prove her claims to Native American ancestry, an assertion that has prompted Trump to mockingly refer to her as Pocahontas.CORY BOOKER Booker, 49, a senator from New Jersey and former mayor of Newark, gained national prominence in the fight over Brett Kavanaughs Supreme Court nomination.Booker, who is black, has made U.S. race relations and racial disparities a focus of his campaign, noting the impact of discrimination on his family.He embraces progressive positions on Medicare coverage for every American, the Green New Deal and other key issues, and touts his style of positivity over attacks.Booker eats a vegan diet and recently confirmed rumors he is dating actress Rosario Dawson.AMY KLOBUCHAR The third-term senator from Minnesota was the first moderate in the Democratic field vying to challenge Trump.Klobuchar, 58, gained national attention in 2018 when she sparred with Brett Kavanaugh during Senate hearings for his Supreme Court nomination.On the campaign trail, the former prosecutor and corporate attorney supports an alternative to traditional Medicare healthcare funding and is taking a hard stance against rising prescription drug prices.Klobuchars campaign reported raising more than $1 million in its first 48 hours.Her campaign announcement came amid news reports that staff in her Senate office were asked to do menial tasks, making it difficult to hire high-level campaign strategists.JULIAN CASTRO The secretary of housing and urban development under President Barack Obama would be the first Hispanic to win a major U.S. partys presidential nomination.Castro, 44, whose grandmother was immigrated to Texas from Mexico, has used his familys personal story to criticize Trumps border

Democratic presidential candidate so far to oppose the Green New Deal plan to tackle climate change, saying it would give the government too much power in investment decisions.During his two terms in office, Colorados economy soared and the Western state expanded healthcare, passed a gun control law and legalized marijuana.The former geologist and brew pub owner is among the many candidates who have refused to take corporate money.He previously served as mayor of Denver.JAY INSLEE The Washington state governor has made fighting climate change the central issue of his campaign.As governor,

Elizabeth Warren proposes canceling billions in student loan debt:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election, wants to cancel billions of dollars in student loan debt and make college cheaper for students going forward.Warren, in a post on the website Medium, proposed canceling $50,000 in student loan debt for anyone with annual household income under $100,000, which her campaign said would amount to 42 million Americans.It would also cancel some debt for those with household incomes between $100,000 and $250,000.Warren, who has long advocated in Congress for providing debt relief to students, called student loan debt a crisis.She said canceling debt for millions of people would help close the nations racial and wealth gap, and also proposed making all two-year and four-year public colleges free.The first step in addressing this crisis is to deal head-on with the outstanding debt that is weighing down millions of families and should never have been required in the first place, Warren wrote.Warren is competing in a crowded field of more than 20 Democrats vying for their partys 2020 nomination and has sought to distinguish herself by offering numerous, expansive policy proposals.Anticipating Republican criticism that her proposal would be too expensive, Warren said her debt cancellation plan and universal free college could be paid for through an Ultra-Millionaire Tax, which would impose a 2 percent annual tax on families with $50 million or more in wealth.Education has been a topic on the campaign trail for some of Warrens rivals as well.U.S.Senator Kamala Harris, another contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, released a plan last month that would use $315 billion in federal money over 10 years to give the average teacher a $13,500 raise, or about a 23 percent salary increase.
Congressman Moulton enters Democratic 2020 presidential race:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Seth Moulton entered the 2020 Democratic presidential race on Monday as a long-shot contender in a contest that now includes almost 20 candidates.A 40-year-old Iraq War veteran who represents a district in Massachusetts, Moulton enters the race as an underdog, with little national name recognition and a shorter track record than some rivals who have spent years in the U.S. Senate or as state governors.Moulton has built a political career by challenging the partys establishment.He entered Congress in 2015 after winning a Democratic primary challenge against John Tierney, who had held the seat for 18 years.After Democrats took control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018, Moulton helped organize opposition to Representative Nancy Pelosis bid to again become Speaker of the House.He ended his opposition to Pelosi with a statement saying: Tough conversations make us stronger, not weaker, and we need to keep having them if were going to deliver on the change that weve promised the American people.In a YouTube video announcing his presidential candidacy, he said: Decades of division and corruption have broken our democracy and robbed Americans of their voice.While our country marches forward, Washington is anchored in the past, he said.In the video, Moulton said he wants to tackle climate change and grow the U.S. economy by promoting green jobs as well as high tech and advanced manufacturing.Moulton served in the Marines from 2001 to 2008.During his 2014 congressional bid, he became a vocal critic of the Iraq War in which he served, saying no more troops should be deployed to the country.He has advocated stricter gun laws, saying military-style weapons should not be owned by civilians.Slideshow (2 Images) Moulton supports the legalization of marijuana and told Boston public radio station WGBH in 2016 that he had smoked pot while in college.He graduated from Harvard University with an undergraduate degree in physics in 2001 and returned to receive a masters degree in business and public policy in 2011.For a graphic of the 2020 presidential candidates, see: tmsnrt.rs/2Ff62ZC
Top Democrat on U.S. House Oversight Committee says Trump lawsuit has no legal basis:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Elijah Cummings, chairman of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, criticized as baseless a lawsuit filed on Monday by President Donald Trump to try to block subpoenas from the committee seeking years worth of financial documents from the president.There is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress, Cummings, a Democrat, said in a statement.This complaint reads more like political talking points than a reasoned legal brief, and it contains a litany of inaccurate information.He added: The White House is engaged in unprecedented stonewalling on all fronts, and they have refused to produce a single document or witness to the Oversight Committee during this entire year.
Companies warn Trump: Census citizenship question could be costly:::::(This April 17 story corrects the tenth paragraph to show DeVere Kutscher is no longer executive director of the Census Business Coalition.)FILE PHOTO: An informational pamphlet is displayed at an event for community activists and local government leaders to mark the one-year-out launch of the 2020 Census efforts in Boston, Massachusetts, U.S., April 1, 2019.REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo By Lauren Tara LaCapra NEW YORK (Reuters) - An array of U.S. companies have told the Trump administration that a citizenship question on the 2020 Census would harm business if it leads to an undercount of immigrants, undermining the data they use to place stores, plan inventory and plot ad campaigns.Corporate executives, lobbyists and representatives from major industry groups like the Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the International Council of Shopping Centers have raised the issue in meetings with government officials, according to more than a dozen sources familiar with the matter.Some meetings date back to 2017, when the administration was first mulling adding the question.Industry officials continue to seek assurances from the Census Bureau and the Commerce Department that the questions impact on the quality of Census data will be minimized, according to the sources, who described the meetings on condition of anonymity.The pressure reflects the economic importance of the decennial count of Americas inhabitants.The Census is used to draw voting districts and divide some $800 billion in federal programs.For companies, it provides the most detailed picture available of consumer and labor markets.Under the administrations proposal, the Census would ask whether respondents are citizens of the United States for the first time in 70 years.Corporate America finds itself in an unlikely alliance with immigrant advocacy groups that have sued to block the question on the basis it could scare immigrants out of participating, and therefore cost their communities funds and political representation.The Supreme Court plans to hear arguments on the case next week.Clothes-maker Levi Strauss & Co, transport companies Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc and media group Univision Communications Inc are among a handful of companies supporting that lawsuit.In court documents, they said the citizenship question threatens to undermine (the) reliability of Census data and therefore substantially reduce its value to businesses.Few other companies or trade groups, however, have been willing to discuss their opposition to the citizenship question publicly.In interviews, sources said they are only voicing opinions in private meetings, out of concern about a White House backlash.Spokespeople for several major trade groups along with big name companies like Walmart Inc, Alphabet Incs Google, Amazon.com Inc and many others either declined to offer a statement for this story or did not respond to requests for comment.While corporations and business groups are reluctant to enter the political turmoil surrounding the citizenship question on the 2020 Census, they nonetheless depend heavily on accurate Census data for their operations, said DeVere Kutscher, who was until recently executive director of the Census Business Coalition, one of the main groups advocating on behalf of industry.As a result, they are focusing their efforts on what they can do to support a complete, secure, and accurate count, and are understandably concerned about the impact of any factor which could jeopardize that, he added.Underscoring the political stakes, earlier this month President Donald Trump ripped radical Democrats opposed to the citizenship question on Twitter, saying a Census without such a question would be meaningless.The Census Bureau has taken pains to ensure everyone is counted, Burton Reist, a longtime Census official who oversees decennial communications and stakeholder relations, said in an interview.In response to questions about the business communitys view on the citizenship question, a spokesman pointed Reuters to the Census Bureaus official responses to stakeholders.The Commerce Department, which houses the Census Bureau, provided a statement detailing the planned communications and outreach spending that will encourage people to respond.The budget is $500 million, up from the $376 million spent in 2010.The Census Bureau has long been planning the most robust marketing and outreach effort in Census history for the 2020 Census, a spokesman said in a statement.Documents released through litigation confirm that Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with dozens of interested parties, including business groups, to get their views before announcing his decision to add the citizenship question last year.While many expressed concerns that the question would hurt response rates, Ross was not convinced, according to a March 2018 memo he wrote explaining his decision.He said data from the question would help the Department of Justice enforce provisions of the Voting Rights Act.AN MRI FOR BUSINESS The stakes are high in getting an accurate count.Retailers like Walmart and Target Corp use Census data to decide where to open stores or distribution hubs, and what to stock on shelves.Big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co use the information similarly for branch strategy, and real-estate firms scrutinize the statistics to determine where to build homes and shopping centers.TV networks like Univision, meanwhile, rely on the numbers to plan programming in local markets.And the Census is an important input for tech giants like Google when they create myriad data-based products, such as maps.You get households, number of people, number of bedrooms, income, gender, age, race, marital status its almost like an MRI, said Jack Kleinhenz, chief economist for the National Retail Federation.And it all goes into assessing where and how to provide goods and services.Underscoring how the survey can drive major business decisions, Amazons 20-city search for a new headquarters location also had Census data at its core.Having failed to convince the administration to drop the question, companies are now focused on programs to encourage people to participate in the Census to bolster data quality, sources said.Efforts could include company-wide email messages to employees, prominently displaying a link to the Census on corporate web sites or setting up physical stations where customers can fill out the survey inside of stores or malls, the sources said.Slideshow (3 Images) Ahead of the 2010 Census, McDonalds Corp featured information on restaurant placemats, Walmart greeters handed out flyers, big retailers featured reminders on receipts and utility companies stuck inserts into electric, gas and water bills.Such programs have been helpful in the past, said John Thompson, who spent nearly 30 years at the Census Bureau before leaving as director in 2017.But whether they can overcome the negative impact of the citizenship question is an open question.Theyve got a tougher row to hoe, he said.
Top Democrats leave open option of Trump impeachment after Mueller report:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top congressional Democrats left the door open on Sunday to the impeachment of U.S. President Donald Trump, but said they would first need to complete their own investigations into whether he obstructed justice in Special Counsel Robert Muellers Russia probe.Party leaders have cautioned against impeachment just 18 months before the November 2020 presidential election, although prominent liberals have demanded the start of proceedings to remove Trump from office since the release of a redacted version of Muellers report on Thursday.U.S. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, whose panel would spearhead any impeachment proceedings, said Democrats would press ahead with investigations of Trump in Congress and see where the facts lead us.Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable, Nadler said on NBCs Meet the Press.The redacted version of Muellers long-awaited report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, the product of a 22-month investigation, outlined multiple instances where Trump tried to thwart the probe.While it stopped short of concluding Trump had committed a crime, it did not exonerate him.Mueller also noted that Congress has the power to address whether Trump violated the law, and Democrats said it would be a matter of discussion in the coming weeks.Thats going to be a very consequential decision and one Im going to reserve judgment on until we have a chance to fully deliberate on it, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said on Fox News Sunday.Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, planned a conference call for Monday afternoon to discuss their next steps in response to the Mueller report.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote lawmakers last week to notify them of the call to discuss this grave matter.Nadler on Friday issued a subpoena to the Justice Department to hand over the full, unredacted Mueller report and underlying evidence by May 1.The Justice Department called the request premature and unnecessary.Before drawing any conclusions, Nadler said Democrats want to hear from Mueller and Attorney General William Barr, who is scheduled to testify in early May.Nadler also said he would call former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify.Republicans have stood by Trump and an impeachment effort was unlikely to succeed in the Republican-led Senate.Trump, who denounces the investigation as a witch hunt, claimed vindication from Muellers report.He has called for an investigation of how the FBI began the probe, and has tried to blame Democrats.How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats?he wrote on Twitter.U.S.Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first major contender for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination to call for the start of impeachment proceedings, saying on Friday that the severity of this misconduct demanded it.Julian Castro, former housing secretary under President Barack Obama and another 2020 contender, joined Warren.Democratic House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, however, said, Im not there yet.He told CBS Face the Nation that Congress needed to look at Trumps finances and gauge Muellers intentions with his report.Even if Senate Republicans blocked any eventual Democratic impeachment effort, Cummings said, I think history would smile upon us for standing up for the Constitution.Representative Tim Ryan, another Democratic presidential contender, said the party should wait until multiple ongoing investigations of Trump in Congress have had a chance to uncover more evidence.U.S. President Donald Trump walks to board Air Force One as they travel to Florida for Easter weekend, at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, U.S., April 18, 2019.REUTERS/Al Drago Let the process play itself out, he said on CNNs State of the Union.While Trumps team had indicated it would release a rebuttal to Muellers report, Rudy Giuliani, said that was not imminent.We planned to do it if we needed to.So far, we dont think we need to, he said on Fox News Sunday.
Vulnerable House Democrats tread carefully in wake of Mueller report:::::(Reuters) - Vulnerable House Democrats, mindful of President Donald Trumps continued strength among Republican voters, are using caution in how they respond to the special counsels report, which detailed Trumps efforts to thwart the investigation into Russian efforts to help him win the White House.FILE PHOTO - U.S. Representative Haley Stevens speaks with constituents at a town hall meeting in Livonia, Michigan, U.S. April 18, 2019.. REUTERS/Steve Friess More than 30 Democratic representatives, many of whom are in their first term, represent districts that supported Trump in 2016.The partys chances of keeping control of the U.S. House of Representatives likely hinge its ability to defend those seats.In the report released on Thursday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Trump may have obstructed justice and portrayed a president bent on stopping the probe into Russian meddling.But Mueller stopped short of concluding that a crime was committed, leaving it to Congress to make its own determination.That is putting pressure on congressional Democrats to decide whether to pursue impeachment charges against Trump, whose continued popularity with his Republican base could weigh heavily on Democratic lawmakers in swing districts.Those incumbent Democrats may have to strike a delicate balance on the campaign trail next year.Too much bashing of the president could turn off voters more interested in kitchen-table issues and motivate Trump sympathizers to rally around him.Hours after Muellers findings were released, Abby Spanberger, a Democratic congresswoman from Virginia, held a town hall that saw virtually no discussion of the report.She knocked off a Republican incumbent last year in a district that favored Trump by more than 6 percentage points in 2016.The 39-year-old representative told reporters before the event that she was more interested in preventing Russia from attacking the electoral process than in re-litigating the 2016 presidential contest.Regardless of what actions the president did or didnt take ... understanding in far greater detail the aggression of a foreign adversary nation against our elections infrastructure should ideally help us avoid such circumstances in the future, she said.Other Democrats facing reelection in swing districts also reacted cautiously, saying they would reserve judgment until after reading the voluminous report, or emphasizing the threat of Russian interference rather than Trumps behavior.If the conclusion remains that there is no further criminal wrongdoing, I think we should, as a country, move on and ensure that Russia cannot interfere again, said Ben McAdams, a freshman Utah Democrat in a Republican-leaning district.INTERNAL DEBATE The 448-page reports release has sparked an internal debate within the Democratic Party on how to move forward.Party leaders played down talk of impeachment, even as they said they would pursue a full, unredacted copy of the report and bring Mueller himself to Capitol Hill to testify under oath.At the same time, some liberal members of the caucus, including Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez of New York, expressed support for starting an impeachment inquiry.U.S. Representative Cheri Bustos, the Illinois Democrat who chairs the partys House campaign arm, set the tone for her most endangered colleagues on Thursday.In a statement, she said she would read the report carefully, then pivoted to other issues.As we review this report, I also remain committed to continuing my efforts to bring down the cost of health care, invest in our infrastructure and clean up the mess in Washington, Bustos said.Haley Stevens, a Michigan Democrat who won her first term last fall in a district that voted for Trump in 2016, told Reuters many Democrats were elected because voters want checks and balances and a return to good government and government we can trust.Still, speaking after a town hall on Thursday evening, the 35-year-old emphasized that most voters going into 2020 are more concerned about issues such as health care, education and infrastructure.One of her constituents, Joy Marie Zug, said she voted for Trump in 2016 after having supported Democratic President Barack Obama.Zug says she has since soured on Trump due to his lies.The 46-year-old adult education administrator said Democrats should consider impeachment, based on the mountain of evidence in the Mueller report.But in a reflection of the difficulty of the strategic choice facing Democrats, she also said they should avoid making it a top campaign issue.I dont think this is something they need to run on, she said.I just wish this wasnt the end.WEIGHING PRIORITIES Democrats looking to 2020 must also weigh whether voters views on the Russia probe are even susceptible to persuasion, given the countrys deep partisan divides.A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted on Thursday and Friday after the report came out found 50 percent of Americans agreed that Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia during the campaign, and 58 percent of respondents said they believed Trump tried to stop investigations into the campaigns conduct.Those figures, which split heavily along party lines, were fairly similar to previous polls.One senior Democratic strategist involved in shaping the campaign message for 2020 House candidates, who asked for anonymity when discussing the partys internal thinking, said the partys own research showed the Russia probe was not particularly resonant for voters.Still, he said Muellers findings would create the background mood music when Democrats talk in broad terms about corruption and government accountability.
Republican Romney says he is 'sickened' by Trump's behavior during Russia probe:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said on Friday he was sickened by the dishonesty of U.S. President Donald Trump and people around him as portrayed in a report on Russias attempts to influence the 2016 election.FILE PHOTO: Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) walks to his office on the opening day of the 116th Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S. January 3, 2019.REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein Romney, now a U.S. senator from Utah and an off-and-on Trump critic, was responding to the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who described how Trump sought to disrupt the probe into ties between his presidential campaign and Russia.Mueller did not establish that Trumps campaign team colluded with Moscow and he did not charge the president with obstructing justice, but the report provided extensive details of Trumps efforts to thwart the probe.Romney said it was good news that there had been insufficient evidence to charge Trump with conspiring with a foreign adversary or obstructing justice, which he said could have triggered a constitutional crisis.Even so, I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President, Romney said in a statement posted on Twitter.I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia - including information that had been illegally obtained; that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement; and that the campaign chairman was actively promoting Russian interests in Ukraine, he added.Romney was sharply critical of Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign before being considered briefly as a candidate for secretary of state in Trumps administration.His sharp statement on Friday breaks with the position of other Republicans and the White House, which has declared the report a victory for the president.Trump has repeatedly dubbed the investigation a witch hunt and insisted he did not engage in collusion or obstruction.Trump remains popular with most Republicans but a potential challenge from someone such as Romney in the Republican primary process next year could complicate Trumps bid to win a second term in 2020.Romney lost the 2012 presidential election to Democratic candidate Barack Obama.Congressional Democrats on Friday took legal action to get hold of all of Muellers evidence from his inquiry.
Trump approval drops 3 points to 2019 low after release of Mueller report: Reuters/Ipsos poll:::::NEW YORK (Reuters) - The number of Americans who approve of President Donald Trump dropped by 3 percentage points to the lowest level of the year following the release of a special counsel report detailing Russian interference in the last U.S. presidential election, according to an exclusive Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll.The poll, conducted Thursday afternoon to Friday morning, is the first national survey to measure the response from the American public after the U.S. Justice Department released Special Counsel Robert Muellers 448-page report that recounted numerous occasions in which Trump may have interfered with the investigation.According to the poll, 37 percent of adults in the United States approved of Trumps performance in office, down from 40 percent in a similar poll conducted on April 15 and matching the lowest level of the year.That is also down from 43 percent in a poll conducted shortly after U.S. Attorney General William Barr circulated a summary of the report in March.In his report, Mueller said his investigation did not establish that the Trump campaign had coordinated with Russians.However, investigators did find multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations.While Mueller ultimately decided not to charge Trump with a crime, he also said that the investigation did not exonerate the president, either.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States.It gathered responses from 1,005 adults, including 924 who were familiar with the Mueller report.It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.To see the entire Reuters/Ipsos poll, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2DjEq3R SHARP SPLIT The poll found that 50 percent of Americans agreed that Trump or someone from his campaign worked with Russia to influence the 2016 election, and 58 percent agreed that the president tried to stop investigations into Russian influence on his administration.Forty percent said they thought Trump should be impeached, while 42 percent said he should not.The poll responses were sharply split along party lines, with Democrats much more critical of Trump than his fellow Republicans.The Mueller investigation had previously charged 34 other people and three Russian entities, netting convictions or guilty pleas from several Trump associates including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and longtime personal attorney Michael Cohen.So far, the report does not appear to have convinced many to change their opinions about the presidents conduct during a bitter presidential campaign, whether his inner circle improperly engaged with Russian agents, or if he tried to interfere with federal investigators afterward.U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to board Marine One en route to his Mar-a-Lago estate in West Palm Beach, Florida following the release of the Mueller report at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 18, 2019.REUTERS/Carlos Barria Among those respondents who said they were familiar with the Mueller report, 70 percent said the report had not changed their view of Trump or Russias involvement in the U.S. presidential race.Only 15 percent said they had learned something that changed their view of Trump or the Russia investigation, and a majority of those respondents said they were now more likely to believe that Trump or someone close to him broke the law.(For a 'Link to Mueller report' click here) (For a graphic on 'A closer look at Mueller report redactions' click tmsnrt.rs/2VSx7HZ)
Mueller report strengthens resolves on both sides of political spectrum:::::CLEARWATER, Florida/LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - After months as volunteer activists demanding that U.S. President Donald Trump be impeached, Eileen and Michael OBrien sat on their couch on Thursday, cracked open a laptop and began to read the 448-page special counsel report that liberals have dreamed would make impeachment a reality.Eileen OBrien, 65, and Michael OBrien, 62, read the redacted report by U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, at their home in Clearwater, Florida, U.S., April 18, 2019.REUTERS/Letitia Stein Hmm, seems like theres a lot of gray area here, said Eileen OBrien, 65, of Clearwater, Florida, reading aloud a line about the findings falling short of a criminal case.Legally wrong and morally wrong are two different things.The release of the long-anticipated report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on his inquiry into Russias role in the 2016 election landed in a stridently divided America: one side convinced Trump acted improperly, the other adamant that the investigation was a politically driven farce.Mueller built an extensive case that Trump committed obstruction of justice but stopped short of concluding he had committed a crime, though he did not exonerate the president.For those like the OBriens who have been pining for impeachment, the report renewed resolve to oust the president.For those who want to see the president reelected, there was a sense of vindication.The White House is going to put out their own version of things, which is basically fish wrapper, said Michael OBrien, formerly a service technician who now works on houses.His wife, who a day earlier delivered a can of impeaches peaches to a lawmaker, looked up with a quizzical expression.Its worthless, he explained.You can use it to wrap fish.ONE BATTLE IN A WAR Lee Mueller and his wife, Michele Mueller, no relation to Robert Mueller, also paused their Thursday to read through the special counsels report.They printed out the table of contents for both volumes along with the executive summaries.I view the Mueller report as being one battle in a war against the United States of Americas founding principles and against Donald Trump, Michele Mueller, 61, said in a suburb of Las Vegas.After Attorney General William Barr released his four-page summary of the Mueller report late last month, Americans were dug in on their views.So far, the full report does not appear to have convinced many to change their opinions about the presidents conduct.A Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll conducted Thursday afternoon to Friday morning found among those respondents of who said they were familiar with the Mueller report, 70 percent said the report had not changed their view of Trump or Russias involvement in the U.S. presidential race.Only 15 percent said they had learned something that changed their view of Trump or the Russia investigation, and a majority of those respondents said they were now more likely to believe that Trump or someone close to him broke the law.Trumps approval ratings, however, dipped 3 percentage points after the release of the report, the poll found.Ahead of Thursdays release of the Mueller report, Trump ramped up his insistence that he was the victim, not the perpetrator, of crimes.James Stratton, 65, of Clearwater, Florida, caught snippets of the news about the report from conservative commentators Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.He looked up Barrs news conference, held Thursday morning before the report was released online, on YouTube.Nobody on our side is going to change, the Republican president of the local Tampa Bay Trump Club said in a phone interview, adding that liberals will grow tired of hearing predictions about Trumps downfall that never materialize.We stay focused on the issues.How do we stop socialism?How do we protect our borders?IT WILL ONLY AFFIRM For the most invested, though, Muellers report offered hope for further investigation, but by Democrats in Congress this time.Tom Steyer, a billionaire activist who has spent millions of his own dollars directing pressure at Congress to impeach Trump, said while he thinks the contents of the report implicate the president, he acknowledges the findings alone are unlikely to convince Americans to change their minds.I think the only way to get voters to notice is to directly publicize, televised hearings, Steyer said.Were all for public hearings so the American people can see and can react themselves.In Florida, Margo Hammond, 69, who considers herself an independent voter, gleaned highlights by toggling through the coverage of MSNBC, CNN and Fox News.She was unimpressed with Barr.Its kind of an insult to the American people that we cant decide for ourselves, she said while in an art class.She planned to read as much as she could of the report.Slideshow (3 Images) I think it will only affirm what I originally thought, she said.Then she repeated something she had heard earlier from a news commentator: There was a whole lot of cheating going on.(For a 'Link to Mueller report'

Top Democrats in Congress reject Barr's proposal to limit Mueller report access:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Top Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate on Friday rejected Attorney General William Barrs proposal to allow them access to a less-redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Muellers Russia investigation report.In an April 19 letter to the attorney general, six Democratic lawmakers led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer instead reiterated their demand for Barr to release the unredacted Mueller report and underlying evidence to Congress.But they also said they were open to discussing a reasonable accommodation with the Justice Department.The letter was also signed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, top Senate Judiciary Committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein and top Senate Intelligence Committee Democrat Mark Warner.Your proposed accommodation - which among other things would prohibit discussion of the full report, even with other committee members - is not acceptable, the Democrats wrote.The lawmakers said access to the full Mueller report and underlying evidence is necessary for Congress to fulfill its constitutional responsibilities.This includes considering whether legislation is needed in light of the findings contained in Special Counsel Muellers report and the attorney generals determination that no prosecution is warranted despite those facts, the letter said.Also on Friday, Nadler issued a subpoena to obtain the full report.
Democrats make legal bid for all Russia probe evidence, Trump poll numbers drop:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats on Friday took legal action to get hold of all of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Muellers evidence from his inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, as the probes findings hit President Donald Trumps poll ratings.The number of Americans who approve of Trump dropped by 3 percentage points to the lowest level of the year following the release of a redacted version of Muellers report on Thursday, according to a Reuters/Ipsos online opinion poll.Mueller did not establish that the Trump campaign coordinated with Russians but did find multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations.While Mueller ultimately decided not to charge Trump with a crime such as obstruction of justice, he also said that the investigation did not exonerate the president, either.U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat, issued a subpoena to the Justice Department to hand over the full Mueller report and other relevant evidence by May 1.My committee needs and is entitled to the full version of the report and the underlying evidence consistent with past practice.The redactions appear to be significant.We have so far seen none of the actual evidence that the Special Counsel developed to make this case, Nadler said in a statement.The report provided extensive details on Trumps efforts to thwart Muellers investigation, giving Democrats plenty of political ammunition against the Republican president but no consensus on how to use it.The document has blacked out sections to hide details about secret grand jury information, U.S. intelligence gathering and active criminal cases as well as potentially damaging information about peripheral players who were not charged.Six top congressional Democrats led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer rejected Attorney General William Barrs offer to give them access to a less-redacted version of the report.In a letter to Barr, they repeated their demand the full report be given to Congress, but said they were open to a reasonable accommodation.Democratic leaders have played down talk of impeachment of Trump just 18 months before the 2020 presidential election, even as some prominent members of the partys progressive wing, notably U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, promised to push the idea.U.S.Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first major contender for the Democratic 2020 presidential nomination to call for the start of impeachment proceedings, saying on Twitter that the severity of this misconduct demands it.To ignore a Presidents repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, she said.CRAZY MUELLER REPORT Trump, who has repeatedly called the Mueller probe a political witch hunt, lashed out again on Friday.Statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report...which are fabricated & totally untrue, Trump wrote on Twitter.He seemed to be referring to former White House counsel Don McGahn who was cited in the report as having annoyed Trump by taking notes of his conversations with the president.Watch out for people that take so-called notes, when the notes never existed until needed.Trump wrote, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the Report about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad).Phone conversations between the president and McGahn in June 2017 were a central part of Muellers depiction of Trump as trying to derail the Russia inquiry.The report said Trump told McGahn to instruct the Justice Department to fire Mueller.McGahn did not carry out the order.In analyzing whether Trump obstructed justice, Mueller revealed details about how the president tried to fire him and limit his investigation, kept details of a June 2016 meeting between senior campaign officials and a Russian under wraps, and possibly dangled a pardon to a former adviser.According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll of 1,005 adults conducted Thursday afternoon to Friday morning, 37 percent of people approve of Trumps performance in office - down from 40 percent in a similar poll conducted on April 15 and matches the lowest level of the year.The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, said the Democrats subpoena is wildly overbroad and would jeopardize a grand jurys investigations.The Mueller inquiry laid bare what U.S. intelligence agencies have described as a Russian campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States, denigrate 2016 Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and boost Trump.Russia said on Friday that Muellers report did not contain any evidence that Moscow had meddled.We, as before, do not accept such allegations, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.Asked on Friday about Russian interference in 2016, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Washington that we will make very clear to them that this is not acceptable behavior.The Mueller Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election is pictured in New York, New York, U.S., April 18, 2019.REUTERS/Carlo Allegri Trump has tried to cultivate good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and came under heavy criticism in Washington last year for saying after meeting Putin that he accepted his denial of election meddling, over the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies.Half a dozen former Trump aides, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, were charged by Muellers office or convicted of crimes during his 22-month-long investigation.The Mueller inquiry spawned a number of other criminal probes by federal prosecutors in New York and elsewhere.OBSTRUCTION One reason it would be difficult to charge Trump is that the Justice Department has a decades-old policy that a sitting president should not be indicted, although the U.S. Constitution is silent on whether a president can face criminal prosecution in court.A paragraph in the report is at the heart of whether Mueller, a former FBI director, intended Congress to pursue further action against Trump.The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the Presidents corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law, Mueller wrote.Republican Collins said Democrats had misconstrued that section of the report to suit their anti-Trump agenda.There seems to be some confusion...This isnt a matter of legal interpretation; its reading comprehension, Collins wrote on Twitter.The report doesnt say Congress should investigate obstruction now.It says Congress can make laws about obstruction under Article I powers, Collins said.Nadler told reporters on Thursday that Mueller probably wrote the report with the intent of providing Congress a road map for future action against the president, but the Democratic congressman said it was too early to talk about impeachment.But the House Oversight Committees Democratic chairman, Elijah Cummings, said impeachment was not ruled out.A lot of people keep asking about the question of impeachment ... We may very well come to that very soon, but right now lets make sure we understand what Mueller was doing, understand what Barr was doing, and see the report in an unredacted form and all of the underlying documents, he told MSNBC.Short of attempting impeachment, Democratic lawmakers can use the details of Muellers report to fuel other inquiries already underway by congressional committees.Slideshow (3 Images) Only two U.S. presidents have been impeached: Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice in 1998 and Andrew Johnson in 1868 after firing his secretary of war in the tumultuous aftermath of the American Civil War.Both were acquitted by the Senate and stayed in office.In 1974, a House committee approved articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon over the Watergate scandal but he resigned before the full House voted on impeachment.(For a 'Link to Mueller report' click here) (For a graphic on 'A closer look at Mueller report redactions' click tmsnrt.rs/2VSx7HZ)
Trump lawyers reviewed Mueller report for 10 hours before it was made public:::::WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumps personal lawyers spent at least 10 hours reviewing Special Counsel Robert Muellers report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election before it was made public, two of the lawyers told Reuters on Friday.FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump's lead attorneys Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani react after Attorney General William Barr sent lawmakers a summary of the key findings in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation, at an office in Washington, U.S., March 24, 2019.Picture taken March 24, 2019.Courtesy of Peter Halmagyi/Handout via REUTERS.Rudy Giuliani, Jay Sekulow and two other Trump lawyers went to the U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday and Wednesday for an early look at the 448-page report into whether Trumps team colluded with Russia and whether Trump obstructed the investigation, which was released to the public on Thursday.Attorney General William Barr, who has drawn criticism from Democratic lawmakers over his handling of the Mueller probe, said on Thursday that both White House counsel and Trumps personal lawyers had been allowed to review the redacted report.Barr gave no details about how much access they were given but Sekulow and Giuliani said they reviewed copies of the report from about 4 p.m. until at least 9 p.m. on Tuesday and from 10:30 a.m. until 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, taking notes on legal pads.The lawyers said they gave up their cellphones and other electronic devices before being led into a Justice Department conference room in a restricted area known as a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), designed to ensure secret information stays secure.We were doing a lot of reading, not talking, Sekulow told Reuters, referring to himself, Giuliani, and Jane and Marty Raskin.I had at least 30 pages of notes, said Giuliani.Sekulow pushed back against Democrats complaints that Barr had tried to help Trump by giving his lawyers an early look at the report.Our client was the subject of an inquiry, Sekulow said, explaining that the team of lawyers sent a note to the Justice Department last week asking to see the report.We believed it was an appropriate request to make.The disclosure followed news reports this week that Justice Department officials discussed Muellers conclusions with White House lawyers before the release.Giuliani said the preview reassured them that the report did not contain any bombshells.It gave us some confidence the people who hate him will hate him, the people who love him will love him, and the people in between were not going to be persuaded, he said.After the first session, the lawyers went back to Sekulows Capitol Hill offices, ordered in Chinese food and created an outline of their own about the most important details in the report, they said.On Wednesday night, they went out for Mexican food.And on Thursday night, after the reports release, they celebrated at the Trump International Hotel in Washington.Although Muellers team described in detail the extensive contact Trumps team had with Russia during the election campaign and how Trump tried to impede the investigation, it stopped short of concluding he had committed a crime or that his aides had conspired with Moscow.The team of personal lawyers was happy with the result.No collusion and no obstruction, Sekulow said, using a phrase often repeated by Trump.

earlier to make as much of Muellers findings public as possible.But that opened him up to widespread criticism from Democrats and some legal experts, who questioned his decision not to charge Trump with obstruction of justice, and accused him of acting like the presidents personal defense lawyer.Muellers report outlined 10 episodes in which Trump tried to get the special counsel fired, limit the scope of his investigation, or otherwise interfere with the probe.Mueller stopped short of concluding that Trump had committed a crime, but did not exonerate him of wrongdoing either, leaving Barr or Congress the option to take action against the Republican president.Some experts said Barr should have brought charges.To me, they laid out a chargeable obstruction case, said Shanlon Wu, a former federal prosecutor who represented Rick Gates, the former Trump deputy campaign chairman who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy and making false statements and is cooperating with the investigation.Barrs news conference, held shortly before the reports release, provided more fodder for his critics.He praised the White Houses cooperation with the investigation and said Trumps public and private efforts to interfere with the probe could have been fueled by a sincere belief that the investigation was propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks.At several points, Barr echoed Trumps mantra that Mueller had found no collusion with Russia.To some, it was a disappointing performance from a man who had been praised for upholding the Justice Departments independence during a previous stint as attorney general from 1991 to 1993.Hes really shown himself to be principally focused on defending the president, said Robert Litt, a former federal prosecutor who had supported Barrs nomination for the job.The top two Democrats in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, accused Barr of deliberately distorting Muellers findings.A Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Barr did not mislead the public because the White House cooperated with the probe despite Trumps numerous statements criticizing it.The official also said Mueller had the choice to either recommend charges against Trump or not, and he had decided against it.Representative Eric Swalwell, one of more than 15 Democrats running for president, called on Barr to resign.Justice Department officials declined to respond to the resignation demand.Rudy Giuliani, Trumps personal lawyer, defended the attorney general.I think Barr is a straight lawyer.Hes an honest man, he told Reuters.EASY ON THE REDACTIONS Democrats had worried that Barr might use too heavy a hand when redacting portions of the report that dealt with sensitive material, such as active investigations, confidential legal proceedings and matters of national security.In the end, only 6 percent of the report was blacked out, according to ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism organization.The redactions seemed to me to be reasonable, said Jack Sharman, a lawyer who worked on the impeachment of Democratic President Bill Clinton during the 1990s.I was a little surprised.Starting next week, 12 top lawmakers and their staffers will be able to see a more complete version in a secure reading room.Still, Barr is sure to face pointed questions when he testifies before Congress in May.Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he had no reason to believe Barrs redactions were not made justifiably and in good faith but he also criticized him for protecting Trump.U.S. Attorney General William Barr speaks at a news conference to discuss Special Counsel

what I consider to be inappropriate PR services for the Trump White House, he said on Friday.To some in Trumps camp, the criticism directed at Barr is a sign of a job well done.Attorney General Barr knew every step of the way that people are going to unload on him today, said Michael Caputo, a former Trump campaign adviser.He had a role to play and he played it.
Democrats may not be learning the right lessons on impeachment:::::Washington (CNN) History can be a wise teacher, but it's also crucial to take the right lessons.Confronted with a should-they-or-shouldn't-they proposal on impeachment, Democrats worry that if they fail to learn history's lessons, they are doomed to repeat them.But while House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed to tamp down plans for impeachment during the conference call, some Democratic presidential candidates sharpened their arguments at CNN's town halls Monday night for moving forward with impeachment proceedings.Polls show most Americans don't favor an impeachment battle and immovable support for Trump among his base, so many Democratic lawmakers are buying into the conventional wisdom that impeachment could consign them to the same fate as 1990s Republicans.But a longer-term look at the fallout from Clinton's impeachment in 1998 may tell a different story than Democrats now seem to be remembering.It's true that House Republicans performed poorly in the midterm polls in the middle of Clinton's impeachment drama a nd that the 42nd president left office with unusually high approval ratings.But less than two years after Clinton escaped with his job from a Senate impeachment trial, Republicans won the presidency after using the outgoing president's morals to underpin their campaign.The other modern presidential election with an impeachment overhang, in 1976, also saw the incumbent party lose to a candidate -- Democrat Jimmy Carter -- implicitly running against scandal.Two years after Richard Nixon left office before he could be impeached over Watergate, Carter won the White House after capturing the anti-Washington mood by telling Americans, " We just want the truth again."History offers contradictory examples for Democratic leaders, such as Pelosi, who has her own memories of impeachment as a rising star of the 1990s and held the conference call with her members on Monday to discuss next steps.Of course, the overriding question should be whether the actions of a President demand impeachment because they meet the constitutional bar of high crimes and misdemeanors, not whether the process could bring partisan advantage."There are some decisions that are bigger than politics," Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts recently said, invoking loftier motives even as she sought a political payoff by becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to call for Trump's impeachment after the Mueller report.Warren consolidated her argument in a CNN town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Monday night."There is no political inconvenience exception to the United States Constitution," Warren said."If any other human being in this country had done what's documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail."Another Democratic candidate, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, adopted a similar position to Warren at the same town hall event, amid growing differences between 2020 hopefuls and Democratic leaders in the House."I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment," Harris said.Another 2020 contender Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called for an "objective" investigation in the House but warned that constant impeachment talk could distract from Democratic priorities like health care, raising the minimum wage and tackling climate change.No case to answer JUST WATCHED Tim Ryan: Pretty clear Trump obstructed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tim Ryan: Pretty clear Trump obstructed 02:18 Trump's defenders argue that Mueller's failure to establish conspiracy between the President's 2016 campaign team and Russia and lack of a decision on whether Trump obstructed justice mean that impeachment would be a frivolous and unjustified process.Some are also warning Democrats they would face a backlash if they go ahead.After Mueller's effort revealed Trump's pattern of lying and use of his presidential power to thwart investigations, few Democrats question whether Trump deserves to be impeached.But the debate is turning not on the question of Trump's guilt but on whether Democrats think impeachment is a smart political idea.One Democratic argument from before the release of the redacted Mueller report last week is that Democrats would play into Trump's hands by impeaching him.The Senate GOP majority would protect the President from conviction in an impeachment trial and the process would unify Republicans and electrify Trump's 2020 base.Advocates of this position point to what happened when the Republicans impeached Clinton in 1998.In the subsequent midterm elections, Democrats bucked historic trends and picked up five seats, a shock win that contributed to Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich losing his job.The result was seen as a referendum on Republican overreach after Clinton was impeached for committing perjury and obstruction of justice following a scandal arising out of his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.It also suggests to some 21st-century Democrats what can happen when a party puts an attempt to destroy a presidency before issues that voters most care about."With President Clinton, the impeachment proceedings became a proxy for the election," Democratic Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts told CNN's Dana Bash on Monday."(Clinton's) popularity went up.Some of it was sympathy, some of it was the facts that people saw that impeachment proceeding as a proxy for his worthiness for being elected.""If the next two years becomes about impeachment instead of about judging the President on his first term....I think it may play into President Trump's hands for reelection," he said.JUST WATCHED Sen Elizabeth Warren calls for House to start impeachment proceedings against Trump Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sen Elizabeth Warren calls for House to start impeachment proceedings against Trump 02:36 Polling may support Lynch's position since the re is no data that suggests the Mueller report is the top issue for voters on either side of the political divide.Given the polarization of the Trump era, Mueller's conclusions are also unlikely to change the voting preferences of the most committed partisans.Maybe it's not worth risking the votes of anyone left in the shrunken political middle ground with a long impeachment drama.The evidence of the 2000 election does suggest that there is precedent for draining months of scandal and high-profile congressional investigations to have a detrimental impact on the party holding power.In the 2000 presidential election, Republican nominee George W. Bush -- who branded himself as an outsider despite his presidential lineage -- repeatedly vowed to restore "honor and dignity to the White House" as he jammed the Democratic nominee -- Vice President Al Gore -- over Clinton's behavior.The tactic played on voter fatigue of eight years of Clinton scandals, including the impeachment saga, internal White House controversies and allegations of illegal fundraising -- and even the ethics questions that swirled around Gingrich and other Republicans.But the message's potency lay in its deft, implicit reference to impeachment.Bush used the attack to leave Gore with an unpalatable choice of renouncing the man he hoped to succeed and carrying the can for his improprieties."If he's got a problem with what went on in the past, he ought to explain what it is," Bush told reporters in 2000 in a clear reference to the Lewinsky scandal.In the end, Gore was never able to find a way to benefit from Clinton's popularity and to insulate himself from lingering questions about his morality and Bush won a disputed election that was eventually settled by the Supreme Court.Impeaching Clinton did not hurt the GOP in subsequent elections either, since the party outperformed in the 2002 midterms and retained the presidency in 2004, though the dynamics of those two elections were largely shaped by the trauma of 9/11.One difference in the current scenario is that the scandal-tainted President is expected to be on the ballot himself in 2020 -- and Trump has shown a staggering capacity to sidestep even the most damaging political scandals.While red state senators would love to save Trump in a Senate trial, such a vote would be politically damaging for Republican senators up for re-election in presidential swing states Impeachment may not be 'worth it' JUST WATCHED George Conway calls for Trump's impeachment Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH George Conway calls for Trump's impeachment 03:47 But many top Democrats seem to have made up their minds on impeachment even before the redacted Mueller report was released last Thursday.While they want to avoid the worst risks of an impeachment saga, Democrats also want to reap the benefits of Mueller's unflattering account of Trump's behavior.For now, they are pursuing a hybrid approach by holding a series of high-profile hearings with eye-catching witnesses and probing the President's alleged obstruction.In many ways this is going through the motions of impeachment without the end result, in an attempt to frame a case to voters that Trump is unfit to serve a second term."While our views range from proceeding to investigate the findings of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth," Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues on Monday."It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the President accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings," she added.Pelosi doesn't have the luxury of waiting for history's verdict as she plots the Democratic strategy over the next 18 months until Election Day.If she chooses to avoid impeachment and Democrats put a new president in the White House, she will be vindicated.But if Trump wins reelection despite the choking cloud of scandal around his White House, Democrats may question why they didn't try to mortally wound him politically when they had the chance.
White House tells official not to comply with Democratic subpoena over security clearances:::::(CNN) The White House has instructed a former official who was in charge of the security clearance process to not comply with a House subpoena demanding his appearance for an interview, the latest move by the Trump administration to thwart Democratic-led investigations into all aspects of the presidency.After a day of tense negotiations, the White House late Monday told the former official, Carl Kline , who now works at the Defense Department, to not appear at Tuesday's deposition, contending that Democrats were seeking access to confidential information that should be off limits.The move raises the prospect that the House Oversight Committee could seek to hold Kline in contempt, a step that Chairman Elijah Cummings warned Monday he would take.And it's the latest White House effort to stonewall Democratic investigations, coming the same day the Trump Organization filed a lawsuit to prevent an accounting firm from complying with Cummings' subpoena for President Donald Trump's past financial records.Michael Purpura, deputy counsel to Trump, argued that Cummings' subpoena of Kline "unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests," according to a letter obtained by CNN.Kline's attorney, Robert Driscoll, said his client would listen to his employer.Read More
Republican lawmaker sees less-redacted Mueller report:::::Washington (CNN) Democrats have rebuffed the Justice Department's offer to see a less-redacted -- but not fully unredacted -- version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report, but that didn't stop at least one Republican from reading the additional material.Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, went to the Justice Department Monday morning to read the less-redacted Mueller report in the department's secure spaces.Leaving the department, Collins said nothing he read on Monday changed the results of Mueller's report finding of "no collusion" and deciding not to charge President Donald Trump for obstruction of justice."Nothing that I saw today at the end of the day though changed Mr. Mueller's decision," Collins said.Collins appears to be the first lawmaker to read the less-redacted version of the Mueller report, which was made available to congressional party leaders and the heads of the House and Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees.Read More
Live updates: CNN's town halls with 2020 Democrats:::::Buttigieg on Monday declined to engage with a Trump administration official who accused him of pushing a "hate hoax" during his back-and-forth with Vice President Mike Pence.The US ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, on Monday accused Buttigieg of using the feud to further his presidential candidacy, saying it was "along the lines of Jussie Smollett."Faced with the words of Grenell, who is also gay, Buttigieg paused and parried."I'm not a master fisherman," the South Bend mayor said to applause, "but I know bait when I see it and I'm not gonna take it."Buttigieg and Pence have sparred in the press over the past couple weeks."If me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade," Buttigieg said at the LGBTQ Victory Fund National Champagne Brunch in Washington earlier this month."And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand.That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me -- your quarrel, sir, is with my creator."Pence, during his time as governor of Indiana, signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a controversial bill that effectively allowed businesses to discriminate against gay customers.In a subsequent interview with CNN, Pence said, "I hope that Pete will offer more to the American people than attacks on my Christian faith or attacks on the President as he seeks the highest office in the land," adding, "he'd do well to reflect on the importance of respecting the freedom of religion of every American."
Pete Buttigieg: 'God doesn't have a political party':::::(CNN) Pete Buttigieg opened up about his faith Monday night, expressing confidence that he will be able to unite many different groups of people because "God does not have a political party."During a CNN town hall in New Hampshire Monday, the South Bend, Indiana, mayor was asked how he planned to unite conservatives, moderates and liberal Christians."It can be challenging to be a person of faith who's also part of the LGBTQ community and yet, to me, the core of faith is regard for one another," Buttigieg said."And part of God's love is experienced, according to my faith tradition, is in the way that we support one another and, in particular, support the least among us."That is where his faith is radically different than the faith-centric messages that come from the current White House, he said.Buttigieg said his faith counsels him to be humble and look after people who need defending.Read More
Elizabeth Warren says she won't get 'Hillary'd' in 2020:::::(CNN) Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has no intention of being "Hillary'd" in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.That was the phrase, used as shorthand by a student asking about sexist attacks during a CNN town hall Monday night, that prompted Warren to recall her successful 2012 campaign to unseat Republican Sen. Scott Brown.It was a campaign, Warren said, that almost never happened.Democrats were telling her she ought to run, that she'd make a great senator.But there was a catch: Most of them were confident Warren would lose, and didn't mind telling her."People said to me, you're going to lose because Massachusetts in 2011, according to conventional wisdom, was not ready to have a woman senator or governor.We never had and people said it's just not going to happen, not at least for another generation," she said."I heard that," Warren remembered on Monday, "as 'Get in this race, right now.'Which is what I did."Read More
Kamala Harris on Trump: 'I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment':::::(CNN) Sen. Kamala Harris said Monday that she supports Congress moving towards impeachment, a step further than the California Democrat has gone in the past on whether President Donald Trump should be impeached.Harris' comment at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire comes amid a growing debate among Democrats over whether the House should move to impeach the President in the wake of special counsel Robert Mueller releasing his report on Russian intervention in the 2016 election and Trump's efforts to obstruct the investigation."I think we have very good reason to believe that there is an investigation that has been conducted which has produced evidence that tells us that this President and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice," Harris said."I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment."Harris added: "I believe that we need to get rid of this President.That's why I'm running to become president of the United States.That is part of the premise, obviously, of my plan."For months, Democrats have not made impeachment a premier issue in their pitch to voters.But Mueller's report has upped the ante on the issue, causing candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro to call for impeachment proceedings against Trump.Read More
Takeaways from Amy Klobuchar's CNN town hall:::::(CNN) Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar urged a more cautious approach than many of her Democratic rivals on impeachment, health care, college tuition, and student loans on Monday night in New Hampshire .Klobuchar was the first of five of the party's 2020 presidential contenders to participate in back-to-back town halls hosted by CNN.Here are four takeaways from her appearance: Riding the caution lane Perhaps more than any other Democratic candidate, Klobuchar has staked out the moderate lane in this crowded race for the party's nomination in 2020.That was immediately evident in her CNN town hall Monday night when she essentially declined to answer questions about whether the Mueller report offered grounds to impeach President Donald Trump.In her dodge, she said Trump should be held accountable and called some of his behavior detailed in the report "appalling," but wasn't exactly clear about what the consequences should be -- beyond congressional hearings and bringing Mueller before the Senate to testify.Klobuchar noted that impeachment originates in the House, and that the Senate's role is that of a jury.In measured tones, she noted that she is waiting to see all the evidence as a former prosecutor, and said Americans could see justice through the varied investigations that continue into Trump's conduct.Closing the loop, she said the third way to hold Trump accountable "is by defeating him in the 2020 election -- and I believe I can do that."She won't win the hearts of the most ardent (and enraged) Democratic activists with that answer, but she's staking out a position that would put her on safer ground with independents and moderates who will be key in the general election.'I have to be straight with you' Klobuchar continued to tack to the center when she cast college tuition and student loan debt forgiveness proposals from other candidates as unrealistic.Instead, she offered a narrower set of proposals, including expanding Pell Grants, allowing students to refinance their loans and pushing for free community college."I wish I could staple a free college diploma under every one of your chairs.I do.Don't look.It's not there," she told the audience in New Hampshire."I wish I could do that, but I have to be straight with you and tell you the truth."Purple state cred Klobuchar highlighted her history of winning big in a purple state -- including last year, when she said she won 40 of the counties that Trump had won in 2016 when he came within two percentage points of victory in Minnesota.She said she earned voters' trust by "going not just where it's comfortable, but where it's uncomfortable" -- including farms and small-town cafes.The approach makes sense: Polls have consistently shown Democratic primary voters are much more focused on their candidates' electability than they have been in previous presidential races.But does it inspire?"Every single time I have run, I have won every single congressional district in my state, including Michele Bachmann's, OK?"Klobuchar said.When the comment was met by silence, she coaxed out applause by adding: "That's when you guys are supposed to cheer, OK?"The light touch If you look at Klobuchar's standing near the bottom of the polls, one thing she needs is a few more breakout moments, like the one she had shutting down then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's questions about drinking during his confirmation hearings last year.She showed, back then and in candid moments on the trail, that she's got a quick wit and a light touch that can go over well with voters.She showed that in a mini-moment Monday night when she playfully accused CNN anchor Chris Cuomo of creeping over her shoulder as she tried to finish answering a question."Not in a Trumpian manner," she said slyly -- cautioning Cuomo that she wasn't finished with her answer.The Minnesota senator was, of course, alluding to the famous moment in the Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump debates when the then-Republican candidate seemed stalking Hillary Clinton on stage as he encroached on her personal space in one of their rounds.Many female voters really didn't like that.It remains a vivid memory for some who still bring it up in interviews on the trail when they talk about their worries in nominating another woman to face Trump.Every time Klobuchar can signal to audiences that she'd hold her ground if faced with that kind of behavior from Trump, it's a good moment for her -- even if her joke was at Cuomo's expense.
Sanders says the right to vote should be extended 'even for terrible people':::::(CNN) Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said he thinks everyone should have the right to vote -- even the Boston Marathon bomber.Asked at a CNN town hall Monday night if he thought felons should be allowed to vote -- even while they're incarcerated, not just after they're released -- Sanders said the country needs more people to vote."This is a democracy and we have got to expand that democracy, and I believe every single person does have the right to vote," he said.Sanders started his answer by pointing out the low rate of voter turnout in the United States when compared to other major democracies around the world.He said one of the primary priorities of his campaign is to make the US a "vibrant" democracy with a much higher voter turnout.And, Sanders said, enfranchising people like Dzhokhar Tsarnaev -- the US citizen who helped bomb the Boston Marathon in 2013, killing three and injuring hundreds of others -- is a part of that.Read More
Buttigieg on Trump official's 'hate hoax' criticism: 'I'm not a master fisherman, but I know bait when I see it':::::(CNN) Pete Buttigieg refused to engage when asked about a Trump administration official who accused him of pushing a "hate hoax" during a back and forth with Vice President Mike Pence.US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell last week accused the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and Democratic presidential hopeful of using the feud to further his presidential candidacy, saying it was "along the lines of Jussie Smollett."When asked about Grennell's words during a CNN town hall Monday night, Buttigieg paused and parried."I'm not a master fisherman, but I know bait when I see it, and I'm not gonna take it," the mayor said to applause.Buttigieg was asked about the comments by CNN's Anderson Cooper at the event in New Hampshire.Read More
Ringleader of North Korean Embassy raid in hiding from hit squads, attorney says:::::Washington (CNN) The head of a shadowy North Korean dissident group wanted by US authorities for his connection to the raid on Pyongyang's embassy in Madrid in February is in hiding from North Korean hit squads, his attorney told CNN on Monday.Adrian Hong, the leader of the group, Cheollima Civil Defense, was not in his apartment when US marshals arrived on Thursday and his lawyer, Lee Wolosky, said he does not know his client's current location.Video of the encounter shared with CNN by a source close to Hong shows six uniformed officers entering the unit and shouting "police" before beginning a search.US authorities' interest in Hong is not publicly known, but another Cheollima Civil Defense associate, Christopher Ahn, was arrested Thursday in Los Angeles on a provisional warrant from Madrid, law enforcement officials said."He certainly fears for his safety.We do have reason to believe that North Korean hit squads have been dispatched to target Mr. Hong and perhaps others, and he is taking necessary steps to evade those hit squads," Wolosky said.A Spanish judge last month said Hong was the ringleader of a group of ten men that carried out the embassy raid, which was described in court documents as a violent encounter.According to Spanish court documents, Hong and other members of Cheollima Civil Defense beat and handcuffed embassy employees before taking a senior official to a basement room and urging him to defect from North Korea.Members of the dissident group escaped from the compound in embassy vehicles with two thumb drives, two computers and two hard drives, the court documents say.Cheollima Civil Defense, whose stated goal is to overthrow the Kim regime, has confirmed it was behind the raid but denied it gagged or beat any of the embassy employees.They say they were invited into the embassy.Wolosky admits his client's involvement in the raid and said the group was not violent.Wolosky described the group, which he said now wants to be called the "Provisional Government of Free Joseon," as a "magnet for defectors, who contact them in a variety of ways in all places around the globe."Cheollima Civil Defense said in a statement last month that it shared "certain information of enormous potential value with the FBI in the United States, under mutually agreed terms of confidentiality."The FBI referred CNN to the Department of Justice for comment.Ahn is in detention in Los Angeles ahead of a second hearing in federal court there Tuesday afternoon.It's not clear what he is charged with because his case remains under seal, but an online scheduling page for the case lists it as related to an extradition.A public defender listed for Ahn has not responded to a request for comment.Ahn is a former marine and previously worked with Cheollima Civil Defense when it helped move the son of Kim Jong Un's half brother to a safe site after Kim allegedly ordered that half brother's murder two years ago, according to Wolosky."He is an American hero," Wolosky said."He deserves much better treatment than is currently being provided to him by the US government, which is housing him in federal detention in Los Angeles."Wolosky said US authorities have given him "no assurances" about where they want to send Ahn, and called it "outrageous" that the US government appeared to be acting based on criminal complaints emanating from North Korea.The Department of Justice would not comment on Ahn's or Hong's cases but a spokeswoman on Friday noted that the US would generally need to give permission for a country requesting the extradition of an individual to send that person to a third country."We are asking the president and the secretary of state, who has a direct role in the extradition process, to stop this and to stop it immediately.Let these men go back to serving their country, the United States, and to work toward a free and democratic North Korea as they have been doing.Let them go back to their families and let them go back to their service," Wolosky said.CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the name of Adrian Hong.
New poll shows Pete Buttigieg surging into top tier in New Hampshire with Biden and Sanders:::::(CNN) Support for Pete Buttigieg jumped 14 points in a new Granite State Poll from the University of New Hampshire, launching him into the first-in-the-nation primary state's top tier of candidates.The poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire's The Survey Center, shows the young mayor of South Bend, Indiana, joining Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden at the top of the increasingly large Democratic presidential pack.Sanders and Biden have generally been dominating the field in national and state polling since the cycle began.Sanders has been top of the list since last year in New Hampshire in the University of New Hampshire's polling, helped by its close proximity to his home state of Vermont, with three-in-ten likely Democratic primary voters saying they'll vote for him.While Biden usually dominates national surveys, he comes in second in New Hampshire, with 18%.Buttigieg rounds out the top tier of candidates with 15%.It's another strong showing in a recent poll for Buttigieg, who has gone from being a mostly unknown Midwestern mayor to one of the spring's hottest names in the Democratic presidential race.Polls from the last two months show the Hoosier is consistently finishing in third in early state polls behind Sanders and Biden.Read More
US threatens to veto UN resolution on helping rape victims, over mentions of reproductive health:::::(CNN) The US delegation to the United Nations has threatened to veto a resolution aiming to prevent rape as a weapon of war and to help its victims, because the resolution contains language about "sexual and reproductive health," sources confirmed to CNN.A UN-based source told CNN the US seems to have a "red line" when it came to mentioning sexual and reproductive health in a broad resolution that saw the US breaking from its traditional allies and threatening to derail the measure.The proposal called on the global institution to reaffirm and renew its opposition to sexual violence.A copy of the draft UN Security Council resolution obtained by CNN shows the potential changes to the document, marked in the margins by a member of the German delegation to the UN, in an attempt to satisfy the US' problems with it, according to multiple sources.The edits, marked by Andreas Glossner, vice chair of the UN's Commission on the Status of Women, include removing references to "health services" and the "sexual and reproductive health" of victims of sexual violence.The Trump administration has taken measures to avoid supporting efforts and organizations that provide abortion services to women, including victims of rape, and sources say such language is now viewed by the US as a veiled reference to that.Read More
Nancy Pelosi pleads for patience:::::Washington (CNN) Famed philosopher W.

High school journalists take on Betsy DeVos in editorial after being barred from event:::::(CNN) Kentucky high school student journalists penned an editorial taking on Betsy DeVos after they say security turned them away from an event held on a public college campus that featured the secretary of education.In an editorial titled "No Seat at the Roundtable," student journalists attending Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, Kentucky, say they were barred from covering the event last Wednesday because they didn't have an invitation."We are student journalists who wanted to cover an event in our community featuring the Secretary of Education, but ironically, we couldn't get in without an invitation," the editorial posted on the student newspaper's website, the PLD Lamplighter, reads."Doesn't open press imply open to ALL press including students?"the editorial asks.In the editorial, the high school students wondered why the information about the event was shared "a little more than 24 hours before the event," and wrote: "When the Secretary of Education is visiting your city, you'd think you'd have a little more of a heads up.""We can't help but suspect that the intention was to prevent people from attending," they continued."Also, it was held at 11 a.m. on a Wednesday.What student or educator is free at that time?"The event, which also featured Kentucky Gov.Matt Bevin, was held at the Bluegrass Community Technical College's Newtown campus and was billed as a "Roundtable on Education Freedom Scholarships."The students said they heard about the event the day before, on April 16, from social media and local news reports and "immediately began making plans to be there because as young journalists, we appreciate any opportunity received to demonstrate our professionalism.""These types of events are where we learn, and chances like this do not come around often," they wrote.A spokesperson for the college, Michelle Sjogren, told the student newspaper that its security personnel for the event "were working off of instructions from Secretary DeVos' team. ""They were told there was an invitation list," Sjogren told the paper."The instructions we were given were that whoever is coming in needs to be on the list."Sjogren continued: "They're doing their job, and we're doing our job."Department of Education press secretary Liz Hill told CNN she was on site for the event and said she was "never made aware, nor was anyone from the secretary's staff made aware that student journalists were attempting to attend the event.""We welcome all journalists who RSVP to our events," Hill said.She continued: "All journalists are required to RSVP, but if someone had come up to me and said, 'Hey we've got student journalists who'd like to come in,' they would've been more than welcome.We've never turned away student journalists at any event that we've ever done."
Warren on impeaching Trump: If anyone else did what he did, 'they would be arrested and put in jail':::::(CNN) Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren detailed Monday why she supports impeaching President Donald Trump, arguing "if any other human being in this country had done what's documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail."Warren argued in a CNN town hall Monday that special counsel Robert Mueller's report gave Congress a road map for impeaching the President and "serves up" a moment for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings."He serves the whole thing up to the United States Congress and says in effect, if there's going to be any accountability, that accountability has to come from the Congress," Warren said."And the tool that we are given for that accountability is the impeachment process.This is not about politics; this is about principle."On Friday, Warren called on the House of Representatives to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump.Warren, like several other Democrats, previously had been saying she would need to see Mueller's full report before deciding whether Congress should consider impeachment.Warren posted on Twitter on Friday, "To ignore a President's repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways."Read More
Kamala Harris promises swift executive action if Congress doesn't pass gun control legislation:::::(CNN) Sen. Kamala Harris on Monday pledged that, if elected President, she would take executive action enacting sweeping gun control measures if Congress fails to send comprehensive legislation to her desk in her first 100 days."Enough," says the fact sheet outlining the proposals that the campaign plans to unveil publicly tomorrow."We're not waiting any longer."The pledge by Harris to act unilaterally by executive action sharpens her repeated calls on the campaign trail, blasting Congress for failing to act on gun violence, especially mass shootings.Last weekend at her town hall in Orangeburg, South Carolina, Harris told the crowd, "It is a false choice to suggest you are either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away.We need leaders in Washington, D.C., who have the courage to speak the truth."The plan, as outlined in her proposal, aims to move closer to federal universal background checks, a first-step move the campaign calls "mandated near-universal background checks."The campaign says this 100-day pledge is just part of the gun safety agenda Harris will pursue as President.Read More
Trump claims 'nobody disobeys my orders,' defying Mueller's account:::::"Nobody disobeys my orders," Trump said during a walkabout on the South Lawn for the annual Easter egg roll.He was questioned by CNN's Kaitlan Collins about whether he was worried some of his staff were shrugging off his requests, as depicted by Mueller, whose full redacted report was made public last week.The document contained anecdote after anecdote of aides refusing to carry out some of Trump's demands to short-circuit the special counsel's investigation.The trend was so marked the report's authors made note of it in their assessment."The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests," the report read Read More
Top Democrats tamp down impeachment talk on call after Pelosi pens letter:::::Washington (CNN) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed to tamp down plans for impeachment during a call with her Democratic colleagues Monday after penning a letter acknowledging the divide in her caucus over it, instead saying they should be focusing on "two words, duty and democracy."According to multiple sources on the call, Pelosi also reiterated what she's said publicly: Democrats shouldn't impeach for political reasons and shouldn't not impeach for political reasons.Rep. Maxine Waters, a major proponent of impeachment, told her colleagues she supports it but isn't organizing an effort to push it or asking others to join her.House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said impeachment is an issue that will be discussed soberly and only based on what's in the best interest of the country, not what's in the best interest of the party, according to the sources on the call.One Democrat -- Jared Huffman -- said that while lawmakers are looking at risks of impeachment, they also need to look at and consider the consequences of not impeaching Trump.Read More
Former CIA deputy director makes 'Game of Thrones' cameo:::::Washington (CNN) A former CIA officer was quietly lurking in the Winterfell soup line during Sunday's episode of HBO's "Game of Thrones."That officer was former Deputy Director David S. Cohen, who made a surprise brief cameo as an unnamed resident of Winterfell.While Cohen may have hoped his intelligence background would prompt show writers to cast him in a more prominent role maybe that of a Faceless Man he was ultimately given the job of playing a nondescript Northerner.While Cohen did not have any lines, he was served a bowl of soup by Ser Davos Seaworth, played by actor Liam Cunningham, as Winterfell prepared for the impending arrival of the Night King and his army of the dead.The CIA revealed Cohen's cameo in a tweet.Read More
John Roberts faces another test with census case:::::Washington (CNN) Chief Justice John Roberts has tried to offer ballast in today's political turmoil, asserting the independence of the judiciary and rebuking President Donald Trump's suggestion that Republican justices will automatically rule for him, and Democratic ones will do the opposite.Now the Supreme Court faces a high-profile test of a major Trump agenda item and the question is how Roberts' declaration of independence, along with his new role at the ideological center of the court, might affect the tone of Tuesday's oral arguments and an ultimate decision affecting the 2020 census.In dispute is whether Census forms will, at the direction of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, include a citizenship question .Census Bureau officials have predicted the inquiry would lead to a lower response rate and an undercount of Hispanic and non-citizen households.The result could be a loss of federal funding and political power for mainly Democratic states and cities.As in last year's controversy over the Muslim travel ban, the census dispute centers on a Trump policy that lower court judges not only declared invalid but the product of suspicious justification.Last year, Roberts in the end took the lead to uphold the travel ban affecting majority-Muslim countries.The court looked past Trump statements revealing animus toward Muslims and favored executive prerogatives in the national security context.The citizenship question is more directly related to political power and Republican versus Democratic interests.As such, the stakes for the court's reputation as a neutral player and the simmering conflict of Roberts versus Trump are even higher.The case's importance is reflected in the nearly 50 "friend of the court" briefs filed at the high court, most on the side of the challengers, including from a group of former US trial court judges who warn, perhaps with an eye to Roberts, that the integrity of the judiciary hangs in the balance.Urging the justices to defer to US District Court Judge Jesse Furman's findings regarding duplicitous Commerce Department explanations for the citizenship question, the former judges wrote that "reaffirming the legitimacy and competence of trial courts is particularly critical today" as the judicial system is under attack.When Furman ruled, he observed that the Constitution requires the government to count every person in the United States, irrespective of the person's citizenship status.Pointing up the consequences of a decennial census, he said, "The population count derived from that effort is used not only to apportion [US] Representatives among the states but also to draw political districts and allocate power within them.And it is used to allocate hundreds of billions of dollars in federal, state, and local funds."In its appeal, the Trump administration argues that the Supreme Court should not even address whether the Commerce Department acted arbitrarily in adding the citizenship question as Furman had ruled.Administration lawyers say the Commerce Secretary has "virtually unlimited discretion" over the census form, largely because no manageable standards exist to evaluate the propriety of questions.The challengers, more than a dozen Democrat-dominated states and cities led by the New York attorney general, rely on an opinion written last year by Roberts that said agency action was subject to a "strong presumption" of judicial review .The challengers also cite a 1992 opinion by now-retired Justice John Paul Stevens that said judicial review helps ensure public confidence in the census and "strengthen this mainstay of our democracy."Roberts' new role on the court The retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy last year, and Trump's appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to succeed him, hardened the Supreme Court's 5-4, conservative-liberal split.It also put Roberts, long to the right of Kennedy, at the ideological median point.At the same time, the tumultuous Kavanaugh confirmation hearings last fall prompted increased public concerns about the high court's independence.Responding to that atmosphere, Roberts shortly after Kavanaugh was confirmed in October stressed that, as justices, "we do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle, we do not caucus in separate rooms, we do not serve one party or one interest.We serve one nation."Then in November, Roberts countered a Trump complaint that an "Obama judge" had ruled against the administration."We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges," Roberts said in a statement."What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them."Whether that ideal is a reality may be disproportionately in Roberts' hands because he is now at the crucial middle of the high court.Already this term, he has moved slightly to the left.In February, for example, he cast the fifth vote, with the four liberals, to block a strict Louisiana abortion regulation .The disputed law was similar to a Texas law invalidated by the high court in 2016, over a Roberts dissent.Tensions on the court From the start, the census case has splintered Supreme Court justices.In a series of orders late last year, they declined to interfere with the start of Furman's trial but blocked him from obtaining testimony from Ross about his explanations for adding the citizenship question.When Ross announced the decision in spring 2018, he said question would help ensure enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.He said that the Justice Department had asked that the question be added, but he later acknowledged, after email evidence was revealed as part of the New York lawsuit, that he had earlier consulted with White House adviser Steve Bannon.In November, the justices issued a brief order saying they would hear the Trump administration appeal regarding evidence Furman was using in the case.But before the justices could hold their hearing -- oral arguments were scheduled for February -- Judge Furman ruled.In a 277-page January opinion covering a multitude of evidentiary and legal issues, Furman found Ross' decision to be "arbitrary and capricious" in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act.The Trump administration's appeal is backed by "friend of the court" filings from the Republican National Committee, several Republican-controlled states and such conservative organizations as Citizens United.Led by the Oklahoma attorney general, the Republican state officials said Furman wrongly accepted assertions that people might decline to reveal their citizenship status out of fear of legal action."But irrational fears cannot be the basis for holding that a census question is invalidlest every census question beyond simple enumeration be invalidated," the Republican state officials argued, adding that "both as a practical matter and as a result of robust legal protections, answering any census question poses zero risk to census respondents."Joining the Democrat-dominated challengers are civil rights groups, the former judges, and former Census Bureau directors, among others.Five former Census Bureau directors who served under both Democratic and Republican administrations expressed concerns in their brief that the citizenship query, as an untested "last-minute addition," could significantly drive down participation.More fundamentally, they insisted, "given today's cynicism about government," the census could become perceived "as a political exercise rather than an important part of our civic life."
What we learned watching Robert Mueller for 18 months:::::(CNN) Editor's Note: When special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed to investigate Russian meddling in the US election, CNN, like most news organizations, endeavored to learn what we could about the famously secretive team's work.So, in addition to other newsgathering efforts, CNN had journalists who stood outside their offices.Journalists often call this a stakeout.Here, the CNN team lays out the backstory of their assignment and how this investment of time yielded big journalistic returns.The first challenge for CNN's nearly 18-month stakeout of special counsel Robert Mueller was finding the man himself.It all started on a chilly autumn morning in 2017, watching the sun rise over southwest Washington.After a day of staking out what we suspected to be Mueller's base of operations, a man with a red backpack crossed the street.Peter Carr was known as Mueller's spokesman, and he unwittingly led us to paydirt: a set of glass doors leading to a plain office building -- a classic example of the form in a part of town that was once an industrial hub but is now full of concrete and glass office buildings.Over the next year, we glued ourselves to the various entrances to try to catch a glimpse of the comings and goings of the major and minor players involved in the investigation.Eventually, we discovered when Mueller zipped into work in his signature silver Subaru, and identified his team of prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff who also drove or walked into the special counsel's office.There were garages, loading docks, front doors -- all part of the office complex.But we couldn't be at the garage and the front door at the same time to catch everything.Often, it was a gamble about where to stand and watch and risk missing something important.Spotting Mueller beyond his daily entrance and exit in his car was difficult.And then, about a year after CNN started staking out Mueller's office regularly, out of the corner of our eyes, through the lobby window, a tall, silver-haired man came out from one hallway.Two seconds later, he disappeared into another hallway.We ran to the side to the garage to see if we could catch the man leaving.Success.There he was -- the elusive Robert Mueller, spotted not just coming and leaving through the garage but in the lobby.So the coffee shop became "our spot."Not just to see Mueller.If we were perched at the right seat, we could partially see into the building's lobby and catch glimpses of people coming and going.Not to mention the special counsel team coming in and out of the cafe themselves given its proximity and convenience.It was a key moment for the four of us -- two different pairs of CNN reporters over the course of the 22-month investigation -- who took shifts in the daily routine of standing outside the garage and office building and sitting inside the coffee shop, observing the movements of various prosecutors and FBI personnel, marking the times and sending dispatches back to CNN's Washington bureau to help inform, and in some cases, advance the broader story.A passerby at one point jokingly dubbed the CNN team 'TMZ', after the site that makes ample use of paparazzi.But the point wasn't to ambush people by snapping pictures.The point was to help the public know what its government was doing.Time and time again, CNN was able to penetrate the wall of secrecy surrounding Mueller's team thanks to key observations and break news about what the special counsel was up to, from former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort's cooperation sessions to the secret indictment of Roger Stone The work was sometimes thrilling, often monotonous and always continued no matter rain, sleet or snow.Countless hours were spent watching, and by extension, listening -- to music, podcasts, Russian talk radio for one journalist, or Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow's daily radio show in hopes of hearing something Mueller-related -- to pass the time.Even though the stakeouts could be exhausting, there were moments when the full weight of the responsibility would hit us.Often we were the only journalistic eyes and ears on the ground at Mueller's office -- not just for all of CNN, but all of the world.It was history.JUST WATCHED What's in the Mueller report?CNN breaks it down Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What's in the Mueller report?CNN breaks it down 07:37 The daily plan Our mornings followed a pretty standard routine: one of us would arrive around 6:50 a.m., set up our camera by the garage, and look for Mueller and his team to arrive.Often at least one prosecutor or FBI agent beat Mueller into the office.Most came by car, but some walked in from a nearby Metro station.One frequently rode a motorized scooter.By mid-morning, we would move to the front entrance of the building, where a courtyard separated us from visitors, defense counsel and possible witnesses.We took hundreds of photographs of strangers we thought looked "lawyerly" entering and leaving the premises, and we were always on the lookout for clues.At lunch, we waited for prosecutors and FBI personnel to emerge for Korean BBQ or Mexican food at the nearby food trucks, and sandwiches at the coffee shop.The daily lunch hour was our opportunity to spot anyone we had missed that morning and conduct a final headcount of who did or didn't show up to work that day.Afternoons were generally slower -- though not always.Finally, by 5 p.m., we would sweep the area, check for any departures and then head out.Of course, we were not invisible -- that wasn't the aim.And while the special counsel team was famously tight-lipped, sometimes they had questions for us.On one federal holiday, prosecutor Aaron Zebley with the special counsel's office stopped to ask us if Mueller had yet to arrive, knowing we probably had the answer.(We did -- Mueller wasn't in yet.)But the team was guarded, respecting their boss' serious "no leak" policy.Questions about the investigation were off the table.Polite hellos and 'how are yous' were the only things exchanged.(The special counsel's office is aware of this story.)Sometimes journalists from other organizations were there, often not.And we were right in the middle of it, even if we were just standing on the sidewalk.Paul Manafort and the ice cream social There was a rhythm to Mueller's office -- so changes from the ordinary helped us decipher what was happening.Like on September 13, 2018, when there was free ice cream in the plaza.Mueller's team was approaching a deal with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, but you never would have known it from the tiki-themed ice cream event the building management threw in the courtyard.The courtyard outside of Mueller's office was full of people -- including members of the special counsel team like Carr, prosecutor Michael Dreeben, and several FBI agents -- who all came down for free scoops.Carr even returned for seconds.Then, a big clue.At 2:40 p.m., when a paralegal who we knew to be part of the Manafort defense team went into the nearby cafe, emerging with a pizza, four sandwiches and four sodas -- just enough, we surmised, for himself and Paul Manafort's three lawyers.At the end of the day, a black Dodge Durango left the Mueller's office loading dock -- half an hour after Mueller left.(The Durango was one of many ordinary, plain vehicles the special counsel's office used to transport witnesses and members of the team.)About a week later, the proffer sessions began in earnest.While the rest of the country was gearing up for the midterms, Manafort and his legal team were visiting the special counsel on a nearly weekly basis, adding up to a total of nine sessions.It was during many of these sessions when, we later learned, Manafort was later accused of lying to prosecutors.Every morning, we were on the lookout for what would come first: a black government car with tinted windows which we figured out was transporting Manafort from jail and into the loading dock, or Manafort's lawyers coming in on foot -- often led by lead defense attorney Kevin Downing ready with a joke.How are negotiations going with the Mueller team?"Just having lunch, tacos around the corner," he said, holding the bag open to see, before moving on.Why they were there following Manafort's agreement to waive having an attorney present as part of his plea deal?He motioned across the plaza: "There's great sandwiches over there."The mystery case Over time, we trained our eyes to recognize not only Mueller from where we sat in the coffee shop but everyone else we knew who worked at the special counsel's office, whether they were walking toward us or away from us, or with a crowd of people.(The government shutdown, which drastically reduced foot traffic in the plaza, helped confirm this as well.)At the same time, any deviation caused consternation in the CNN office.One day in December 2018, Mueller wasn't seen coming in, and an email returned half-jokingly with:"SO MUELLER IS MISSING?!"The unofficial FBI uniform of a bright white dress shirt -- Mueller does not like his team wearing shirts with patterns -- and a dark suit helped to spot people from far away, too.We realized that when a group of people -- prosecutors, FBI agents, DOJ paralegals or administrative personnel -- headed to the garage, we could catch them leaving and send a heads up to our colleagues at US District Court, roughly five minutes away.We could run to the side to the garage, too, to see which tinted car they left in and in which direction they were headed.JUST WATCHED Mystery grand jury in Mueller probe explained Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mystery grand jury in Mueller probe explained 02:10 We reverse-engineered this method as well; if we saw a car drive into the special counsel's office, we could run to the front to see who was coming up from the garage and into the lobby elevators.On December 14, 2018, a hearing at the DC court of appeals about a mysterious grand jury subpoena was to occur.The case, long suspected to be related to Mueller's investigation, was sealed and secretive -- the court had taken great precautions to keep the identity of the defense lawyers and prosecutors anonymous by clearing the entire fifth floor of any journalists.As the press corps teamed up to stake out the courthouse, we knew that members of the special counsel's office drove out in a black DOJ car that day, and they would presumably drive the car back.We waited at the side for the car to return and ran to the front where we observed prosecutors Zainab Ahmad, Dreeben, Andrew Weissmann, Elizabeth Prelogar and one other person emerged from the garage.Our stakeout again paid off helping us fill some gaps in the story we reported later that day From spots to scoops Of course, Manafort wasn't the only high profile witness being ushered quietly into the special counsel's office earlier that year for hours of interviews.In January 2018, we spotted a man with a dark overcoat and brown suitcase exiting Mueller's office, flanked by two people who appeared to be legal assistants.The trio hurried out of the front entrance and got into a dark car, but we were able to snap a quick photo from our post on the sidewalk.We later identified that the older man was a prominent white-collar attorney, Tom Green.This led to CNN's scoop that former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates had quietly added Green to his defense team and that Gates was nearing a plea deal with the special counsel.Gates, not known for grabbing headlines like other witnesses in Mueller's probe, turned into one of Mueller's most significant witnesses, testifying against his former boss Manafort.One night in early February 2018, someone we hadn't seen before exited the building.We later identified the man as veteran pollster and political strategist Tony Fabrizio, which led to CNN's report that he had been interviewed by Mueller's team .Fabrizio had previously worked on Ukrainian elections with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and went on to serve as the Trump campaign's chief pollster.The hunch that helped CNN get Roger Stone's arrest on camera Slight deviations from anyone's routine signaled something important, we came to believe.Prosecutor Aaron Zelinsky, for example, frequently zipped into work on a motorized scooter before walking past us and looking down at his phone.But on one memorable Thursday in January, something was different.Zelinsky walked into work with a small suitcase, a plastic bag and his usual black messenger bag.His charcoal helmet, which he wears while usually scootering or biking into the office, was noticeably absent.We knew Zelinsky was one of the Mueller prosecutors working on matters relating to Roger Stone, Jerome Corsi and WikiLeaks.Corsi's stepson was scheduled to testify that day in front of the grand jury, and we knew there had been speculation for months that Stone could be indicted.JUST WATCHED Video shows FBI at Roger Stone's house Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Video shows FBI at Roger Stone's house 01:16 Roughly half an hour later, we spotted Zelinsky and an FBI agent leaving the special counsel's office in a tinted car we had previously identified as a car used by Mueller's team.Zelinsky and Andrew Goldstein were later spotted at court for what our court reporter believed was a convening of Mueller's grand jury.Was an indictment coming?As it happened, both Sam and Em were at the stakeout that afternoon since one of us (we won't say who) locked the stakeout car key, along with their jacket and bag, in the car.It was a chilly day, so as we waited for help we decamped to the coffee shop to stay warm -- where we then spotted Zelinsky leaving the office in casual clothes with his suitcase and briefcase.He then walked down the street to a nearby hotel, where he hailed a cab.Earlier in the day, we thought that perhaps the suitcase contained materials or documents, but Zelinsky's early departure in casual clothing didn't make sense.Back at the CNN office, reporters covering the investigation put this clue, along with the grand jury session on a Thursday, rather than the usual Friday, together and guessed that Stone may have been indicted.CNN sent a producer and camera to his home in Florida that night, and sure enough, less than 12 hours later, captured the dramatic pre-dawn arrest on video.Zelinsky showed up in the Florida courthouse for the Stone appearance.The end of the investigation By the time Mueller's investigation wrapped up last month, we had plenty of company outside the building.Mueller's ranks of prosecutors, FBI agents and support staff deviated from routine to avoid the gaggle of cameras stationed at the front of the building and other press in general."Oh, here we go again," one passerby scoffed as she walked past the gaggle of cameras and into one of the neighboring buildings.Of course, the gathered reporters knew Mueller was not about to walk out with the report in hand and give a press conference.But the press corps was ready for something to happen.Things had already gotten a bit odd.On one memorable afternoon in February 2019, about a month before the report was submitted, we noticed a commotion in the lobby of Mueller's office building.A few minutes later someone in a bird costume "flew" towards the lobby entrance.Whoever it was then danced, flapped their wings, and "mooned" the press corps assembled outside.They then flapped their arms and "flew" back to the elevators of the steel and glass building..@FossumSamuel's best update from #CNNStakeout today: "Someone in a parrot costume went up to the door.They 'banged' their beak against the glass then showed us their parrot butt...I assume someone inside is making fun of the press out here."pic.twitter.com/8VLk5gMNkM Katelyn Polantz (@kpolantz) February 22, 2019 The day the report was submitted, March 22, it was likely handed to the Justice Department between 11:45 a.m. and 1:10 p.m., during which we saw Mueller's head of security drive out of the building in SCO vehicles with tinted windows.By 4 p.m., every prosecutor we spotted entering the office that morning was gone for the day.Scott Meisler walked out with a backpack and suitcase, turning the tables and stopping briefly to take a photo of the flock of cameras outside.Rush Atkinson, Dreeben, James Quarles, Goldstein, Prelogar, Zebley and Adam Jed had all either driven or walked out of the building.Aaron Zelinsky, the last man standing, left at 3:38 p.m. Where was Mueller?One minute later, the head of the special counsel's security sped out of the garage and drove north in the silver Subaru with no one else inside.The press outside the garage buzzed for the first time all day.About 10 minutes later a woman in a compact car drove out of the special counsel's office building saying, "He's coming, he's coming."Then, the silver Ford expedition drove out of the building.Was Mueller inside?We can't say for sure.But all clues suggest he was, because this car -- a vehicle that CNN's stakeout team has previously seen used to transport witnesses and persons of interest -- was likely used to bring him to work early in the morning.JUST WATCHED 'The witch hunt is over' - or 'I'm f***ed'?Replay More Videos ...

House panel issues subpoena to former White House counsel:::::Washington (CNN) The House Judiciary Committee has served former White House counsel Don McGahn with a subpoena as part of its investigation into obstruction of justice , a move to bring in a key player with direct knowledge about President Donald Trump's efforts to undermine the Russia probe.The Democratic-led panel authorized subpoenas earlier this month for McGahn and four other White House officials as part of its sweeping investigation into possible obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power.But it waited until Monday to issue the subpoena to McGahn, seeking documents and testimony from the former White House counsel.The move is the clearest indication yet that Nadler's committee is plotting an extensive examination into the President's actions outlined in the Mueller report .The committee has already served the Justice Department with a subpoena for the full Mueller report and the underlying evidence , demanding the documents by May 1.Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, accused Nadler of issuing a subpoena prematurely."Don McGahn sat for more than 30 hours of interviews with the special counsel's investigation, and the chairman has answered that with a stunning 36-item subpoena," Collins said in a statement."Instead of looking at material that Attorney General Barr has already made available, Democrats prefer to demand additional materials they know are subject to constitutional and common-law privileges and cannot be produced."An administration official said the White House is aware of the subpoena but declined to comment.McGahn was a central figure in the first two years of the Trump White House and was featured prominently throughout Mueller's report.The special counsel wrote that in June 2017, after media reports indicated Mueller was investigating whether Trump had obstructed justice, Trump called McGahn at home and directed him to call the acting attorney general to say Mueller "had conflicts of interest and must be removed."McGahn declined to do so, deciding that he would "rather resign than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre."It was one of several episodes Mueller outlined in the report where Trump's aides refused to go along with the President's orders to disrupt the Mueller investigation.McGahn was one of numerous former White House officials who spoke to Mueller for his investigation into possible obstruction of justice, which included an examination of 11 separate episodes detailed in the Mueller report.Earlier this month, the House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena to McGahn and four other former White House officials -- former chief strategist Steve Bannon, former chief of staff Reince Priebus, former communications director Hope Hicks and former McGahn deputy Annie Donaldson -- who all were interviewed by Mueller.The other four former White House officials have not yet been issued subpoenas.Nadler said at the subpoena vote that he was interested in documents related to the officials' preparations for their interviews with Mueller."We believe that these individuals may have received documents from the White House in preparation for their interviews with the special counsel," Nadler said at the time."We also believe that these individuals may have turned this information over to their private attorneys.Under applicable federal law, President Trump waived his claims to executive privilege once this information was transmitted to outside counsel."Republicans slammed Democrats for authorizing the subpoenas when the White House officials had expressed a willingness to cooperate with the investigation and in some cases had already provided documents."The chairman is rewarding their cooperation by announcing their subpoenas," Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, said at the committee vote.Collins said that the former officials could not respond to the committee's request since they didn't have custody of the documents in question, because they "all came during their time at the White House, making them presidential records."The five former White House officials were part of a group of 81 individuals and entities who received a request for documents from the committee when it kicked off its investigation in March into potential abuses of power at the White House.The committee requested from McGahn documents related to topics that included former national security adviser Michael Flynn's conversations with the Russian ambassador about sanctions, the President's firing of former FBI Director James Comey, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recusal from the Mueller probe and possible pardons for Flynn, former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump attorney Michael Cohen.The subpoena asked for similar documents as the initial letter sent to McGahn, but there was a notable request added: "Communications with the Executive Office of the President regarding your response to the March 4, 2019 document request by the House Committee on the Judiciary."
Fact check: What Trump associates told the public vs. what they told Mueller:::::Washington (CNN) For two years, President Donald Trump and his close associates contradicted, denied and dodged reports and questions of Russian involvement in the 2016 campaign.Now that the Mueller report is out , redacted as it may be , we have the chance to fact-check those public denials against what many people close to the President actually told Mueller when they were questioned by the special counsel.Here are a few notable examples where the Mueller report contradicts public statements made by Trump and some of his associates.Trump Jr. and the Trump Tower meeting In July 2017, The Washington Post reported that Trump dictated Donald Trump Jr.'s statement over reporting from The New York Times that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer in Trump Tower over the previous summer.What they told the public: Trump didn't dictate his son's statement What they told Mueller: Yes, he did.In a statement to the Post, Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow wrote that "(a)part from being of no consequence, the characterizations are misinformed, inaccurate, and not pertinent."Trump Jr.'s attorney told the Post he had "no evidence to support that theory," saying that writing the statement was "a communal situation that involved communications people and various lawyers."During a briefing , White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the President "certainly didn't dictate, but he like I said, he weighed in, offered suggestion like any father would do."However, as CNN first reported in June 2018, Trump's legal team admitted in a letter to Mueller's team that Trump "dictated" the initial statement from Trump Jr. As the report lays out, top communications aide Hope Hicks told Mueller's team that while she aimed to tell the entire story behind Trump Jr.'s meeting, Trump told her to write a statement saying the discussion during the meeting was about Russian adoptions.Hicks wrote up the statement and ran it by Trump Jr.The statement that emerged was also misleading in the way it characterized the topic of conversation.What they told the public: The meeting was about Russian adoption, not about the 2016 campaign.What they told Mueller: The meeting was promised to be about incriminating information on Hillary Clinton, but turned into a discussion on current sanctions on several Russians.In his statement, Trump Jr. mislead the public by saying they "primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children" that had recently ended, "but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up."Others in the Trump coalition repeated this claim.Mueller's report says that Trump Jr. was enticed to meet with promises of "official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia" for the Trump campaign.The meeting did start with a Kremlin-connected lawyer offering claims that the Democratic National Committee or the Clinton campaign received donations from a questionable source, but it turned into a discussion over the Magnitsky Act, which targets several top Russians with sanctions.As the report mentions, Russia responded to sanctions by preventing adoptions of Russian children to the US.However, the conversation was about the sanctions themselves, not about adoption.Trump Jr. said the topic could be revisited "if and when they were in government."Trump Tower Moscow timeline During the 2016 campaign and into his presidency, reports swirled of Trump's potential business ties to Russia.What they told the public: Trump had no deals or business in Russia.What they told Mueller: The Trump Organization was pursuing a Trump Tower deal in Russia during the campaign, and Trump was aware of it.Trump has repeatedly denied having any business dealings in Russia, suggesting time and again in 2016 that he had no deals or business in the country.According to the Mueller report, "the Trump Organization had been pursuing a licensing deal for a skyscraper to be built in Russia called Trump Tower Moscow."The report notes that not only was Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen pursuing a Moscow deal in Trump's name , but that candidate Trump was receiving updates about the project."Trump told Cohen that Trump Tower Moscow was not a deal yet," the report reads, "and said, 'Why mention it if it is not a deal?'"In his written answers to the special counsel's team, Trump said he had "few" talks with Cohen about the deal, and said he recalled the conversations as being "brief, and they were not memorable."Interfering with the investigation Many reports have come out over the past few years documenting Trump's frustration at the Russia investigation, including his anger toward former Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself, and ultimately his wish that the investigation would be called off.What they told the public: Trump did not want to interfere with the investigation.What they told Mueller: Trump wanted to push Sessions to limit Mueller's jurisdiction.The special counsel's report suggests former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski knew Trump wanted to pressure Sessions to interfere in Mueller's mandate, since Trump, according to the report, asked his former campaign manager in June and July 2017 to pass along a message to Sessions.Around that same time, Lewandowski was defending the President by pointing out that Trump was allowing his attorney general and the special counsel to continue their work unimpeded.At a meeting on June 19, 2017, Trump instructed Lewandowski to dictate a message he wanted his former campaign manager to deliver to Sessions, according to the report."The President directed that Sessions should give a speech publicly announcing: I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas.But our POTUS ... is being treated very unfairly," the special counsel's team wrote in its report."The dictated message went on to state that Sessions would meet with the Special Counsel to limit his jurisdiction to future election interference," the report continued.At a meeting in the Oval Office exactly one month later, on July 19, 2017, Trump asked Lewandowski whether he'd yet met with Sessions to deliver that message."Lewandowski recalled that the President told him that if Sessions did not meet with him, Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired," the report said.But on July 26, 2017 -- just one week later -- Lewandowski defended the President on "Good Morning America" by arguing he had made no attempts to pressure Sessions or Mueller -- even though, as we now know, he privately knew Trump wanted to do both."Donald Trump is letting Jeff Sessions do his job and letting Robert Mueller do his job," Lewandowski said after dismissing questions about whether Trump wanted to interfere with either man as "speculation and conjecture."The previous week, Lewandowski had asked Rick Dearborn, then White House deputy chief of staff, to relay to Sessions the message Trump had asked him to deliver.Sarah Sanders and the FBI It's no secret that Trump did not like former FBI Director James Comey, and in May 2017, Sanders, then a deputy press secretary, claimed that many people in federal law enforcement had "lost confidence" in Comey.What they told the public: The FBI lost confidence in their director James Comey.What they told Mueller: Sanders made this up."There's also another nugget of big news, as you guys may have been paying attention," Sanders told reporters after Comey's firing."The President, over the last several months, lost confidence in Director Comey.The DOJ lost confidence in Director Comey.... And most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director."JUST WATCHED Sarah Sanders made an important admission to Mueller's team Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sarah Sanders made an important admission to Mueller's team 02:35 When asked about FBI agents who disagree, Sanders said, "we've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things."Later, however, Sanders told the special counsel that this claim was a "slip of the tongue" and a fabrication."She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made 'in the heat of the moment' that was not founded on anything," the Mueller report reads.
Mueller report shows Hope Hicks' struggle to persuade 'boss man' Trump:::::West Palm Beach, Florida (CNN) She built a national reputation as the elusive public relations force behind President Donald Trump's campaign and administration, but Hope Hicks couldn't save the President from himself on Air Force One in July of 2017.Though she rarely spoke on the record and almost never appeared before cameras, her candid account under oath of her deliberations with Trump as they sought to spin the story about Donald Trump Jr.'s June 9, 2016, Trump Tower meeting with Russians paints an in-depth portrait of the challenges of working for Trump -- and getting him to heed advice."I think that's right, too, but boss man worried it invites a lot of questions," she said in a text message to Trump Jr. at one point on the flight home from the G20 Summit in Germany, according to special counsel Robert Mueller's redacted report released Thursday The White House repeatedly said the President was not involved with the crafting of his son's statement, which he in fact dictated, but Hicks' testimony to the special counsel's team, which took place in December 2017 and March 2018, offers an in-depth account of her repeated efforts to counsel the President on a communications strategy regarding the existence of emails documenting his son's summer 2016 meeting with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer and Hicks' attempt to convince him to proactively release emails about the meeting.Hicks, whom Trump calls "Hopey," was one of his original campaign staffers before joining him at the White House.She has long been considered one of his most loyal defenders, working almost entirely behind-the-scenes.Her journey to the White House began when she was a PR staffer working with Ivanka Trump's clothing line.After a whirlwind rise to the top communications post at the White House, she announced her resignation in late February 2018, and recently moved to California to begin a new role as executive vice president and chief communications officer at FOX.According to the special counsel's report, the President's personal legal team learned of emails about the June 9, 2016, meeting in June of 2017.Hicks told Mueller's team that she attended a meeting in the White House residence with the President, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, on or about June 22, 2017, to discuss how to best handle the emails."Kushner brought a folder of documents to the meeting and tried to show them to the President, but the President stopped Kushner and said he did not want to know about it, shutting the conversation down," per the report.Hicks read the emails herself on June 28, 2017, the report said, and voiced her concerns with the President on June 29.She told the special counsel's office she was shocked by the emails, saying in her March 2018 testimony they looked "really bad.""The President seemed upset because too many people knew about the emails and he told Hicks that just one lawyer should deal with the matter.The President indicated that he did not think the emails would leak, but said they would leak if everyone had access to them," the report said, noting that Kushner, Hicks, and Ivanka Trump spoke in detail to the President, with Hicks and Josh Raffel -- who served as a White House spokesman for Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner -- encouraging a proactive strategy to release the emails, which the President shot down.JUST WATCHED Trump on Mueller appointment: I'm f***ed Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump on Mueller appointment: I'm f***ed 01:26 Hicks learned The New York Times was working on a story about the meeting, and the President told her not to comment."Hicks thought the President's reaction was odd because he usually considered not responding to the press to be the ultimate sin," the report said.Known for her understanding of Trump's unorthodox communications style and working habits, she differentiated herself amongst aides for her strong relationship with Trump.Hicks and Trump spoke again and she was able to convince him to give the Times a statement.Per the report, during her testimony: "Hicks recalled that the President asked her what the meeting had been about, and she said that she had been told the meeting was about Russian adoption.The President responded, 'then just say that.'" On the flight home from the G20 Summit, Hicks brought Trump a draft of the statement that included the detail in the emails that there was the potential for helpful information to the campaign from the Russians."Hicks again wanted to disclose the entire story, but the President directed that the statement not be issued because it said too much.The President told Hicks to say only that Trump Jr. took a brief meeting and it was about Russian adoption," per the report.Hicks texted Trump Jr. an edited statement and they exchanged texts, according to the report: "Hicks's text concluded, 'Are you ok with this?Attributed to you.'"Trump Jr. responded by text message that he wanted to add the word 'primarily' before 'discussed' so that the statement would read, 'We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children.'Trump Jr. texted that he wanted the change because '[t]hey started with some Hillary thing which was bs and some other nonsense which we shot down fast.'"Hicks texted back, 'I think that's right too but boss man worried it invites a lot of questions[.)[U]ltimately [d]efer to you and [your attorney] on that word Bc I know it's important and I think the mention of a campaign issue adds something to it in case we have to go further.'"Trump Jr. responded, 'lf l don't have it in there it appears as though I'm lying later when they inevitably leaksomething.'JUST WATCHED Tapper on report: Why was Trump initially so worried?Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Tapper on report: Why was Trump initially so worried?01:46 Hicks again talked to the President on the Air Force One flight."Hicks recalled again going to the President to urge him that they should be fully transparent about the June 9 meeting, but he again said no, telling Hicks, 'You've given a statement.We're done,' " the report said.This is the July 8, 2017, statement to the Times, as attributed to Donald Trump Jr.: "It was a short introductory meeting.I asked Jared (Kushner) and Paul (Manafort) to stop by.We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at the time and there was no follow up.I was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand."The Times published its story about the meeting before the flight landed.Ultimately, Hicks' strategy was proven right: reports of the emails came out and Trump Jr. was forced to issue a second statement.The President's son released the second statement on July 9, acknowledging that he was told the Russian had information about Clinton, and ultimately released his email communications with Rob Goldstone about the meeting on July 11, 2017.
13 times that people who worked for Donald Trump directly disobeyed him:::::(CNN) On Monday, President Donald Trump said this about the people who work for him: "Nobody disobeys my orders."Trump was reacting to the release of the Mueller report last week, which provided painstaking details about -- among other things -- Trump's efforts to remove Robert Mueller as special counsel and to steeply curtail the scope of Mueller's investigation.In each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics.Click to subscribe!It was in keeping with his I'm-a-tough-guy-and-no-one-crosses-me-and-gets-away-with-it persona.But it was also in keeping with another common Trump trait: It isn't true."The president's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."Below, a list of just some of the known instances in which Trump's staff disobeyed a direct or indirect order from the President.1.White House counsel Don McGahn refused to fire Mueller 2.Attorney General Jeff Sessions refused to un-recuse himself in the Russia investigation 3.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski refuse d to tell Sessions to tell Mueller to limit the scope of his inquiry to only future election interference 4.FBI Director James Comey didn't see a way to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn 5.Department of Homeland Security boss Kirstjen Nielsen refused to close the southern border 6.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson refused a litany of Trump's requests; "Mr. President I understand what you want to do but you can't do it that way," Tillerson later recounted ."It violates the law."7.Staff secretary Rob Porter refused to reach out to Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand to see if she was sufficiently on Team Trump and, if so, might be interested in overseeing the special counsel investigation 8.McGahn refused to go back on his story that Trump had asked him to remove Mueller -- and refused to write a letter for the White House with such a denial.9.Defense Secretary James Mattis refused Trump's exhortation to back the withdrawal of American troops from Syria.Mattis resigned instead 10.Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel refused Trump's order to bus undocumented immigrants detained at the border to sanctuary cities in Democratic-held congressional districts.11.Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein refused Trump's request to state publicly that his memo was the impetus for Comey's removal 12.White House chief of staff Reince Priebus refused Trump's order to find a way to fire Sessions 13.Deputy national security adviser K.T.McFarland refused to write a memo making clear that Trump had not told Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russians prior to coming into office.This is, of course, not a complete list.Rather, it's more of a highlight reel.But you get the point: Trump's claim about people never disobeying orders is, on its face, not just false, but ridiculous.
Trump administration announces all countries importing Iranian oil will be subject to US sanctions:::::Washington (CNN) The Trump administration announced Monday that all countries that continue to import Iranian oil will be subject to US sanctions.In a statement, the White House said President Donald Trump "has decided not to reissue" waivers regarding sanctions against countries importing Iranian oil when the waivers expire "in early May."The exact deadline is May 2."This decision is intended to bring Iran's oil exports to zero, denying the regime its principal source of revenue," the statement from White House press secretary Sarah Sanders read.Speaking Monday at a press conference, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said "the goal remains simple: to deprive the outlaw regime of the funds it had used to destabilize the Middle East for four decades and incentivize Iran to behave like a normal country."Noting that oil is "the regime's No.1 source of cash," Pompeo said that prior to the implementation of US sanctions, Iran was generating "as much as $50 billion annually," from oil exports, but that the department estimates the sanctions have "denied the regime well north of $10 billion.""How long we remain there -- at zero -- depends solely on the Islamic Republic (of) Iran's senior leaders," he added."We have made our demands very clear to the ayatollah and his cronies: end your pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop testing and proliferating ballistic missiles, stop sponsoring and committing terrorism, halt the arbitrary detention of US citizens.Our pressure is aimed at ending these and others and it will continue to accelerate until Iran is willing to address them at the negotiating table," Pompeo said.Countries that continue to import Iranian oil in large amounts include India, China, South Korea, Japan and Turkey.Ahead of today's announcement South Korean officials told CNN that they had struggled with the US demand because their oil refineries are specifically setup to process crude oil from Iran.Pompeo also said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to "ensure an appropriate supply (of oil) for the markets" in order to make up for the loss of Iranian oil in the global market."I can confirm that each of those suppliers are working directly with Iran's former customers to make the transition away from Iranian crude less disruptive," he said.After the announcement from the US, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said the country will coordinate with other oil producers "to ensure the availability of enough oil supplies for consumers and to ensure global oil markets are not knocked off balance."The US will also aid the dearth in supply, Pompeo said.The US produced 1.6 million more barrels of oil in 2018 than in 2017, and is on track to increase production in 2019 as well.But given the ongoing crises in both Venezuela and Libya, which are two major oil supplying countries, there are fears that the US decision will make the oil market more unstable When asked about the spike in oil process on Monday -- as Brent crude prices surged more than 3% to the highest price seen all year -- and if the US expects that spike to level out, the State Department would not give a direct answer.Francis Fannon, the Assistant Secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Energy Resources, explained that "it is hard to conflate" the Trump administration's announcement with other factors such as OPEC planning to curtail production."There's lots of reasons in terms of what effects oil markets."The announcement comes nearly one year after Trump announced the US was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been the most vocal proponent of Trump's actions against Iran, praised the move Monday."The decision of President Trump and the American administration is of great importance to increase the pressure on the terror regime of Iran," Netanyahu said in a statement."We stand by the determination of the United States against the Iranian aggression and this is the right way to stop it."Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu firmly rejected the Trump administration decision on Monday, saying via Twitter that "the US decision to end sanctions waivers on Iran oil imports will not serve regional peace and stability yet will harm Iranian people.Turkey rejects unilateral sanctions and impositions on how to conduct relations with neighbors."He went further during a press conference in Ankara, saying that "pushing buying oil from countries besides Iran goes too far.Turkey is against those steps and impositions," according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.A senior Iraqi official said Monday that Trump's decision to end waivers for the purchase of Iranian oil exports, and pressure Iraq to end its purchase of Iranian power is a "serious problem.""Iraq needs good relations with Iran.The US has one policy focus, which is to bring Iran down and are looking through this prism.The situation is precarious.The Americans need a nuanced policy.This drive by the White House risks disrupting Iraq.If they really want a policy towards Iran, they should look at strengthening Iraq.But given that much of our assets are in the Federal Reserve the Americans can make life very difficult for us," the official told CNN.Not everyone is in full support of the Trump administration's muscular posture towards Iran and some worry that the administration is trying to incite a revolution to overthrow the Iranian regime.On Monday Pompeo said that the US has "not supported any outside group" -- such as the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, known as the MEK.The Trump administration is supporting the Iranian people, he added.However, last week Pompeo did not issue a firm denial when he was asked if the Trump administration was seeking a military confrontation with Iran, within the contours of the Authorization to Use Military Force legislation.Instead, he left the door slightly ajar."The United States and President Trump will act lawfully.He'll act within his authorities," Pompeo said."Article 2 gives broad powers, the AUMF gives a set of broad powers, but they are -- we understand them."Correction: This article has been corrected to reflect that Pompeo said the sanctions have denied the Iranian regime more than $10 billion.
Giuliani: 'There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians':::::Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani said while he would have advised the Trump campaign to avoid Russian help, he thought there was nothing wrong with a campaign taking information from Russia."There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians," Giuliani said Sunday on CNN's "State of the Union."Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper if he would have taken information from a foreign source, Giuliani said, "I probably wouldn't.""I wasn't asked," Giuliani said."I would have advised, just out of excess of caution, don't do it."Giuliani's comments came in an extended rebuttal to Utah GOP Sen. Mitt Romney, who issued a statement Friday saying he was "sickened" by the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller's recently released report.Read More
From 'total exoneration' to 'total bullsh**': Trump lingers on damning report:::::Washington (CNN) By the time President Donald Trump had passed through the prime rib buffet at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday to sit for dinner with family and a top aide, the damning picture Robert Mueller's report painted of his presidency had become clear.Instead of the "total exoneration" Trump had proclaimed earlier, the report portrayed the President as deceitful and paranoid encouraging his aides to withhold the truth and cross ethical lines in an attempt to thwart a probe into Russia's interference in US elections -- his "Achilles heel," according to one forthcoming adviser.Perhaps more angering to a leader who detests weakness -- but doesn't necessarily mind an amoral reputation -- were the number of underlings shown ignoring his commands , privately scoffing at the "crazy sh**" he was requesting and working around him to avoid self-implication.Now, those close to him say Trump is newly furious at the people -- most of whom no longer work for him -- whose extensive interviews with the special counsel's office created the epic depiction of an unscrupulous and chaotic White House.And he's seeking assurances from those who remain that his orders are being treated like those of a president, and not like suggestions from an intemperate but misguided supervisor."Because I never agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the 'Report' about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad)," Trump tweeted on Friday morning as he waited out a rainstorm in Florida before proceeding to his golf course for a round with conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh.Some current and former officials who accurately predicted that details in the Mueller report would be embarrassing for the White House are now questioning the legal strategy to fully cooperate with the Mueller investigation.One official who sat down with the special counsel noted that they did so at the behest of the former White House legal team, John Dowd and Ty Cobb, who provided a wealth of documents and encouraged senior officials to be interviewed.It was because of these interviews with people closest to the President that Mueller and his team were able to get a cinematic look at the deceit and trickery taking place in the West Wing.While these people are critical, the full cooperation was a strategy to make it hard for Mueller to push for an interview given all the information he was given.It was a strategy that worked, even if there is some political embarrassment.The President was aware ahead of its public release what was contained in the Mueller report.Attorney General Bill Barr told reporters Thursday that both the White House counsel and Trump's personal legal team were given an opportunity to read the redacted version in the previous days.Mounting anger But Trump grew angry as he watched cable news coverage because, sources familiar with the matter said, a theme was emerging that vexed him: a portrait of a dishonest president who is regularly managed, restrained or ignored by his staff.It was a sharp turn away from his earlier statements, which welcomed the report's findings on collusion and falsely claimed total exoneration.Hours before his Mar-a-Lago dinner, Trump insisted to a crowd on the tarmac in Florida the dark days of Mueller's special counsel investigation had ended."Game over, folks," he said over the sounds of a busy airport."Now, it's back to work."It's hard to tell, however, what Trump intends to head back to.Mueller's probe and Trump's constant focus on it have been the backdrop for all but a few months of the presidency, often diminishing whatever policy efforts have been orchestrated by officials or Republican lawmakers.The report depicts a President who for two years has been largely consumed by the Russia investigation, intent on short-circuiting it but repeatedly stymied in his efforts by aides.A senior administration official told CNN's Jake Tapper that dynamic was "nothing surprising.""That the President makes absurd demands of his staff and administration officials -- who are alarmed by them and reluctant to follow them -- is not only unsurprising but has become the norm," the official said.Nevertheless, in the past Trump has resisted the idea that he is being controlled by those around him or that they are responsible for his successes.Sources familiar with how the West Wing operates said attempts to subvert the President's demands have not ceased now that the Mueller investigation is over.There have been instances in recent weeks where aides have slow walked or ignored Trump's directives, hoping he will forget he gave them.What is clear is many of those who avoided carrying out Trump's demands related to Mueller's probe -- often, it seemed, in a bid to protect themselves from criminal wrongdoing -- are no longer employed by the White House.Instead, the aides who now surround the President appear less willing to write him off and more likely to encourage him to follow his gut.Among those who have moved on: the White House counsel who refused Trump's demand to fire Mueller, the chief of staff and senior adviser who anxiously tried to retrieve a resignation letter from the attorney general, the staff secretary who declined Trump's order to gauge the loyalty of a Justice Department official, the attorney general who refused to un-recuse himself and the communications chief who seemed most expert in Trump's whims.Even Steve Bannon, once viewed as the ultimate advocate for following Trump's instincts, is depicted in the report as a constraining force.In one instance, when the President tried to claim Mueller had a conflict of interest because of a membership dispute at a Trump golf club, Bannon wrote it off as "ridiculous and petty."Trump and Bannon parted ways in the summer of 2017 and have not reconciled since.Instead, the most prominent aides who do remain are depicted in the report as the most dishonest.Press secretary Sarah Sanders, who was out the office when the report was released, is shown repeatedly misleading the press , a fact she attempted to downplay in morning television interviews on Friday."(Trump) has never asked me to break the law," she said on CBS."When the President wants to do something and make a decision, he does it.He's not somebody who sit around and ponders.I think you guys have seen that day in and day out.One minute you're running stories saying the staff can't control him and the next minute everyone's saying thank God the staff could control him.You don't get to have it both ways."Increasingly untethered JUST WATCHED Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Giuliani snaps at Cuomo: Stop using the word 'lie' 02:48 Among those who Trump dined with in Florida on Thursday was Mick Mulvaney, the chief of staff who still fills the role in an acting capacity but who, according to officials, has done less than either of his two predecessors to restrain Trump in his hardline instincts.Indeed, since Mulvaney's tenure began at the start of the year, Trump has overseen the longest government shutdown in US history, a dramatic shakeup at the Department of Homeland Security, a sharp turn toward harsher policies on the border, a decision to ask a court to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act and a confusing dictate on North Korea sanctions that still has advisers scratching their heads.People familiar with Mulvaney's style say those outcomes aren't necessarily his doing, but rather the result of a President newly empowered to follow his impulses without the restrictions placed on him by previous aides.Sources say the President has also come to rely on his chief of staff less than he did during the reign of Reince Priebus or John Kelly, when he would often call his top aide nearly a dozen times a day.Mulvaney has told colleagues there are days he barely hears from the President.In his report, Mueller describes both of Mulvaney's predecessors -- Priebus and Kelly -- as working in at least some capacity to contain the damage of Trump's behavior.Priebus is shown making an urgent (and vaguely comic) effort to recover a resignation letter from then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions that Trump had kept, believing it would amount to a "shock collar" on the Justice Department because it was not dated and aides feared Trump could employ it at his leisure.Kelly told Mueller that when Trump wanted to meet with friends who encouraged his impulses, such as former campaign aide Corey Lewandowski, he tried to push them to the private residence "to create distance from the West Wing."Trump soured on Priebus and Kelly long before he summarily terminated each of their tenures.So, too, had Trump grown wary of former White House counsel Don McGahn, who sat for more than 30 hours of testimony with Mueller's team.Trump grew irate again at his former aide late Thursday and into Friday.In the report, Trump is described as having several tense encounters with McGahn during his White House tenure, including episodes when McGahn was prepared to resign rather than carry out Trump's demands.McGahn described Trump asking him to do "crazy sh**," according to Priebus.Trump, meanwhile, deemed McGahn a "lying bastard" whose habit of taking contemporaneous notes raised suspicion.In an anecdote relayed in the report, Trump and McGahn went back-and-forth over the note-taking, which Trump insisted good lawyers -- such as his onetime counsel Roy Cohn -- never did.Trump hadn't backed off that view by Friday morning, when he made clear on Twitter his frustrations at the report."Watch out for people that take so-called 'notes,' when the notes never existed until needed," the President wrote.
House Judiciary Committee issues subpoena to former White House counsel Don McGahn:::::White House counsel Don McGahn to depart in the fall 10:57 AM ET Wed, 29 Aug 2018 | 00:40 The subpoena calls for McGahn to provide documents to the committee by May 7, and to testify May 21.The documents requested cover a wide range of topics, including those related to the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer, potential pardons for Trump associates and Mueller's alleged conflicts of interest.The demand for documents and testimony drew backlash from the committee's Republicans."For the second time in four days, the chairman has issued a subpoena prematurely and contrary to his pledge not 'to issue a subpoena every time we have a disagreement with the administration.'"Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the committee, said in a statement."Don McGahn sat for more than 30 hours of interviews with the special counsel's investigation, and the chairman has answered that with a stunning 36-item subpoena," the Georgia Republican said."Instead of looking at material that Attorney General Barr has already made available, Democrats prefer to demand additional materials they know are subject to constitutional and common-law privileges and cannot be produced."The subpoena comes as pressure mounts on Democrats to make a decision on impeachment."Some of this would be impeachable," Nadler said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," referring to the findings of Mueller's investigation."Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable."
South Bend poor say Democrat Pete Buttigieg left them behind:::::SOUTH BEND, Ind.C.J.Neely, a black 16-year-old who has lived here all his life, thinks it's pretty cool that Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of this small city of about 100,000 people, is running for president."I never heard about anybody from Indiana running for president," Neely said recently outside his childhood home in the city's northwest.Just a few days before, Buttigieg, a rising star of the Democratic Party, officially launched his bid for president at an abandoned Studebaker plant downtown that the city helped convert into a 800,000-square-foot tech hub, a symbol of the city pushing beyond its 20th century roots.Neely, who lives just a few miles away, hadn't heard about the announcement.And, he said, he hasn't seen the progress."This s--- looks the same, every time I walk through here," Neely assessed somberly.Though he acknowledged that the mayor was "trying," the teenager delivered a blunt conclusion: "He's improved s---."At a time when economic inequality and racial justice are at the nation's political forefront, Buttigieg's candidacy could be hamstrung by the impression that he has not tried hard enough to improve the conditions of South Bend's poor and minority communities.Even as his national polling numbers rise, the mayor faces criticism about his record on race, including for his handling of a police controversy that continues to be a subject of conversation in the city.His presidential campaign, however, cited South Bend polling data that shows the mayor has made inroads with minority communities.Chris Meagher, Buttigieg's national press secretary, said in a statement that a poll conducted by Buttigieg's "Pete for South Bend" campaign last month showed 86% "of folks, with a heavy African-American sample, said that the city was on the right track."Indeed, Buttigieg was reelected in 2015 with 80% of the vote, winning every part of South Bend against his Republican competitor.Buttigieg also won 77% of the vote against a black Democratic primary challenger.In that primary race, though, the extent of his victory was uneven, picking up one predominantly black district by only 60 votes, or four percentage points, according to the South Bend Tribune.The skepticism has dogged him on the campaign trail, too.Buttigieg has struggled to attract diverse audiences at rallies so far in his campaign.It is an issue Buttigieg has said he is "very intent" on fixing.His performance among poor and minority voters has weighed on him in some early national polls, too, particularly as his economic record in South Bend comes into greater focus.Buttigieg's campaign declined on multiple occasions to make him available for an interview.
RNC hires little-known intel firm Outliers Group for opposition research on Dems:::::The Republican National Committee has hired a tiny, unknown company, which is run by an Army veteran who leads a private intelligence firm, to dig up opposition research on Democrats for the 2020 campaign.The company, called the Outliers Group, received $10,000 from the RNC in March for research and consulting services, according to the RNC's latest Federal Election Commission filing.It marks the first time Outliers has been paid by any political entity since its founding, FEC records show.Outliers is run by Rob Berra, a former U.S. Army infantry officer and managing director of Clerestory Research, which also isn't known as a go-to firm for the GOP."This was for Democrat oppo research services.Searching for and analyzing public records," Mike Reed, the RNC's deputy chief of staff of communications, told CNBC in an email describing Outliers' role."We partner with a variety of firms to assist us with this type of work as we are doing research on dozens of Democrat candidates in preparation for 2020."Outliers is such an unknown entity that leaders of President Donald Trump's campaign hadn't heard of it."Not heard of either" Outliers or Clerestory, a senior Trump campaign advisor told CNBC.
Expected Social Security shortfall won't stand in way of expansion:::::For example, if lawmakers were to make no changes until 2035, maintaining a 75-year solvency would require a permanent 3.65 percentage-point increase to the payroll tax rate (for a total of 16.05% that gets split between worker and employer) or a 23% reduction to all benefits starting that year.Meanwhile, more than 200 lawmakers, all Democrats, have signed onto the Social Security 2100 Act in the House.Introduced by Rep. John Larson, D-Connecticut, the bill would gradually increase the payroll contribution by workers and their employers to 7.4% each by 2043 from the current 6.2% (to 14.8% altogether from 12.4%).It also would require that earnings above $400,000 be subject to the payroll tax.Right now, earnings above a certain level $132,900 for 2019 are not subject to Social Security taxation.More from Personal Finance: How to turn your side hustle into a legit business Homeowner avoided 'energy guzzlers' and it's paying off Brokers sanctioned in fallout from $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme Among other changes, the yearly cost-of-living adjustment for benefits would rely on a different formula to more accurately reflects rising costs for older Americans.The end result would be extended solvency for the program for 75 years, according to Social Security's Office of the Chief Actuary.Altman also said that despite the impending funding woes, retirees should not worry that their benefits will be reduced or eliminated.In fact, she said, they should feel confident about the program."The whole reason Social Security is projected out for 75 years is to give people a sense of security," Altman said."Social Security has never missed a payment and I don't believe it ever will."
Democrat Seth Moulton running for president: Pushes green jobs, public option:::::Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, who announced a 2020 presidential bid Monday, will likely use his military experience to differentiate himself on national security and defense issues as he faces a competitive Democratic field.But the Harvard-educated Marine veteran will also emphasize his proposals for creating jobs, protecting the environment and improving health care during his long-shot run to take on President Donald Trump in 2020.Moulton, 40, was elected to Congress in 2014.After November's midterm elections, he received national attention for leading a failed effort to deny Nancy Pelosi the House speaker's gavel.Though considered a more moderate candidate, several of Moulton's stances are clearly left of center.Here is a brief look at his policy priorities:
Social Security is headed for insolvency by 2035, government says:::::The financial condition of the government's bedrock retirement programs for middle- and working-class Americans remains shaky, with Medicare pointed toward insolvency by 2026.That's the word from the latest report by the government's overseers of Medicare and Social Security.It paints a sobering picture of the programs, though it's relatively unchanged from last year's update.Social Security would become insolvent in 2035, one year later than previously estimated.Both programs will need to eventually be addressed to avert automatic cuts should their trust funds run dry.Neither President Donald Trump nor Capitol Hill's warring factions has put political perilous cost curbs on their to-do list.The report is the latest update of the government's troubled fiscal picture.It lands in a capital that has proven chronically unable to address it.
Trump says after Mueller report 'you can't impeach,' Democrats committed crimes:::::Trump: Can't impeach somebody who's doing a good job 3:05 PM ET Fri, 4 Jan 2019 | 02:04 The investigation found insufficient evidence to bring an obstruction of justice charge against the president, Mueller wrote, but uncovered several instances in which the president sought to end the probe.Mueller found that those attempts were unsuccessful largely because Trump's subordinates failed to carry out his orders.Though Mueller did not reach a conclusion on obstruction, the report cited a longstanding Justice Department rule that bans bringing charges against a sitting president, leading some legal experts to conclude the special counsel left the determination to Congress.Before the report's release, Trump appointee Attorney General William Barr cleared the president of obstruction charges.And the president's attorneys have said the report shows Trump is innocent.But after viewing the 448-page report, some Democrats revived impeachment talk, including Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee in which impeachment proceedings would begin."Some of this would be impeachable," Nadler said Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press."Nadler said it would be necessary to have both Barr and Mueller come before the Judiciary Committee."Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable," Nadler said.
Trump advisor Hassett expects economy to defy earlier doomsday predictions with 3% growth:::::Stronger economic data recently signals a continuation of the 3% GDP growth rate, Kevin Hassett, an economic advisor to President Donald Trump, said Monday on CNBC."The first quarter is usually a little bit low.I think there's almost more upside than downside risk going forward on the economy," said Hassett, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers."Our internal numbers at CEA got up to around 3% for the first quarter last week with some of the good news on retail sales."The Trump White House has used 3% growth as a yardstick for success of the president's economic agenda, which included tax cuts and business deregulation.The economy nudged past that number when measured from the fourth quarter of 2017 through Q4 of 2018.Last week, economists surveyed by CNBC/Moody's Analytics Rapid Update raised their first-quarter growth estimates by 0.3 percentage point to a median 2.4%, following a sharp increase in March retail sales.Their median forecast for Q1 was as low as 1% earlier in the quarter after the longest government shutdown ever.Sentiment was also muted coming into 2019 after stocks suffered their worst year in about a decade.However, with the S&P 500 up more than 15% in 2019 and the three-week shutdown resolved before February, first-quarter economic numbers were showing more promise than originally thought.The Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow tracker, which tends to be among the rosiest forecasts, estimates growth for Q1 at 2.8%.J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs, which both recently boosted their GDP estimates, see Q1 growth of 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively."It's an uncertain science.There's probably about a 0.5% margin for error.And we're just a smidgen under 3 right now," Hassett said in a "Squawk Box" interview."That's a very different signal than people were expecting in early January."In crowing about 3% growth and blasting what it calls stagnation during former President Barack Obama's tenure, the Trump administration cites the 3.1% advance from fourth quarter 2017 to fourth quarter 2018.But Obama also saw 3% growth on a four-quarter basis on four different occasions.For calendar 2018, growth was 2.9%, matching the Obama-era peak in 2015.
Supreme Court takes up cases that could settle whether LGBT workers are protected by law:::::The Supreme Court on Monday took up job discrimination cases that could for the first time resolve at a national level whether lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers can be fired based on their identity.The cases come as federal courts as well as independent agencies within the Trump administration remain divided over whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which says that employers may not discriminate based on "sex," prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.There is no national law that explicitly bars discrimination on those grounds.State and local laws barring such discrimination do exist.About half of the country's LGBT population lives in states that allow employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, according to MAP, an LGBT advocacy think tank."The impact of this decision will have very real consequences for millions of LGBTQ people across the country," Sarah Warbelow, the legal director for the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, said in a statement.
Trump sues to block subpoena from House Democrats seeking information on his finances:::::Last week, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee subpoenaed Mazars, an accounting firm that Trump had used to prepare several years of financial statements, according to the lawmakers' document.The subpoena requested a slew of financial documents and related materials from Trump, his trust, the Trump Organization, the Trump Corporation, Trump's holdings company, the Trump Foundation and the Trump International Hotel in Washington.Mazars told the committee that it would not be able to comply with demands for those documents without a subpoena, according to Cummings.In a statement, Cummings said that Trump has a "long history of trying to use baseless lawsuits to attack his adversaries, but there is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress."Cummings added: "This complaint reads more like political talking points than a reasoned legal brief, and it contains a litany of inaccurate information.The White House is engaged in unprecedented stonewalling on all fronts, and they have refused to produce a single document or witness to the Oversight Committee during this entire year."Mazars and Peter Kenny, the Oversight Committee's chief investigative counsel, are also listed as defendants in the lawsuit.Trump's lawyer in the lawsuit, William Consovoy, said in a statement that the attempt by Cummings' committee to "obtain years' worth of confidential information from their accountants lacks any legitimate legislative purpose, is an abuse of power, and is just another example of overreach by the president's political opponents."The president's counsel, Jay Sekulow, told NBC News: "We will not allow Congressional Presidential harassment to go unanswered."
Elizabeth Warren wants to use her wealth tax to wipe out Americans' college debt and pay for tuition:::::Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has identified something else to finance with her proposed wealth tax: wiping out student debt and tuition at public colleges.The Massachusetts senator, who has raced ahead of her 2020 rivals with detailed plans to rearrange America's economic priorities, unveiled on Monday her proposal for easing access to higher education.It would: Spend $1.25 trillion over 10 years to eliminate up to $50,000 in student debt for those with household incomes under $100,000 Allow states to make public colleges tuition-free Spend $100 billion on expanded Pell grants to defray more nontuition expenses The money would come from the 2% annual tax she proposes to levy on accumulations of wealth exceeding $50 million, with an additional 1% on wealth exceeding $1 billion.Warren justified the link by asserting that higher education financing has long been crimped by tax cuts for wealthy Americans and corporations."It's time to end that experiment, to clean up the mess it's caused and to do better," Warren wrote in a Medium post."We can make big structural change and create new opportunities for all Americans."Warren's plan would scale back relief for people with incomes above $100,000 and would end entirely at the $250,000 level.She said her proposal would benefit 95% of the 45 million Americans carrying student debt and wipe it out for 75% of them.Those steps, she argued, that would stimulate the economy by improving credit scores, increasing homebuying and easing small-business formation.At the same time, it would cut off federal money from for-profit colleges, which she says "enrich themselves while targeting lower-income students, service members and students of color and leaving them saddled with debt."Warren's wealth tax would raise an estimated $2.7 trillion over 10 years.She has previously proposed using roughly $700 billion of that money to provide universal child care and early childhood education.In theory, that would leave nearly $1 trillion more for Warren to spend.
Trump aims to drive Iran's oil exports to zero by ending sanctions waivers:::::Saudi Arabia and UAE have assured the U.S. they will ensure the market has an "appropriate supply," Pompeo said.He said the suppliers have been working directly with Iran's customers to make the transition away from Iranian barrels less disruptive.The Saudis stopped short of explicitly guaranteeing a change in policy but reiterated its commitment to balancing oil supply and demand.The kingdom will "coordinate with fellow oil producers to ensure adequate supplies are available to consumers while ensuring the global oil market does not go out of balance," Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Monday."In the next few weeks, the Kingdom will be consulting closely with other producing countries and key oil consuming nations to ensure a well-balanced and stable oil market, for the benefits of producers and consumers as well as the stability of the world economy," Falih said in a statement.Following Washington's official announcement, Trump tweeted that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members will "more than make up" for any drop in Iranian supplies.Three of the countries that received the exemptions Greece, Italy and Taiwan have already cut their imports from Iran to zero.However, analysts widely expected the Trump administration to extend the waivers to China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey, all of which took advantage of the waivers during the first six-month window that began in November.Companies in those countries now face the threat of being locked out of the U.S. financial system if they continue to import crude from Iran.The question is whether some of those countries will seek to skirt the sanctions, including by facilitating or encouraging purchases of Iranian crude through companies not tied to the U.S. financial system.China's Foreign Ministry on Monday denounced Washington's Iran policy."China opposes the unilateral sanctions and so-called 'long-arm jurisdictions' imposed by the US.Our cooperation with Iran is open, transparent, lawful and legitimate, thus it should be respected," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang told reporters."Our government is committed to upholding the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and will play a positive and constructive role in upholding the stability of global energy market."Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlut Cavusoglu also rejected the sanctions, saying they "will not serve regional peace and stability" and would hurt the Iranian people.Dialing up pressure on Iran threatens to spark maritime conflict in the Persian Gulf.Iran has long threatened to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, the world's busiest transit lane for seaborne oil shipments, if it is prevented from exporting oil.On Monday, Iranian officials renewed those threats."According to international law, the Strait of Hormuz is a marine passageway and if we are barred from using it, we will shut it down.In case of any threat, we will have not even an iota of doubt to protect and defend the Iranian waters," Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri, commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps' Navy, told the al-Alam news channel, according to Iran's semi-official Fars news agency.Earlier this month, the Trump administration designated Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization, marking the first time the U.S. has applied the designation to a foreign country's military.
Ukraine enters uncharted new era after comedian wins presidency:::::Ukraine entered uncharted political waters on Monday after near final results showed a comedian with no political experience and few detailed policies had dramatically up-ended the status quo and won the country's presidential election by a landslide.The emphatic victory of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, 41, is a bitter blow for incumbent Petro Poroshenko who tried to rally Ukrainians around the flag by casting himself as a bulwark against Russian aggression and a champion of Ukrainian identity.With over 90 percent of the vote counted, Zelenskiy had won 73 percent of the vote with Poroshenko winning just under 25 percent.Zelenskiy, who plays a fictitious president in a popular TV series, is now poised to take over the leadership of a country on the frontline of the West's standoff with Russia following Moscow's annexation of Crimea and support for a pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine.Declaring victory at his campaign headquarters to emotional supporters on Sunday night, Zelenskiy promised he would not let the Ukrainian people down."I'm not yet officially the president, but as a citizen of Ukraine, I can say to all countries in the post-Soviet Union look at us.Anything is possible!"Zelenskiy, whose victory fits a pattern of anti-establishment figures unseating incumbents in Europe and further afield, has promised to end the war in the eastern Donbass region and to root out corruption amid widespread dismay over rising prices and sliding living standards.But he has been coy about exactly how he plans to achieve all that and investors want reassurances that he will accelerate reforms needed to attract foreign investment and keep the country in an International Monetary Fund program."Since there is complete uncertainty about the economic policy of the person who will become president, we simply don't know what is going to happen and that worries the financial community," said Serhiy Fursa, an investment banker at Dragon Capital in Kiev."We need to see what the first decisions are, the first appointments.We probably won't understand how big these risks are earlier than June.Perhaps nothing will change."
Top Senate races in 2020 election include Alabama, Arizona, Colorado:::::President Donald Trump's fight to hold the White House will captivate America next year.But don't forget about the Senate Republicans the president relies on to push his nominees and policy goals through Congress.The GOP holds a 53-47 majority in the chamber.The party's Senate control is critical for Trump, as it cushions him against the movements of the Democratic-held House.The landscape may shift in a hurry during the November 2020 elections.Not only could Trump's bid for a second term fail, but also both chambers of Congress may change hands.Republicans will have to scrap to keep their Senate majority: the party has to defend 22 seats next year, while only 12 Democratic-held seats are up for grabs.To take control of the Senate, Democrats would need to defeat GOP incumbents in some combination of states such as Colorado and Arizona which have trended more blue in recent elections and more reliably red states including Georgia and Texas.Democrats including perhaps the most vulnerable senator up for reelection in 2020, Doug Jones of Alabama will also have to defend their own seats.Here are the most important Senate races of 2020 and where they stand now in their early stages:
Rudy Giuliani on Mueller report: 'There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians':::::Rudy Giuliani said on Sunday that there's 'nothing wrong' with taking information from Russians, after the Mueller report laid out extensive ties between the Trump campaign and Russians during the 2016 election campaign.The president's lawyer told CNN's Jake Tapper, "any candidate in the world would take information," even as Tapper noted the information came from a "hostile foreign source."The comments came as Giuliani slammed a statement made by Sen. Mitt Romney criticizing Trump after a redacted version of the 448-page Mueller report was released on Thursday.The report found that Russia interfered with the 2016 presidential election but it could not conclude that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia.On obstruction it did not find the president guilty, but it also did not "exonerate" him.Romney's statement read in part: "I am also appalled that, among other things, fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia including information that had been illegally obtained; that none of them acted to inform American law enforcement; and that the campaign chairman was actively promoting Russian interests in Ukraine."The statement referred to the infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting where Trump campaign officials including Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort agreed to sit down with Russians offering dirt on their Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.Giuliani called Romney a hypocrite."Stop the bull.Stop this pious act that you weren't trying to dig up dirt on people," Giuliani said of Romney, who ran for president in 2012 against Barack Obama.Giuliani noted that he had run in the Republican primary against Romney.He added, "Who says it's even illegal" to get opposition research from foreigners, though he said he would have advised against it and "probably" would not have done it himself.The Romney statement didn't sit well with the president either.He pinned a tweet mocking the Utah senator to his own Twitter feed."If @MittRomney spent the same energy fighting Barack Obama as he does fighting Donald Trump, he could have won the race (maybe)!"it said.
House Judiciary Chairman Nadler says obstruction evidence against Trump 'impeachable' if proven:::::House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said Sunday that evidence of obstruction by President Donald Trump laid out in the Mueller report would be impeachable if proven."If proven, some of this would be impeachable, yes," Nadler said on Meet the Press."Obstruction of justice if proven would be impeachable."However, Nadler said House Democrats have not opened an impeachment inquiry.The judiciary chairman's comments come on the heels of the release of a redacted version of Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether or not the Trump campaign conspired with the Kremlin.Mueller documented extensive ties between Russians and Trump campaign officials, but concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to establish a conspiracy.On obstruction, Mueller pointedly declined to exonerate Trump, laying out several instances in which the president sought to curtail the Russia investigation.Several leading Democrats have called for impeachment proceedings against the president in the wake of the Mueller report.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate, on Friday called on Congress to begin the process of removing Trump from office through impeachment proceedings.But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , prior to the release of the Mueller report, had stated that she opposes impeachment due to Republican control of the Senate and over concerns that it would only further divide the country.
Most 2020 Democratic presidential candidates agree on recreational marijuana: Legalize it:::::There's one topic almost every 2020 Democratic presidential candidate agrees on: removing marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances.Nearly every candidate has offered support for the federal legalization of recreational marijuana and many have called to expunge federal charges for those prosecuted for pot use.Ten states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana use and more states have signaled interest in doing so.Public opinion has shifted in favor of legalization, with 61% of Americans believing marijuana should be legal.Democrats support it even more, with 76% favoring legal marijuana, according to a 2018 poll of 2,348 American adults.Critics of recreational marijuana fear it would make the drug too accessible and could promote misuse, but supporters cite increased tax revenues and racial imbalances in criminal sentences for drug offenders as reasons for legalization.Here is what the Democratic presidential candidates have said and done about legalization:
Cenk Uygur on why Democrats are afraid of Bernie Sanders:::::Sen. Bernie Sanders is making mainstream Democrats nervous.But some of the presidential candidate's supporters say it's not because they're worried Sanders can't defeat President Donald Trump in 2020.It's because he can, they say.The Vermont democratic socialist may have surprised the party's establishment with his strong performance so far.He's been polling second, behind only former Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to enter the race.Sanders also took the lead in an Emerson poll released Tuesday.He raised more than $18 million in the first quarter of 2019, the most money of any Democratic contender.And his base of loyal followers, who made him a force in the 2016 primary, has not gone anywhere."Bernie right now has a better chance of winning than the rest of field combined," said Cenk Uygur, founder of progressive news network TYT and host of "The Young Turks," who supported Sanders in 2016.Uygur has not decided whom he will back in 2020, but says he likes Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.Uygur said the establishment's concerns about Sanders raised in a New York Times article on Tuesday, will only make Sanders stronger.The article quotes party insiders who fear that Sanders' campaign will complicate efforts to defeat Trump.Their goal is to stop him from gaining more ground and certainly to thwart his chances of becoming the Democratic 2020 nominee.David Brock, a political consultant, told the Times: "There's a growing realization that Sanders could end up winning this thing, or certainly that he stays in so long that he damages the actual winner."Brock told the paper that he has had discussions with other operatives about an anti-Sanders campaign and believes it should commence "sooner rather than later."The Sanders campaign was not available for comment.The Democratic National Committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Already, a fight has erupted between Sanders and the Center for American Progress, a think tank that has ties to Hillary Clinton.But Uygur sees another reason for the establishment's concerns about Sanders: "The big Dem donors are not worried he's going to lose the general election, they're worried he's going to win," he tweeted on Tuesday.Uygur's point is that big money donors who back mainstream candidates will lose their positions of power in the face of a Sanders win.A political system corrupted by corporate cash and influence, he said, will finally fall if the democratic socialist who has proposed "Medicare for All," free college education and a $15 minimum wage is elected."The people with the most money will lose all power, they will not be rewarded," he said."All their power is in giving money to politicians and controlling them.Bernie Sanders doesn't want their money.They are going to fight Bernie Sanders harder than any Republican will."That could be a dangerous game: Attacking Sanders will "force everyone to rally around him," Uygur said."That's why Bernie has always stood an excellent chance of winning.They can't take away a small donor base.The more they attack him, the more he will raise."Indeed, the Sanders' campaign is already fundraising on the party conflict, dashing off a pitch this week that read in part: "The Democratic establishment and high-dollar donors are already planning how to stop our campaign.They are terrified of our movement - as they should be."Ryan Grim, Washington bureau chief for progressive news site The Intercept, a former contributor to MSNBC and a contributor to the Young Turks Network also believes that establishment Democrats are afraid a Sanders win could upend the entire system they operate within."They couch that fear in claims that they're worried he'll lose," he told CNBC."Change is scary."Margo Baldwin, president of Vermont-based Chelsea Green Publishing, called the Democratic establishment "part of the power elite in bed with the banks and the moneyed interests."The company published "Rules for Revolutionaries" by former Sanders' campaign staffers Becky Bond and Zack Exley, as well as "Essential Bernie Sanders and his Vision for America" by Jonathan Tasini."They don't like Trump, but they don't want to see real change," Baldwin added.She joked that the party doesn't seem to like winning either, adding that they "can trot out Biden and they will lose."But Markos Moulitsas, founder and publisher of liberal blog Daily Kos said it's not fear, "it's frustration" that party insiders are feeling.He said in an email that Sanders is "a divisive person" who "roils the party.""As for the big donors, the best way to fight them is to build a small dollar machine that will power candidates at all levels of office," Moulitsas said.He added, "But even if we succeed in building an entire party of small dollar donors, weep not for big corporate money.They'll always have Republicans to buy."It's certainly too early to tell where the race will end up, but for Sanders' supporters, a replay of the infighting that happened in 2016 will not go over well."There will be no end to the fury," Uygur said.
Trump's NAFTA changes would lead to modest boost in growth and jobs, report says:::::The report comes as President Donald Trump pushes Congress to ratify the revised trade deal despite reservations from both Democrats and Republicans.The president has spent his time in office trying to rework trade relationships with major partners, saying changes such as the ones made to NAFTA will encourage American manufacturing and job creation in the U.S.While the ITC study shows the deal would have positive benefits for jobs and economic growth, it underscores that the deal is hardly the "largest" trade agreement ever as Trump has boasted.Even some Republicans in Congress have called the USMCA more of a tweak to NAFTA than a major overhaul."The miniscule projected gains in this long-awaited official government assessment of the revised NAFTA contradict Donald Trump's grandiose claims that it will lead to 'cash and jobs pouring into the U.S.' and reinforces congressional Democrats' views that absent more improvements, the revised deal won't stop NAFTA's ongoing damage," Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, said in a statement to CNBC.A separate report from the U.S. Trade Representative, part of the executive branch, projected the deal would have bigger effects on the auto industry specifically.While the ITC estimated 28,000 job gains in the auto sector, the USTR thinks the trade deal would create 76,000 auto jobs in the next five years, a roughly 7.5 percent increase for the industry.Some industries cheered the ITC report both the National Association of Manufacturers and the Computer & Communications Industry Association encouraged Congress to approve USMCA following its release.Democrats who hold the House and the power to slow ratification of the deal have raised concerns about labor and environmental provisions contained in the deal.Some GOP lawmakers have also pushed Trump to drop tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada and Mexico before moving forward with the agreement.The deal would not come without its downsides for consumers.Under the provisions of the agreement, auto costs would rise and sales would fall, the ITC estimated.CNBC's Mary Catherine Wellons contributed to this report Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Trump barely disrupted Russia investigation, Mueller report says:::::President Donald Trump barely influenced the Russia investigation, according to special counsel Robert Mueller's team.But it's largely because the people he ordered to disrupt the probe into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election did not carry out his orders, according to a redacted report released Thursday.Mueller's team outlined several key events it investigated relating to questions of whether Trump obstructed justice.Those include him asking former FBI Director James Comey to stop investigating former national security advisor Michael Flynn and ordering former White House counsel Don McGahn to remove Mueller, among other instances."The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests," the report reads.Comey and McGahn did not carry out the president's requests which McGahn referred to as "crazy s---," according to Mueller's report.The former White House counsel prepared to resign instead of following through on what the president wanted.Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House aide Rick Dearborn also did not carry out the president's requests.Trump asked them to deliver a message to former Attorney General Jeff Sessions saying he should try to limit the Mueller probe to only future election meddling.Lewandowski was not a member of the administration.Ultimately, Mueller's team did not conclude whether the president obstructed justice by trying to influence the probe.It in part cited difficulties in determining the president's intent behind his actions.Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein declined to charge Trump with obstruction, a move met with skepticism from congressional Democrats.Trump responded to the release of the report by saying "No collusion, no obstruction," at a White House event Thursday.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.
Trump allies dismiss Mueller report's damaging details and claim 'total vindication':::::Yet even as they held up the report by special counsel Robert Mueller as proof of their client's innocence, Trump's lawyers also sought to undermine the veracity of the report itself, and the scores of damaging revelations contained within it.The report included vivid details of more than a dozen instances during which the president appears to have sought to interfere in the special counsel's Russia probe."The report itself is nothing more than an attempt to rehash old allegations" wrote Trump's lawyers.The attorneys also suggested that the report might violate rules that prohibit the Justice Department from "insinuating or alleging that an individual who has not been charged with a crime is nevertheless guilty of some wrongdoing."While Trump himself made only a passing reference to the report on Thursday morning, Vice President Mike Pence issued a statement that essentially served as the White House's formal response."The report confirms what the President and I have said since day one: there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and there was no obstruction of justice," the statement said.Even as he struck a note of confidence, Pence also tacitly acknowledged that the report's release would do little to put to rest the serious questions raised about the propriety of the president's actions during his first two years in office.According to Pence, however, these questions amount to little more than partisan political weapons."While many Democrats will cling to discredited allegations," Pence said, "the American people can be confident President Trump and I will continue to focus" on improving the country.For those in Trump's political firmament, however, the damaging revelations in the Mueller report appeared not to exist at all."President Trump has been fully and completely exonerated yet again," Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, said in a statement."Now that the collusion and obstruction conspiracy theories have been exposed for the pathetic hoaxes they always were," the statement continued, "the Obama-era DOJ and FBI must answer for their misdeeds and the scam that they perpetrated against the American people."Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel called the report "a complete and total vindication of President Trump.""It is increasingly clear that the only scandal here is the Obama administration's repeated failure to act against Russian cyber meddling," she added."Instead, they prioritized spying on a political opponent the Trump campaign and used a phony DNC-funded dossier as justification."Both McDaniels' and the Trump campaign's statements sought to dismiss the contents of the report and focus on the unfounded allegation that Trump's 2016 presidential campaign had been placed under improper surveillance due to its myriad contacts with people suspected of connections to Russian intelligence.Yet as the amount of damaging information about the president's actions grew larger and more public Thursday, it was unclear how long Trump's political operation would be able to go on focusing exclusively on Attorney General Bill Barr's conclusions while ignoring the report's contents.WATCH: Pimco's Libby Cantrill: The Mueller report will slow lawmaking in Congress
HBO wants Trump to stop making 'Game of Thrones'-style tweets:::::In a more than 400-page report, Mueller's team said it did not find evidence that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin.Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein further determined that Mueller's findings did not warrant an obstruction of justice offense.As part of his victory lap Thursday morning, Trump tweeted an image using a font style that closely matches the title cards and credits used in HBO's show."NO COLLUSION.NO OBSTRUCTION," the text of the image reads."FOR THE HATERS AND THE RADICAL LEFT DEMOCRATS GAME OVER."HBO, a unit of AT&T, said in a statement that it doesn't want Trump using the show, which clocked a record-high 17.4 million viewers during its season premiere, to suit his political agenda."Though we can understand the enthusiasm for Game of Thrones now that the final season has arrived, we still prefer our intellectual property not be used for political purposes," an HBO spokesman said in a statement to CNBC.Trump has aped the style and slogans of "Game of Thrones" before.He has shared at least two other photos in the past six months that borrow from the slogans and font style of the television series.In November, Trump promoted his administration's promised sanctions against Iran by tweeting "SANCTIONS ARE COMING NOVEMBER 5" a clear reference to the phrase "Winter is coming" popularized by the show."We were not aware of this messaging and would prefer our trademark not be misappropriated for political purposes," HBO told CNBC at the time.The network's official Twitter account later suggested Trump misused its trademark.In January, Trump's Instagram account posted a similar photo this one apparently meant to promote Trump's long-held campaign promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding HBO's statement.WATCH: What it costs to eat like The Mountain will shock you
Read the redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Trump-Russia probe:::::A redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report was released to the public Thursday.The document, which lays out the findings of Mueller's 22-month investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election, is 448 pages long and consists of three volumes: a section on Russian interference, a section on obstruction of justice and an appendix.Members of Congress have called for special council Robert Mueller to testify before the House and Senate by May 23.Here are some of the report's key findings.Read the report below
Donald Trump on Mueller's appointment: 'This is the end of my presidency. I'm f----d':::::When former Attorney General Jeff Sessions told President Donald Trump that a special counsel had been appointed to conduct the Russia investigation, the president responded: "Oh my God.This is terrible.This is the end of my presidency.I'm fucked."That's according to the redacted version of the report by Robert Mueller, who investigated Russian election interference, ties to the Trump campaign and possible presidential obstruction of justice.The report cites notes from Sessions' chief of staff, Jody Hunt.The president had become angry at the attorney general for his decision to recuse from the investigation, asking "How could you let this happen, Jeff?"the report says.Trump told Sessions that he had heard that a special counsel ruins presidencies, and that the investigation could take "years and years and I won't be able to do anything," the report says."This is the worst thing to ever happen to me," Trump said, according to the report.Mueller was appointed in May 2017, days after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey.The appointment was made by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversaw the probe after Sessions had recused himself.Trump repeatedly berated Sessions for that decision, and he eventually forced Sessions out after the 2018 midterm elections.The Justice Department released the 448-page report Thursday in redacted form.Read it here.
Trump responds to Mueller report: 'No collusion, no obstruction':::::WASHINGTON President Donald Trump on Thursday responded to the release of the highly anticipated report from special counsel Robert Mueller on Russian interference in the 2016 election."They're having a good day, and I'm having a good day too," Trump told a group of veterans at the White House."No collusion, no obstruction," Trump continued."There never was, by the way, and there never will be.And we do have to get to the bottom of these things.This should never happen ... to another president again.This hoax.It should never happen to another president again."After Attorney General William Barr held a news conference explaining takeaways from the Mueller report, Trump tweeted a "Game of Thrones"-inspired image which read "Game Over."Earlier Thursday morning, before Barr's remarks, Trump went on a Twitter tirade against the special counsel's probe.The partially redacted report marks the end of a more than two-year-long federal investigation into Russian state-backed interference in the 2016 presidential election.It also focused on two questions directly related to the president.The first was whether Trump or anyone close to his 2016 presidential campaign coordinated with Russian state-backed hackers to steal and release information intended to damage Democrat Hillary Clinton.After reading the finished report last month, Barr wrote to Congress that Mueller and his team of investigators "did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia."The second question directly related to Trump and addressed in the report concerned whether the president's well-documented efforts to undermine the investigation into his campaign amounted to criminal obstruction of justice.On this question, according to Barr, the special counsel found evidence "on both sides of the question."And Mueller specifically states in the report that while the investigation "does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."Instead, Mueller left it up to the attorney general to decide whether, based on the evidence, the president had criminally obstructed justice.As Barr wrote in his March 24 letter to Congress, after reviewing the evidence Mueller laid out, he and his top deputy at the Justice Department "concluded that the evidence ... is not sufficient to establish that" Trump committed a crime.Trump quickly seized on Barr's summary to claim that the Mueller report amounted to "complete and total exoneration" of himself and his entire campaign on every aspect of the special counsel's probe.Trump's response so far, however, has pointedly ignored the fact that Mueller specifically wrote that his findings did not exonerate the president.But not everyone in Trump's inner circle has been as blithely optimistic about what the report would show.The president's personal legal team spent weeks preparing a counter-report in anticipation of findings that would be damaging to Trump and to the White House.
Special counsel Mueller's report has been released to the public — read key findings here:::::Mueller said his investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference campaign.The team defined coordination as "an agreement tacit or express between the Trump Campaign" and the Kremlin.Here's the full report.Some of Mueller's key findings on the Russian influence campaign include: The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in "sweeping and systematic fashion."Russia's efforts to target the U.S. through the Internet Research Agency influence operation began in 2014.That campaign began as a generalized program designed years earlier to undermine the U.S. electoral system, but by early 2016 morphed into a targeted operation to favor Trump and harm candidate Hillary Clinton.Mueller found that the Trump campaign "expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts" even though the probe did not establish coordination.Content from a Russian IRA-controlled Twitter account was cited or retweeted by Trump campaign officials and surrogates, including Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale and Michael Flynn.The IRA, posing as U.S. political activists, contacted persons affiliated with the Trump campaign in an effort to coordinate pro-Trump rallies.Whistleblower organization WikiLeaks, which is accused of accepting and publishing stolen Democrats' emails allegedly hacked by Russian intelligence, asked Trump Jr. to tweet a link in order to help them with "digging through leaked emails."Trump Jr. tweeted the link two days later.The Trump campaign planned a press strategy and communications campaign based on the possible release of Clinton emails by WikiLeaks, according to Rick Gates, Trump's former deputy campaign chairman.Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort instructed his business partner Gates to provide alleged Russian operative Konstantin Kilimnik "internal polling data."But Mueller's team "did not identify evidence of a connection between Manafort's sharing polling data and Russia's interference in the election."Investigators found "some evidence" that Trump knew about Michael Flynn's calls with the Russian ambassador conversations Flynn was later charged with lying about but the evidence was "inconclusive."Mueller did not subpoena Trump because it would create a substantial delay at a late stage in the investigation.The special counsel considered Trump's written answers, submitted in lieu of a face-to-face interview, "inadequate" but still decided against a subpoena fight.The special counsel accepted the Office of Legal Counsel's view on indicting a sitting president when making a determination about whether Trump obstructed justice.Apart from that precedent, Mueller's investigators said they "recognized" that accusing Trump of a crime "would place burdens on the president's capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional process for addressing presidential misconduct."Former White House counsel Don McGahn was disturbed by Trump's requests in June 2017 that McGahn recommend to the acting attorney general that Mueller "must be removed."The report says McGahn decided "that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre."When then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions told Trump that Mueller had been appointed special counsel, a notetaker for Sessions wrote that Trump slumped back in his chair and said, "Oh my God.This is terrible.This is the end of my Presidency.I'm fucked."The report states: "The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."The redacted version of the report comes less than a month after Barr released a four-page letter summarizing what he called the "principal conclusions" in Mueller's report, including that the investigation did not find any conspiracy or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia.Barr also said that Mueller's report "did not exonerate" the president regarding obstruction of justice, but he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded there wasn't sufficient evidence to charge Trump.The attorney general's summary was made public March 24, two days after Mueller delivered the report to the Justice Department.Democrats, particularly majority lawmakers and committee chairs in the House, have been pressuring Barr to release the full report, without redactions.CNBC is reviewing it now and will continue to update this report.
House Judiciary Chair calls Mueller to testify after AG's press conference:::::House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., called on special counsel Robert Mueller to testify before his committee "no later than May 23."The letter to Mueller was made public on Nadler's Twitter account minutes after Attorney General William Barr said Thursday that the nearly two-year Russia probe found "no collusion" between President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and the Kremlin."As I have already communicated to the Department of Justice, I request your testimony before the Judiciary committee as soon as possible," Nadler wrote to Mueller."But, in any event, no later than May 23, 2019.I look forward to working with you on a mutually agreeable date.""We cannot take Attorney General Barr's word for it.We must read the full Mueller report, and the underlying evidence," he later tweeted.Barr told reporters Thursday that he has "no objection to Bob Mueller personally testifying."The report had not been made public when Barr spoke at the Department of Justice.Mueller was not present at the event."The bottom line," Barr said, was that "after nearly two years of investigation, thousands of subpoenas, and hundreds of warrants and witness interviews, the Special Counsel confirmed that the Russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the Trump campaign or other Americans colluded in those schemes."Nadler's committee, which holds authority to launch an impeachment inquiry against Trump, demanded that Barr release the entire Mueller report and its underlying evidence without redactions.His committee authorized a subpoena for such a report in early April.Barr said that a version "with all redactions removed except those relating to grand-jury information" will later be made available for some members of Congress.The report was released later Thursday.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also called for Mueller to testify in the House and Senate in order to "restore public trust in the handling of the Special Council's Investigation."CNBC's Nadine El-Bawab contributed reporting.
Mueller report recounts 10 'episodes' involving Trump and questions of obstruction:::::Barr's press conference will only fuel more concerns about his independence.Congressional Democrats have questioned why the attorney general decided not to charge Trump, especially because of a memo he wrote criticizing the Mueller investigation before the president chose him to lead the Justice Department.Barr told reporters Thursday he felt the Justice Department "had to" decide whether Trump's conduct was criminal because Muller did not.In outlining the department's decision not to charge Trump with trying to derail the probe, the attorney general said officials considered not only whether the "acts were obstructive" but also the president's motives behind his actions.Barr said the DOJ considered the "unprecedented situation" Trump faced entering office and what he called "substantial evidence" in Mueller's report "to show that the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief" that the probe undermined his presidency.He added: Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel's investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims.And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation.Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.It is unclear exactly which "episodes" related to obstruction questions that Mueller outlines in the report.The release of the redacted document could cast more light on which events the special counsel probed.Trump's lawyers saw the final version of the redacted report "earlier this week," but did not request to redact anything from it, Barr said.Several members of the president's legal team went to the Justice Department on Tuesday and Wednesday to view the document, NBC News reported.Barr noted that he and Rosenstein "disagreed with some of the special counsel's legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law."It is unclear which theories the two officials disputed.Asked Thursday about the potential for accusations of political motives, the attorney general pointed to Mueller's report itself."Actually, the statements about his sincere beliefs are recognized in the report that there was substantial evidence for that.I'm not sure what your basis is for saying I'm being generous to the president," the attorney general said.Read Barr's full remarks on the probe, as prepared for delivery Thursday: Good Morning.Thank you all for being here today.On March 22, 2019, Special Counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation of matters related to Russian attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election and submitted his confidential report to me pursuant to Department of Justice regulations.As I said during my Senate confirmation hearing and since, I am committed to ensuring the greatest possible degree of transparency concerning the Special Counsel's investigation, consistent with the law.At 11:00 this morning, I will transmit copies of a public version of the Special Counsel's report to the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees.The Department of Justice will also make the report available to the American public by posting it on the Department's website after it has been delivered to Congress.I would like to offer a few comments today on the report.But before I do that, I want to thank Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for joining me here today and for his assistance and counsel throughout this process.Rod has served the Department of Justice for many years with dedication and distinction, and it has been a great privilege and pleasure to work with him since my confirmation.He had well-deserved plans to step back from public service that I interrupted by asking him to help in my transition.Rod has been an invaluable partner, and I am grateful that he was willing to help me and has been able to see the Special Counsel's investigation to its conclusion.Thank you, Rod.I would also like to thank Special Counsel Mueller for his service and the thoroughness of his investigation, particularly his work exposing the nature of Russia's attempts to interfere in our electoral process.As you know, one of the primary purposes of the Special Counsel's investigation was to determine whether members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump, or any individuals associated with that campaign, conspired or coordinated with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 election.Volume I of the Special Counsel's report describes the results of that investigation.As you will see, the Special Counsel's report states that his "investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities."I am sure that all Americans share my concerns about the efforts of the Russian government to interfere in our presidential election.As the Special Counsel's report makes clear, the Russian government sought to interfere in our election.But thanks to the Special Counsel's thorough investigation, we now know that the Russian operatives who perpetrated these schemes did not have the cooperation of President Trump or the Trump campaign or the knowing assistance of any other Americans for that matter.That is something that all Americans can and should be grateful to have confirmed.The Special Counsel's report outlines two main efforts by the Russian government to influence the 2016 election: First, the report details efforts by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company with close ties to the Russian government, to sow social discord among American voters through disinformation and social media operations.Following a thorough investigation of this disinformation campaign, the Special Counsel brought charges in federal court against several Russian nationals and entities for their respective roles in this scheme.Those charges remain pending, and the individual defendants remain at large.But the Special Counsel found no evidence that any Americans including anyone associated with the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government or the IRA in carrying out this illegal scheme.Indeed, as the report states, "[t]he investigation did not identify evidence that any U.S. persons knowingly or intentionally coordinated with the IRA's interference operation."Put another way, the Special Counsel found no "collusion" by any Americans in the IRA's illegal activity.Second, the report details efforts by Russian military officials associated with the GRU to hack into computers and steal documents and emails from individuals affiliated with the Democratic Party and the presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton for the purpose of eventually publicizing those emails.Obtaining such unauthorized access into computers is a federal crime.Following a thorough investigation of these hacking operations, the Special Counsel brought charges in federal court against several Russian military officers for their respective roles in these illegal hacking activities.Those charges are still pending and the defendants remain at large.But again, the Special Counsel's report did not find any evidence that members of the Trump campaign or anyone associated with the campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its hacking operations.In other words, there was no evidence of Trump campaign "collusion" with the Russian government's hacking.The Special Counsel's investigation also examined Russian efforts to publish stolen emails and documents on the internet.The Special Counsel found that, after the GRU disseminated some of the stolen materials through its own controlled entities, DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0, the GRU transferred some of the stolen materials to Wikileaks for publication.Wikileaks then made a series of document dumps.The Special Counsel also investigated whether any member or affiliate of the Trump campaign encouraged or otherwise played a role in these dissemination efforts.Under applicable law, publication of these types of materials would not be criminal unless the publisher also participated in the underlying hacking conspiracy.Here too, the Special Counsel's report did not find that any person associated with the Trump campaign illegally participated in the dissemination of the materials.Finally, the Special Counsel investigated a number of "links" or "contacts" between Trump Campaign officials and individuals connected with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential campaign.After reviewing those contacts, the Special Counsel did not find any conspiracy to violate U.S. law involving Russia-linked persons and any persons associated with the Trump campaign.So that is the bottom line.After nearly two years of investigation, thousands of subpoenas, and hundreds of warrants and witness interviews, the Special Counsel confirmed that the Russian government sponsored efforts to illegally interfere with the 2016 presidential election but did not find that the Trump campaign or other Americans colluded in those schemes.After finding no underlying collusion with Russia, the Special Counsel's report goes on to consider whether certain actions of the President could amount to obstruction of the Special Counsel's investigation.As I addressed in my March 24th letter, the Special Counsel did not make a traditional prosecutorial judgment regarding this allegation.Instead, the report recounts ten episodes involving the President and discusses potential legal theories for connecting these actions to elements of an obstruction offense.After carefully reviewing the facts and legal theories outlined in the report, and in consultation with the Office of Legal Counsel and other Department lawyers, the Deputy Attorney General and I concluded that the evidence developed by the Special Counsel is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.Although the Deputy Attorney General and I disagreed with some of the Special Counsel's legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we did not rely solely on that in making our decision.Instead, we accepted the Special Counsel's legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the Special Counsel in reaching our conclusion.In assessing the President's actions discussed in the report, it is important to bear in mind the context.President Trump faced an unprecedented situation.As he entered into office, and sought to perform his responsibilities as President, federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office, and the conduct of some of his associates.At the same time, there was relentless speculation in the news media about the President's personal culpability.Yet, as he said from the beginning, there was in fact no collusion.And as the Special Counsel's report acknowledges, there is substantial evidence to show that the President was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents, and fueled by illegal leaks.Nonetheless, the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel's investigation, providing unfettered access to campaign and White House documents, directing senior aides to testify freely, and asserting no privilege claims.And at the same time, the President took no act that in fact deprived the Special Counsel of the documents and witnesses necessary to complete his investigation.Apart from whether the acts were obstructive, this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the President had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation.Now, before I take questions, I want to address a few aspects of the process for producing the public report that I am releasing today.As I said several times, the report contains limited redactions relating to four categories of information.To ensure as much transparency as possible, these redactions have been clearly labelled and color-coded so that readers can tell which redactions correspond to which categories.As you will see, most of the redactions were compelled by the need to prevent harm to ongoing matters and to comply with court orders prohibiting the public disclosure of information bearing upon ongoing investigations and criminal cases, such as the IRA case and the Roger Stone case.These redactions were applied by Department of Justice attorneys working closely together with attorneys from the Special Counsel's Office, as well as with the intelligence community, and prosecutors who are handling ongoing cases.The redactions are their work product.Consistent with long-standing Executive Branch practice, the decision whether to assert Executive privilege over any portion of the report rested with the President of the United States.Because the White House voluntarily cooperated with the Special Counsel's investigation, significant portions of the report contain material over which the President could have asserted privilege.And he would have been well within his rights to do so.Following my March 29th letter, the Office of the White House Counsel requested the opportunity to review the redacted version of the report in order to advise the President on the potential invocation of privilege, which is consistent with long-standing practice.Following that review, the President confirmed that, in the interests of transparency and full disclosure to the American people, he would not assert privilege over the Special Counsel's report.Accordingly, the public report I am releasing today contains redactions only for the four categories that I previously outlined, and no material has been redacted based on executive privilege.In addition, earlier this week, the President's personal counsel requested and were given the opportunity to read a final version of the redacted report before it was publicly released.That request was consistent with the practice followed under the Ethics in Government Act, which permitted individuals named in a report prepared by an Independent Counsel the opportunity to read the report before publication.The President's personal lawyers were not permitted to make, and did not request, any redactions.In addition to making the redacted report public, we are also committed to working with Congress to accommodate their legitimate oversight interests with respect to the Special Counsel's investigation.We have been consulting with Chairman Graham and Chairman Nadler throughout this process, and we will continue to do so.Given the limited nature of the redactions, I believe that the publicly released report will allow every American to understand the results of the Special Counsel's investigation.Nevertheless, in an effort to accommodate congressional requests, we will make available to a bipartisan group of leaders from several Congressional committees a version of the report with all redactions removed except those relating to grand-jury information.Thus, these members of Congress will be able to see all of the redacted material for themselves with the limited exception of that which, by law, cannot be shared.I believe that this accommodation, together with my upcoming testimony before the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, will satisfy any need Congress has for information regarding the Special Counsel's investigation.Once again, I would like to thank you all for being here today.I now have a few minutes for questions.
Capitalism trumps democracy for Trump Fed pick Stephen Moore:::::"Capitalism versus socialism," reads the Republican 2020 bumper sticker.Now, one of President Donald Trump's Federal Reserve picks has written an alternative Democrats like better.That new framework is "capitalism versus democracy."Whether or not he ever takes a Fed board seat, Stephen Moore has brought that less-flattering trade-off into focus.Moore, after years with the Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, Club for Growth and Wall Street Journal editorial board, represents mainstream Republican economic thinking.As he awaits formal nomination by the White House, no GOP senator has opposed him.But the scrutiny underway since Trump tweeted his intent to nominate Moore highlights a theme Republicans rarely emphasize: That democracy, rather than being the well-spring of the American system, can be a used as weapon for struggling have-nots to prey on the affluent by seizing their wealth."Capitalism is a lot more important than democracy," Moore once told a documentary filmmaker."I'm not even a big believer in democracy.I always say that democracy can be two wolves and a sheep deciding what to have for dinner."Republicans have long invoked the specter of "socialism" in opposing Democratic proposals to expand government by levying taxes to finance benefit programs.They used that rationale to oppose the creation of Social Security in the 1930s, Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s, and Obamacare a decade ago.Lately, a few prominent Democrats have made that charge easier to make.The front-runner among declared 2020 presidential candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, calls himself a democratic socialist; so does fiery first-term Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, which explains why conservatives shower her with attention.In reality, both parties traditionally have supported neither socialism nor unregulated capitalism.Instead they back the "mixed economy" that exists throughout Western societies Democrats preferring more government regulations and services to temper market outcomes, Republicans fewer.But the rising influence of unalloyed conservatism since the Reagan era has increasingly placed GOP economic policies at odds with the preferences of the electorate.Voters want to preserve major benefit programs while raising taxes on major corporations and wealthy Americans.A Democracy Fund study of Trump voters following the 2016 election found that, among the core supporters who propelled Trump to the GOP nomination, 75% favor higher taxes on the rich.Republican policymakers, by contrast, view the giant Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid programs as fiscal burdens.And they oppose higher taxes not just on practical grounds but in principle, as improper confiscation from owners of property.When President Barack Obama proposed tax hikes on private equity executives in 2010, Blackstone Group billionaire Steve Schwarzman, now an outside Trump advisor, declared it "like when Hitler invaded Poland."In a radio interview unearthed by CNN, Moore called the early 20th century constitutional amendment permitting a federal income tax "the most evil act that has passed in 100 years."Ex-House Speaker Paul Ryan used to call 60% of Americans "takers" who consume more services than they paid for in taxes, and the other 40% "makers" stuck with the bill.In 2017, Trump budget director Mick Mulvaney derided deficit-spending on government programs as "theft" from taxpayers."We will reverse that larceny," Mulvaney wrote in a newspaper column.Trump and the GOP Congress subsequently enacted a large tax cut benefiting businesses and the wealthy more than everyone else.Those priorities have grown ever harder to sustain in an age of stagnant working-class wages and widening income inequality.As Democrats have won the popular vote in six of the past seven presidential elections, Republicans have increasingly sought to impede steps to make voting easier, most conspicuously through new voter identification requirements.When newly empowered House Democrats this year passed legislation to make voting easier and reduce partisan gerrymandering, the GOP response highlighted its predicament."A power grab," declared Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.Now Democratic presidential candidates have upped the pro-democracy ante with plans to expand the Supreme Court, abolish the Electoral College and eliminate the Senate legislative filibuster.South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a former McKinsey business consultant, specifically repudiated Moore's assertion that capitalism matters most."America is a capitalist society, but it's got to be democratic capitalism," Buttigieg told NBC's "Meet the Press.""If you want to see what happens when you have capitalism without democracy, you can see it very clearly in Russia.It turns into crony capitalism.And that turns into oligarchy."
Trump slams 'Crooked, Dirty Cops' in furious tweets before Mueller release:::::President Donald Trump lashed out at "Crooked, Dirty Cops" and the Democratic National Committee in a series of heated tweets Thursday ahead of the release of a redacted version of Robert Mueller's long-awaited Russia report.Trump, who did not mention the probe of Russian election interference directly but has regularly denounced it as a hoax and a "witch hunt," tweeted Thursday morning about "The Greatest Political Hoax of all time!"The president also shared on Twitter a video mashup of him saying there was "no collusion" between his presidential campaign and Russia.Attorney General William Barr was scheduled to hold a press conference at the Justice Department at 9:30 a.m.ET before releasing to the public a redacted version of the special counsel's nearly 400-page report on Russia's interference and possible coordination with Trump's campaign and whether the president committed obstruction of justice.Democrats including House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York have criticized the timing, accusing Trump's recently appointed attorney general of attempting to establish a narrative about the findings in the report.In a four-page letter last month, Barr said Mueller did not find sufficient evidence of a conspiracy between Trump's campaign and the Kremlin.Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also concluded that Trump did not illegally obstruct justice.At the press conference, Barr will address whether the White House invoked executive privilege related to parts of the report, as well as the department's interactions with the White House regarding the contents of the report, according to a DOJ spokeswoman.Barr will also talk about the process officials followed when redacting certain portions of the report for a public release.Questions about what will be redacted have become especially controversial on Capitol Hill, as some Democratic leaders continue to demand that Barr provide for them the full report along with all of its underlying evidence.Barr has signaled his resistance to hand the lawmakers a completely unscrubbed report, but the DOJ does plan to share a less-redacted version with some members of Congress and their staff some time after the public version has been released, according to a court filing in the Roger Stone case.In a follow-up, Trump sent a two-word tweet exclaiming "PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!"That phrase has become a familiar refrain for the president in the final months of the special counsel's 22-month investigation.The president also encouraged his nearly 60 million followers to watch Barr's press conference on Fox News.
DC Heads to 100% Renewable Energy, a Symbolic Move for the Country:::::As the Trump administration moves to dismantle federal laws to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Washington, D.C., is working to bring renewable energy to the White House and the rest of the city.Under a law approved in December, the District of Columbia will require that all of its electricity come from renewable sources by 2032, the most ambitious timetable in the country.Federal buildings would be included."Its doable, it works, its not some pie-in-the-sky idea," said Mark Rodeffer, the chairman of the Sierra Clubs Washington, D.C., chapter, which backed the law."In 13 years, the U.S. Capitol is going to be powered by electricity that is 100 percent from wind and solar.At the same time, some climate deniers in the Capitol are going to be saying this is impossible to do, but theyre going to be saying that under lights that are powered by wind and solar, disproving the argument that theyre making."Washington, D.C., has the tightest deadline, but it follows the lead of Hawaii and California, both of which earlier committed to 100 percent clean energy by 2045.Hawaii, the most petroleum-dependent of the 50 states, acted in 2015 and California, a leader in environmental advances, voted last fall.More than 100 cities also have have pledged to move to completely clean, renewable energy, and a half a dozen smaller ones have already reached that goal, according to the Sierra Club.Pollen Problems: How Climate Change Supersizes Allergy Season Climate change is changing pollen production patterns and impacting everyone with seasonal allergies.Take a deeper look at the problem and see what you can do to help fight off the coughing and sneezing.(Published Monday, April 22, 2019) Cities account for more than three-quarters of primary energy use but also are the most vulnerable to power disruptions linked to climate change, notes C40 Cities, a network of the worlds mega-cities that are addressing climate change.Ninety percent of all urban areas are on a coast, at risk from flooding from rising sea levels and powerful storms.Seventy percent of cities are already seeing the effects of climate change.When Donald Trump was elected president, questioning whether climate change was real and promising he would gut attempts to cut carbon emissions, officials looked for ways to keep environmental progress headed forward.Absent a strong federal presence, cities, states and companies have taken the lead.One of Trumps early policy decisions as president was to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, a worldwide attempt to confront climate change.In response, D.C. has banded together with New York, Los Angeles and other C40 cities to meet the agreement's goals primarily to keep the global temperature increase this century to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to try to limit the temperature rise even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius."The residents of Washington, D.C., expect local government to provide leadership to mitigate global warming," said Tommy Wells, the director of the Districts Department of Energy and Environment.The goal is to make the city carbon neutral by 2050.The Clean Energy D.C. Act of 2018 is expected to cut emissions in half by 2032.By 2041, 10 percent of the electricity must come from solar facilities located in the District of Columbia or within the area of the regional transmission organization that serves the District, PJM Interconnection.PJM Interconnection coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in the District, Maryland, Virginia and all or parts of 11 other states.Climate Change Could Change Cost, Taste of Beer New research says climate change is brewing trouble for the beer industry.Storm Team4 Meteorologist Amelia Draper explains the impact on the cost and taste of beer.(Published Thursday, March 14, 2019) The act also encourages the purchase of electric vehicles and requires that all public transportation and privately owned fleet vehicles to become emissions-free by the year 2045.It strengthens energy efficiency standards for new and existing buildings, which account for 74 percent of Washington D.C.'s greenhouse gas emissions.The District is the first jurisdiction to mandate buildings meet energy performance standards, which will be based on federal energy efficiency criteria, Wells said.Within five years every building must create a plan for meeting the standards, or the District will impose one.A green energy bank, funded with up to $100 million, will help multi-family buildings with affordable housing, he said.The new requiremens are meant to bring additional, clean energy production online -- solar and wind though not nuclear power and hydropower -- and to move the district's electricity supplier away from purchasing energy credits in favor of long-term contracts."Its a matter of supply and demand," Rodeffer said."People will build more wind and solar farms because the demand is increasing.So that will expand renewable energy production, which is what this is all about."Activists are hoping other municipalities and states will follow the lead of the nations capital.Marylands General Assembly passed a bill earlier this month that mandates half of the states electricity supply comes from renewable sources by 2030.Republican Gov.Larry Hogan vetoed a similar bill in 2016, but Democrats overrode his veto to set the current goal of 25 percent.Marylands secretary of the environment, Benjamin Grumbles, said this week that the governors office was reviewing the new bill.Since California passed its 100 percent renewable electricity standard last year, at least nine states, including Connecticut, Illinois, Maine and New York, were considering similar proposals, The Los Angeles Times noted.The biggest challenge facing California is its reliance on natural gas.Global Student Walkout to Demand Action on Climate Change Hundreds of thousands of students in more than 100 countries skipped school Friday to demand action on climate change.Kids in more than 1,200 cities across the globe are protesting a failure of governments to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.The Fridays for Future rallies were one of the biggest international climate change actions yet.(Published Friday, March 15, 2019) Renewable energy now provides just a small percentage of electricity to customers who get their electricity from D.C.'s primary electricity supplier, Pepco Holdings -- which is about 84 percent of its 308,000 customers.The remainder purchase their energy through an alternative supplier.For the first six months of last year, renewable energy was the source of just 5.8 percent of the District's electricity.Renewable energy credits, certificates that can be traded, made up the difference of a 16.5 percent renewable requirement.The source of most of the District's electricity was nuclear at 35.3 percent, followed by coal at 29.8 percent, natural gas at 28.7 percent, and oil at 0.3 percent."Weve been taking the stand for a long time now that climate change is real, we have to act, we have to act urgently, and we have to use all available carbon-free technologies that we have at our disposal today and we should be creating policies that encourage innovative and that allow us to take advantage any new carbon-free technologies that develop tomorrow," said Pepcos senior vice president of governmental and external affairs, Melissa Lavinson."Our focus is on carbon and carbon reduction, what investments are needed, what can we do, what can others do and how can we work together to most expeditiously and affordably achieve our climate change goals."The need to act was heightened by last years report from the United Nations scientific panel on climate change, which warned that the immediate consequences would be much worse than thought.The report, the first commissioned under the Paris agreement, describes wildfires, a mass die-off of coral reefs and food shortages if the worlds economy was not changed at an unprecedented speed.NASA Scientist Uses Comedy to Talk Climate Change Josh Willis is an accomplished NASA scientist, but his night job is using comedy to spark the conversation on climate change.Belen De Leon and Tommy Bravo report for NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on April 7, 2019.(Published Monday, April 8, 2019) The Fourth National Climate Assessment, a separate report by 300 federal and non-governmental agencies that was released on Black Friday, outlined the real-time effects of climate change across the U.S., broken down by region."Americans increasingly recognize the risks climate change poses to their everyday lives and livelihoods and are beginning to respond," the report said.Economists such as Noah Kaufman, a researcher who works on energy and climate change policy at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, favor a national approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Climate change is a global problem which should be tackled at the highest levels of government, he said."Its also really important to make sure that we are reducing emissions cost effectively because if were serious about deep emissions cuts, getting to a truly low carbon economy, that implies a real transformation of our energy system which means big changes to our economy," said Kaufman, a former deputy associate director of energy and climate change at the White House Council on Environmental Quality under President Barack Obama."I think were kidding ourselves if we think thats going to be easy or cheap."Kaufman acknowledged the constraints to passing climate change policy in todays political climate, particularly a new tax.Mike Tidwell, the founder and director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, a grassroots nonprofit organization focused on Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., called the Districts electricity goals a new bar for the rest of the country on climate action."Its one of the main reasons we worked to pass the bill," Tidwell said."The government and the people of the nations capital with almost 800,000 people have adopted this.Theyre moving in this direction."As for the White House: "Whether they like or not, it's coming," he said.
NY-Based Artist Displays 'Obama Paintings' in Chicago to Highlight Presidential Legacy:::::Over the course of former President Barack Obamas presidency, artist Rob Pruitt took it upon himself to paint a portrait of the politician within the context of a significant event that transpired that day, every day for eight years while he was in office.In honor of the 10th anniversary of President Obamas first inauguration, an exhibit at the Rebuild Foundations Stony Island Arts Bank in Chicago displays a series of "Obama Paintings"a total of 2,922 portraits to be exact.At the end of a presidency, everybody scurries about trying to figure out what that presidents legacy will be.I did not want to highlight big moments moments like the signing of the Affordable Care Act, the Iran Nuclear Deal, or the capture of Osama bin Laden I wanted to depict a very measured, intellectual, capable statesman who showed up to work everyday and led; a leader with a long list of accomplishments we, as a nation, would be proud of.Rob Pruitt The quote above is highlighted in large lettering, front and center inside the exhibit.The artist said the idea was first sparked 10 years ago when Obama was just a candidate.Pruitt said although he doesnt consider himself a political junkie, he was so moved and inspired by Obamas message that he began to sign up for community events near where he resides in lower Manhattan.It was such a thrill when Obama was elected and I thought to myself, what am I going to do with all of this energy from the campaign that I still had?Pruitt explained.It felt to me, like the first time in my lifethat I really connected with a politician.The background of each painting is based on a gradient fade of the American flags colors and Pruitt said each portrait is meant to showcase a dedicated, public servant who showed up to work every day and made important decisions to make sure that all of our health and safety was protected.Pruitt made sure to capture not just the moments while in office, but also the regular, friendly, everyday family man.The "Obama Paintings" debuted Thursday and the new Chicago exhibit is scheduled to run through August 25, 2019.Stony Island Arts Bank is set to host programming in conjunction with the exhibition, according to a statement released, including an artist's talk, workshops, and special performances exploring the relationship between art and civic engagement.All events are free and open to the public.Pruitt said the end goal is not so much about the sale of the paintings but rather preserving the art in a safe space and more importantly, that young individuals and students are able to learn and understand Obama's time in office.I hope that it just reminds each of us of the importance of the presidency and what it means even in our own lives to wake up every morning, to do a good job, he said.
GOP Congressman Climbs 'Border' Wall, Doesn't Actually Make It to Mexico:::::In this Tuesday, Nov. 6, 2018 photo Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., speaks during an interview at a call center on in Santee, Calif. GOP Rep. Duncan Hunter is facing backlash for pretending to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, NBC News reports something his Democratic opponent says would have violated the terms of the congressman's parole stemming from federal charges of misusing campaign funds.The California lawmaker posted a video on social media on Thursday claiming to be "15 meters" from the U.S.-Mexico border before walking over to a fence he alleged was the only thing separating migrants seeking asylum from entering the U.S. by foot.Border Patrol officials told The Times of San Diego that the official border is the Colorado River, which is further away from the vehicle barrier Hunter crossed.Ammar Campa-Najjar, a Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Hunter for his seat last November, slammed Hunter for the video on social media."This is what happens when youve been stripped from all your committees & have too much time on your hands," he tweeted.Michael Harrison, a spokesman for Hunter, told The Times of San Diego that the accusation of him violating his parole by leaving the U.S. is a "non-issue typical of someone desperate for a headline."Mueller Report: 10 Instances of Possible Obstruction of Justice by Trump

I'm Effed: Trump's Reaction to Mueller's Appointment, Other Top Takeaways From the Redacted Mueller Report:::::A redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian election meddling and President Donald Trump has been released to Congress and the public.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) A 448-page report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller gives an inside look at Donald Trump's tumultuous campaign and presidency and its possible links to Russians who tried to help win him the presidency.The report says there's not enough evidence to charge Trump with a crime, but it details vague responses to questions and staff members deleting key communications.Here are some key takeaways from the Mueller report, the conclusion of a 22-month investigation that looked at the question of the Russian interference and whether the president tried to obstruct the probe.Trump Cursed When Told of Mueller's Appointment After the special counsel was appointed in May 2017, Trump reacted with anger: Oh my God.This is terrible.This is the end of my Presidency.Im F*****, according to notes from Jody Hunt, the attorney generals chief of staff.Trump then told Jeff Sessions to resign as attorney general.Sessions submitted a resignation letter the next day, but Trump decided to retain Sessions.Trump Demanded Muellers Removal Trump directed White House Counsel Don McGahn in May 2017 to call Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to have Mueller removed as special counsel.Mueller Report: 10 Instances of Possible Obstruction of Justice by Trump Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election included instances of potential obstruction by President Donald Trump.Here is a rundown of the ten mentioned in the report.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) McGahn's clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein not only that conflicts existed but also that Mueller has to go, the report says.McGahn refused the directive and was prepared to resign over it he told then White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus that the President had asked him to do crazy sh*t, according to the report.Mueller was never fired.Trump was told he was under investigation In December 2017, the special counsels office advised the presidents lawyers that Trump was the subject of an investigation although Trump has repeatedly said since that he is not the subject of an investigation.Mueller determined that the Trump campaign had not conspired or coordinated with the Russian government, but the presidents team did think it would benefit from the Russian attempts to publish stolen emails.The report found that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign in what it called sweeping and systemic fashion, and also that the Trump campaign expected to benefit from those efforts."The Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the report said.A Timeline of Muellers Russia Investigation On May 17, 2017, former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to oversee the investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.He secured the conviction of one Trump associate, guilty pleas from several others and the indictment of Russians who allegedly interfered in the 2016 election.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) Nonetheless the investigation did not establish that member of the Trump Campaign conspired and coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities, the report said.Barr in his letter to Congress reported the last sentence but omitted the sentence that the Trump campaign thought it would benefit from the stolen emails released on WikiLeaks.Barr earlier told Congress that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the presidential election, one involving a Russian organization called the Internet Research Agency, that used social media in the United States to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election, and the second involving the Russian governments efforts to hack into the emails of Hillary Clintons campaign and Democratic party organizations and publish them through WikiLeaks and other groups.According to Rick Gates, a top campaign official, "by the late summer of 2016, the Trump Campaign was planning a press strategy, a communications campaign and messaging based on the possible release of Clinton emails by WikiLeaks."Trump wanted more Clinton emails After Trump, while a candidate, said on July 27, 2016, that he hoped Russia would find the 30,000 emails that are missing, he asked people affiliated with his campaign to find the deleted Clinton emails.Michael Flynn, later his national security advisor, recalled that Trump made this request repeatedly.Flynn contacted many people in try to obtain the emails.Key Moments From Barr's Presser Prior to Report Release Attorney General William Barr addressed the media prior to his department's release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report to Congress.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) The Trump campaign did have "numerous" contacts with Russians The investigation identified two kinds of connections between members of the Trump campaign and the Internet Research Agency one by linking, retweeting or reposting pro-Trump or anti-Clinton content and two by meeting with agency employees posing as Americans to coordinate political rallies in the United States.Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale and Michael Flynn all liked or promoted social posts originally posted by the IRA.If Mueller could have exonerated the president, he would have Mueller wrote that because the members of his team were determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, they did not draw ultimate conclusions about the presidents actions and his intent.The evidence they obtained would need to be resolved if it were to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, the report said.At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state, the report said.Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.Trump associates deleted relevant communications The office said that some of those they interviewed or investigated, including some associated with the Trump campaign, had deleted relevant communications or used encrypted applications that did not provide for long-term retention of data.In those cases the office could not corroborate witness statements or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known facts.Trump Reiterates No Collusion After Release of Mueller Report President Donald Trump said at a White House event for wounded warriors on Thursday that hes having a good day, following the release of special counsel Robert Muellers report.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) Therefore, the special counsels office could not rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.Trump agreed to respond to written responses on Russian-related questions, but not on obstruction The report notes that Trump did not similarly agree to provide written answers to question on obstruction topics or question on events during the transition.Muellers team sought to interview the president for more than a year, and considered issuing a subpoena for Trump but decided against it because of the likelihood of a long legal battle.Prosecutors also said they believed they had enough evidence and information from other sources to draw "relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility, the report said.The written answers that Trump did provide were not sufficient, according to the report.The President stated on more than 30 occasions that he does not 'recall' or ' remember' or have an ' independent recollection of information called for by the questions.Other answers were incomplete or imprecise,'" the report said.12 mystery cases have been referred to other jurisdictions Two cases that were referred included the case against Trumps longtime associate, Michael Cohen, to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York on financial crimes that he pleaded guilty to and another involving lobbyist Gregory Craig, a White House counsel early in President Barack Obamas administration who has been charged with making false statements about work for the Ukrainian government.But information about 12 other cases were redacted on grounds of harm to ongoing matter.Why were no charges brought after the Trump Tower meeting?Muellers office considered whether to charge Trump campaign officials in connection with a now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in 2016, which Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and others attended after Trump Jr. was told of an offer from Russias Crown prosecutor of official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.'s] father."Trump Jr. responded, if its what you say I love it especially later in the summer.But the lawyer who attended wanted to talk about adoptions and the Magnitsky Act, under which a group of prominent Russians were sanctioned for human rights violations.Prosecutors noted in the report that federal election law bans contributions and donations by foreign nationals but they argued that the special counsels office would have difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the values of the promised documents and information exceeded the $2,000 threshold for a criminal violation or the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment.Although damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign, it appears that the information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable, the report said.

Kamala Harris of California, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, and even Republican hopeful Bill Weld, joined in calling for Barr to resign and for Mueller to testify on his team's findings.It is essential that Special Counsel Bob Mueller come before Congress and address the validity of his report that has been redacted and released," Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, tweeted.Key Moments From Barr's Presser Prior to Report Release Attorney General William Barr addressed the media prior to his department's release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report to Congress.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) On MSNBCs "Morning Joe," Buttigieg called the attorney general's news conference really disturbing.If I were advising a president at a moment like this, I would advise being as transparent as you can, he said.And instead it sounds like what they want to do is describe this thing and then hand it over.Harris said Barr was acting "like Trumps defense attorney" and called his press conference "a stunt, filled with political spin and propaganda.""Americans deserve the unvarnished truth," Harris tweeted."We need Special Counsel Mueller to testify publicly in Congress."Former Texas congressman Beto ORourke, who was canvassing in New Hampshire, was more tight-lipped.As of Thursday mid-afternoon, he had not tweeted about Barr or the Mueller report, and when a reporter asked the candidate to comment, he responded that he didn't have "enough information to share.""But I'm glad that [the report]'s being released, he said.
Key Moments From AG Barr's Press Conference Prior to Redacted Mueller Report's Release:::::
Constraints on presidency being redefined in Trump era, report fallout shows:::::President Trump repeatedly tried to undermine the Russia investigation, but the special counsel overseeing the probe declined to say whether he broke the law and the attorney general declared that he had committed no crime.Trumps campaign showed a willingness to work with a foreign power something his personal lawyer now insists is perfectly okay.And Trump has furiously rejected congressional scrutiny of his presidency taking the unprecedented step Monday of suing a Democratic committee chairman to block a subpoena for his financial records.The events of the past week, following the release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs dramatic 448-page report, are threatening to redefine the legal and ethical standards that have long served as constraints on the American presidency.And they suggest that few, if any, of the traditional guardrails that have kept Trumps predecessors in check remain for this president and possibly those who will follow him.The most disturbing part of the picture thats been drawn about norms is, there is now a crumbling consensus about what they are, said Bob Bauer, White House counsel under President Barack Obama.The Republican defense of Trump has muddied the congressional response, so it now appears that even a president who is a chronic liar, who tried to obstruct justice, who instructed his White House counsel to fabricate evidence, has not apparently conducted himself in a way that everybody can agree violates the norms.Democrats had hoped that Muellers investigation into Russias interference in the 2016 election would serve as a check on what they view as Trumps rampant abuse of power.But Muellers team found there was no conspiracy between Moscow and the campaign while concluding that it could not render a judgment on whether Trump criminally obstructed justice because of government guidelines about indicting a sitting president.This left an emboldened Trump to proclaim complete and total EXONERATION despite the reports numerous details of the presidents efforts to end or stymie Muellers investigation.Trumps aides and supporters have brushed off the details in Muellers report that show the president tried to stop or stymie the special counsels investigation, with even Attorney General William P. Barr describing Trumps actions as understandable given his anger over the probe.They have portrayed Democrats as sore losers for refusing to accept that Mueller did not declare Trump had committed any crimes.But the aftermath of Muellers report, as well as Congresss overall inability to help serve as a check on Trump, has potentially created a precedent in which it remains unclear where the current lines are on presidential behavior.Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director, said that the combination of an attorney general who comes at this from a legal philosophy of very broad executive powers and a president who is more interested in an imperial presidency has created a troubling dynamic where we may have three equal branches of government but one branch the executive one is more equal than the others.Nick Akerman, a former federal prosecutor who served as a member of the Watergate prosecution team, also criticized Barr for stepping in to declare no crime had been committed when Muellers report seemed to leave this decision up to Congress.Its problematic because youve got a renegade attorney general whos basically doing everything he can to twist the law, to make it sound like what Trump did is not a crime, Akerman said.It makes it a lot harder for somebody else, after Trump leaves office, to prosecute him based on the facts Mueller has found that he obstructed justice.On Sunday, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani seemed to further define downward acceptable presidential conduct, telling CNNs State of the Union that theres nothing wrong with taking information from Russians a government the intelligence community and Mueller have concluded interfered in the election to sow discord in the United States.He said the issue was not one of immorality, arguing that nearly every presidential campaign in history has engaged in some sort of immoral or unethical behavior.But, he added, he personally would have advised against accepting information from the Russians, just out of an excess of caution.The repercussions of Muellers report, as well as the unabashed victory lap by Trump and his allies, have created a particular conundrum for Democrats, who are still grappling with the politically fraught question of whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings that are almost certain to die in the Republican-controlled Senate.Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the first major Democratic presidential candidate to call for Trumps impeachment, in a series of Twitter posts on Friday.To ignore a Presidents repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways, she wrote.But Democrats generally remain mixed on how to proceed.Many are reluctant to waste political capital on a mission impeaching Trump they think has little chance for success.But they are also mindful that by not condemning the presidents behavior, they may be seen as tacitly condoning it and helping lower the standards for future occupants of the Oval Office.I think even if we did not win, possibly, if there were not impeachment, I think history would smile upon us for standing up for the Constitution, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.)said Sunday on CBSs Face The Nation, while noting he was not yet ready to begin impeachment proceedings.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told her members Monday night that leaders had no immediate plans to open impeachment proceedings but would continue to investigate Trump, according to officials on the conference call.White House aides said they think the report will cause little long-term political damage because most of the damaging stories were already known and that even some of the presidents most ardent supporters do not view him as a paragon of morality.Several advisers added that they expect Muellers conclusions to cost Trump few votes.I dont think there was a whole lot of information that was new that had not been reported on previously or discussed in a public setting, said Raj Shah, a former White House spokesman who now advises the campaign.It almost seemed like the summary of the last two years of the public debate.I dont think this report gives any momentum to those who want to see the president impeached.Shah added that Trump voters are unlikely to punish the president for fighting back against Muellers probe.The broad notion that the president was disgruntled with and unhappy with an investigation targeting his legitimacy out of the gate they afford him the right to be upset about it, he said.Muellers finding that there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia has now become a key talking point heading into Trumps reelection bid, with his political apparatus planning to target both the investigators and the news media that covered the investigation.Trump has told White House aides that they should expect continued subpoenas and calls for testimony on Capitol Hill, and that he hopes to use that to portray the Democrats as overzealous partisans.And, unlike during Muellers investigation, the president is unlikely to allow all of his current and former aides to testify publicly, according to White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.The White House has already made clear that it plans to fight nearly every request for documents and testimony from Democratic committees, and a senior White House official said the report allows the administration to be more emboldened in pushing back against House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and other congressional investigators.Current and former aides say they do not expect Trump to change his behavior, saying he is unlikely to be responsive to anything other than political pain in the form of a real revolt by Republican leadership or a sharp drop in poll numbers.George Conway, a Republican lawyer and frequent Trump critic who is married to one of the presidents senior advisers, said that Trump may soon feel political repercussions, arguing he should be performing better in public opinion polls given the strength of the economy.Everybody knows that there is not this overwhelming urge and supermajority of public support to remove this guy from office, Conway said.He is his own worst enemy.Hes the reason hes not at 50 or 55 percent-plus with the economy going the way it is.That tells you something about how damaging this has been to him.Trump was showing no signs of backing down on Monday.Asked at the White House Easter Egg Roll whether he was worried about impeachment, he replied, Not even a little bit.And pressed on the portrait that emerges in the Mueller report, of White House aides disregarding his directives and at times working to scuttle his most dangerous impulses, the president was adamant.Nobody disobeys my orders, Trump said.
White House instructs official to ignore Democratic subpoena over security clearances:::::The White House instructed Carl Kline, a former official in charge of security clearances, not to testify before the House Oversight Committee.(Evan Vucci) A former White House personnel security director has been instructed by the White House not to show up Tuesday for questioning by the House Oversight Committee.The move appears to be the latest effort by the Trump administration to push back against congressional inquiries of the White House, which have proliferated since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in January.White House deputy counsel Michael M. Purpura wrote a letter Monday asking the former security director, Carl Kline, not to show up as the committee had requested.Kline is now working at the Defense Department.In a letter to Klines lawyer obtained by The Washington Post, Purpura wrote that a committee subpoena asking Kline to appear "unconstitutionally encroaches on fundamental executive branch interests."In a separate letter Monday, Kline's attorney, Robert Driscoll, told the panel that his client would adhere to the White House recommendation.With two masters from two equal branches of government, we will follow the instructions of the one that employs him, Driscoll wrote in the letter addressed to the committees chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.)Cummings was not available for comment late Monday night.He signed a subpoena earlier this month for Kline to appear Tuesday.That subpoena followed testimony from a White House personnel security whistleblower, Tricia Newbold, who alleged that the White House had been recklessly granting security clearances to individuals whom lower-level administration personnel staff had found unworthy.[Former White House official accused in security clearance dispute to face House committee] Newbold, who processed security clearances under Kline at the White House for the first two years of the administration, told Cummings' panel that more than two dozen denials for security clearances had been overturned during the Trump administration.She said that Congress was her last hope for addressing what she considered to be improper conduct that left the nations secrets exposed.Newbold, an 18-year veteran of the security clearance process who has served under both Republican and Democratic presidents, said she warned her superiors that clearances were not always adjudicated in the best interest of national security and that she faced retaliation for doing so.Among those whose clearance she questioned was presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner, who President Trump ultimately demanded be granted a permanent top-secret clearance, despite the concerns of intelligence officials.Kushner was identified only as Senior White House Official 1 in committee documents released during the first week in April following Newbold's testimony.In her deposition, Newbold said her staff determined that Official 1 had too many significant disqualifying factors to receive a clearance.However, that recommendation was overruled by Kline, the career official who then headed the office, according to Newbolds interview with committee staff.While Kushners security clearance was pending, he held an interim top-secret clearance that at one point also gave him access to some of the governments most sensitive materials, including the presidents daily intelligence brief, The Post has reported.Last February, his clearance was reduced to secret as part of an effort by Kelly to limit the number of White House officials without permanent clearances who had access to highly classified material.Trump then personally directed Kelly to give Kushner a top-secret clearance a move that made Kelly so uncomfortable that he documented the request in writing, according to people familiar with the situation.The letters from the White House and Klines lawyer came late Monday, following a day that began with another confrontation with Congress.Earlier Monday, the Trump Organization filed a lawsuit to prevent an accounting firm from complying with a committee subpoena for eight years worth of Trump financial records.In a statement issued early this month, Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee, accused Cummings of politicizing the security clearance issue, one that he said should be bipartisan.Chairman Cummings investigation is not about restoring integrity to the security clearance process, it is an excuse to go fishing through the personal files of dedicated public servants, Jordan said.Republicans said Cummings cherry-picked excerpts of the closed-door interview with Newbold, whom they characterized as a disgruntled employee with limited knowledge of how security clearance decisions are actually made.Rosalind S.

Harris promises to impose new gun rules if Congress won’t:::::Sen. Kamala D. Harris said Monday that as president she would give Congress 100 days to pass broad gun control legislation and if it failed to do so, she would take executive action to expand background checks, revoke the licenses of gun dealers who break the law and restore fugitives to the list of people who cannot buy a handgun.Upon being elected, I will give Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, Harris (D-Calif.) said at a town hall meeting sponsored by CNN at St. Anselm College.And if they fail to do it, I will take executive action.An aide with Harriss campaign said that the scope of her initiative would go beyond what she outlined at the town hall and that she would also close the boyfriend loophole to prevent convicted domestic abusers from purchasing guns.Harriss comments came during a late-April battle for voter attention as CNN hosted back-to-back town hall events Monday night with five Democratic presidential hopefuls.Harris was preceded by Sens.Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, with South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg following.Like other Democratic candidates, Harris has made gun control a central part of her message, and she has now gone farther than most of her rivals.At stop after campaign stop, she asks voters to consider a family sitting down to dinner anywhere in the country and parents asking their children about their day.In Harriss hypothetical, the children report that their day was marred by an active-shooter drill that forced them to hide in a closet, and they ask their parents why they must do such a thing.The answer, of course, she says, is that so-called leaders in Washington dont have the courage to enact reasonable gun safety laws like universal background checks and a renewed assault weapons ban.Its one of her most reliable applause lines.Republicans argue that such restrictions would violate the rights of gun owners, and many conservatives contend they would be unconstitutional.The way to curb gun violence, they say, is to improve enforcement and security, and some also advocate such measures as more funding for mental health services.Harriss announcement Monday was unusual in setting a specific schedule for gun regulation and a plan for how to deliver if Congress does not.The details of her plan remained unclear, however, including how much success she would have in imposing such regulations without congressional approval.Drafting regulations and then implementing them can be time-consuming.Such measures would almost certainly prompt a backlash from gun owners and the National Rifle Association, which would probably challenge them in court.Executive action encompasses a variety of presidential directives.Executive orders are the best-known type of presidential edict, but not the only one.According to a campaign aide, Harriss approach would be to take steps such as ordering the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to craft regulations that define a gun dealer as someone who sells five or more firearms a year.That would have the effect of increasing the number of sellers who must conduct background checks.Harris would also direct ATF to redefine its definition of domestic relationships to include dating relationships, with a goal of closing the loophole that allows those convicted of domestic abuse to purchase firearms if they are not married to the person they abused, the aide said.The ATF has been doing a lot of the A and the T, but not much of the F, Harris said.Harris also plans to act if Congress doesnt repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which prevents lawsuits against gun dealers and manufacturers for violence perpetrated with their wares.A campaign aide said that if the PLCAA were not repealed in Harriss first 100 days, her administration would revoke the licenses of any companies willfully violating local, state and federal law, and would prosecute the most egregious offenders.Any fines from that litigation would go toward expanding access to mental health treatment and trauma care.Sanders is the only one of Harriss presidential rivals who was in the Senate when the PLCAA was passed in 2005, and he voted in favor of it.He has since said he supports repealing it.Sanders, like Klobuchar, Warren, Buttigieg, and most of Harriss other competitors, supports increased gun control, which has become a staple of the 2020 Democratic position.Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.) has made gun control a core issue of his candidacy, and he has gone farther than the rest of the field in calling for a mandatory national ban and buyback of military-style semiautomatic assault weapons.Harris made further news Monday when she said she thinks Congress should begin steps toward impeaching President Trump, a stance first taken by fellow 2020 candidates Warren and Julin Castro, and one she had not stated until Monday night.Mondays gun control announcement was Harriss second major policy initiative announcement as a candidate.She previously introduced a plan to increase teacher salaries with federal funds.
Sen. Kamala Harris says she supports impeaching Trump:::::Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) speaks at the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority South Central Regional Conference in New Orleans on Friday.(Gerald Herbert/AP) Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) on Monday called for the House to impeach President Trump, becoming the latest 2020 presidential contender to do so after the release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.I believe Congress should take the steps toward impeachment, Harris said at a CNN town hall in Manchester, N.H.While Republicans would likely defend Trump out of partisan adherence, Harris added, that does not mean that the process should not take hold.It is very clear that there is a lot of good evidence pointing to obstruction, she said.Harris had previously refrained from backing impeachment, saying during an MSNBC appearance Thursday night that there was definitely a conversation to be had on that subject.Other candidates speaking at Mondays five back-to-back, hour-long town halls were Sens.Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)as well as Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) of South Bend, Ind.Last week, Warren became the first Democratic White House candidate to call for the House to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump in light of Muellers findings.At Mondays town hall, Warren gave an impassioned defense of her call for impeachment, telling the crowd, I took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States, and so did everybody else in the Senate and in the House.Sen. Elizabeth Warren: "If there are people in the House and the Senate who want to say that's what a President can do then they should have to take that vote and live with it for the rest of their lives" #WarrenTownHall https://t.co/hlARGBmSUM pic.twitter.com/YrA4c04Aof CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) April 23, 2019 Sanders, meanwhile, was among those calling for Democrats to steer clear of impeachment and instead keep their eye on issues that concern ordinary Americans.What I worry about is that works to Trumps advantage, he said of beginning impeachment proceedings.There has got to be a thorough investigation, and I think the House Democrats will do it.House Democratic leaders have been hesitant to pursue impeachment, arguing that their party should instead keep its focus on investigating Trump and seeing where the inquiries by various House committees lead.In a conference call Monday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reaffirmed that approach, telling lawmakers, Its about saving our democracy.Warren used similar language in making her appeal for impeachment, contending that the United States has a system of checks and balances for a reason and that members of Congress must take action to protect democracy now as well as for future generations.In a dictatorship, everything in government revolves around protecting the one person at the center.But not in our democracy, Warren said.A redacted version of Muellers report was released late last week.The report identified 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Trump.But Mueller did not find that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.Warren said Monday that if anyone but Trump had taken similar actions, they would be arrested and put in jail.If there are people in the House or the Senate who want to say thats what a president can do when the president is being investigated for his own wrongdoings or when a foreign government attacks our country, then they should have to take that vote and live with it for the rest of their lives, she said.She also dismissed the argument that impeachment would take the focus away from health care, the environment, the economy and other issues that Democrats have sought to highlight ahead of the 2020 election.If youve actually read the Mueller report, its all laid out there, she said.Its not like its going to take a long time to figure this out.Its there.Its got the footnotes.Its got the points.It connects directly to the law.Other Democrats were less than enthusiastic Monday about the prospect of impeachment.Klobuchar said Trump should be held accountable and that Mueller should testify before the Senate.But she said the decision on whether to impeach should be left up to the House.Im not going to predispose things, she said.Sanders called Trump the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country.But he said he worries that Democrats would help Trump get reelected if all Congress is talking about is impeaching Trump and Trump, Trump, Trump and Mueller, Mueller, Mueller.Sanders also found himself on the defensive during the town hall when asked whether his support for voting rights for felons means that he would be in favor of enfranchising people like the Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, as well as those convicted of sexual assault.Sen. Bernie Sanders says the right to vote should be extended "even for terrible people" #SandersTownHall https://t.co/iTqKWMaexp pic.twitter.com/eiIGZGUd6C CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) April 23, 2019 Sanders responded that he backs voting rights even for terrible people, because otherwise, it is a slippery slope.Janes reported from Manchester, N.H.

Trump says ‘nobody disobeys my orders.’ Here are 15 recorded instances of exactly that.:::::President Trump attended a bilateral meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2017.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) There is a narrative forming about the Mueller report.It says President Trump would be in a lot more trouble right now if those around him actually did what he told them to do.By essentially ignoring the boss on potentially obstructive acts, the narrative holds, these aides may have saved Trump from himself.Needless to say, this is not the kind of narrative a proud man like Trump prefers.So, he did what he always does on stuff like this: Deny it, no matter how ridiculous that denial might be.Nobody disobeys my orders, Trump assured Monday morning at the White House Easter Egg Roll.How wrong he is.Let us count the ways.The Mueller report includes many instances of aides declining to carry out Trumps orders; The Washington Posts James Hohmann recapped them on Friday.But its worth running through which ones actually involved orders that aides disobeyed.(For the purposes of this post, were not including mere suggestions, such as when Trump pressured then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to un-recuse himself and when Trump urged then-FBI Director James B. Comey to take it easy on Michael Flynn.)Toward the bottom of the list, we have also added previously known incidents of top aides declining to carry out Trumps orders.The list: White House counsel Donald McGahn: Declined to tell Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to fire Mueller.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski: Declined to apply pressure on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the scope of the Russia probe.Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn: Declined to give Sessions a typed note Lewandowski gave him relaying the presidents message.Staff secretary Rob Porter: Declined Trumps request to ask the No.3-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rachel Brand, whether she wanted to be attorney general and take oversight of the Russia probe.Transition team leader Chris Christie: Declined to call FBI Director James B. Comey and tell him that Trump liked him.Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein: Declined to do a news conference after Comeys firing saying it was his idea.Deputy national security adviser K.T.McFarland: Declined to write an internal email stating Trump hadnt told national security adviser Michael Flynn to talk during the presidential transition to the Russian ambassador about sanctions.Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats: Declined Trumps request to say there was no link between the Trump campaign and Russia.Acting Attorney General Dana Boente: According to McGahn, Boente declined Trumps request to state publicly that Trump wasnt under investigation.(Boente said he didnt recall this conversation.)Chief of Staff Reince Priebus: Declined to get Sessions to resign.Chief economic adviser Gary Cohn: Along with Porter, prevented Trump from pulling out of trade deals by pulling papers off his desk.Chief of Staff John F. Kelly: Along with Cohn, declined to lobby the Justice Department to prevent the AT&T-Time Warner merger.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis: Declined Trumps request to assassinate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Mattis: Declined Trumps request to provide military options for Iran.Unnamed officials: Ignored Trumps directive to not endorse an agreement reached at the G-7 Summit.Thats at least 15 instances of people declining to carry out significant requests from Trump ones that involved war, people who needed to be independent of the White House and also misleading or false public statements about issues of importance.Among those reportedly ignoring Trump have been two chiefs of staff, a defense secretary (twice), other top Cabinet officials and two people who were at the time overseeing the Russia investigation.
The case for and against impeachment:::::Democrats have a decision to make in the wake of the Mueller report: whether to consider impeaching President Trump over it.Its an enormously consequential decision that, in the worst-case scenario, could stain House Democrats as the lawmakers who had a chance but didnt forcefully act after a special counsel report found the president may have broken the law.But going after impeachment could also cost Democrats the 2020 presidential election.I think what we are going to have to decide as a caucus is: What is the best thing for the country?House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday on ABC Newss This Week.As Democrats spend the next few weeks debating their course of action after last weeks release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs report into Russian election interference, here are the arguments they are probably considering.The case for impeachment: Send a message to the next president that Trump-like behavior is not okay No one expects Congress to impeach Trump.That would require a sizable number of Republicans to be on board with the idea, and very few have even criticized the presidents actions as outlined in the Mueller report, let alone said it merits his ouster.But this camp argues that Congress should still go through the motions of impeachment to demonstrate to the next president that if you behave the way Trump did lying to the American people, indifferent or even hostile about the rule of law you will face consequences.Congress failure to impeach would set a dangerous precedent and imperil the nation as it would vest too much power in the executive branch and embolden future officeholders to further debase the U.S. presidency, if thats even possible, House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said in a statement after the Mueller report came out.Rep. Norma J. Torres (D-Calif.) told Politico that the Mueller report changed her mind about impeachment.She said she now absolutely believes that the president obstructed justice, which neatly fits the definition of high crimes and misdemeanors the bar for impeachment.These lawmakers appear to be the minority voice in their party, but four legal experts with whom The Fix spoke also say that Congress must do something for historys sake.If the precedent created by the Trump investigation is that a president can fire a special counsel investigating a president, then the Rule of Law is doomed, Jens David Ohlin, the vice dean of Cornell Law School, said in a statement.The case against impeachment: The political costs for Democrats are too high If the case for impeachment is a moral and legal one, the case against impeachment is a political one.Trying to get Trump out of office via the halls of Congress could directly undermine Democrats more realistic efforts to unseat him at the ballot box in 2020.Impeachment may play well with the liberal base.(Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Julin Castro have called for Congress to consider it.)But theres plenty of evidence that the rest of the country may view impeachment as an overreach.In a Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted last month, before the release of the Mueller report, half of the U.S. adults surveyed said the report will make no difference in whom they vote for president.Republicans, who are trying to win back control of the full Congress next year, feel on solid political ground backing up Trumps talking points that he did nothing wrong.A majority of the 40 pickups for House Democrats in the 2018 midterms came in more moderate districts, places such as Kansas and Oklahoma and New Mexico.Those voters, theorize Democratic leaders, are more worried about health-care costs and jobs than enforcing theoretical constitutional checks and balances for future presidents."Hes just not worth it, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told The Washington Post in March.Instead, she has urged her vulnerable Democrats to focus on kitchen-table issues.Like a jackhammer: lower health-care costs, bigger paychecks, cleaner government, she said recently.Her calculation appears to remain the same even after the Mueller reports release.The Washington Posts Karoun Demirjian and Rachael Bade report that Democratic leaders handed out talking points after the report that did not once mention the word impeachment.The case for pursuing Mueller report spinoffs: Its better than nothing This camp argues that there are ways other than impeachment proceedings to damage the president.House Democrats have launched half a dozen investigations into Trump that could be damaging to him.Democrats seem likely to fold the Mueller report into those investigations, which would help highlight it via high-profile hearings involving Attorney General William P. Barr and Mueller.But the pro-impeachers argue that its not clear what new information Congress could get about Trump and potential obstruction-of-justice actions he took via spinoff inquiries stemming from the Mueller report.Expect any interview Mueller gives to hew closely, even exactly, to the report, said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola University.Plus, Mueller had nearly two years to conduct his investigation.Congress has 18 months until the next election and a host of other jobs to do.It risks running out of time to conduct an investigation as legally and politically delicate as this.Every action carries with it risks, some more long-term than others.Democrats need to decide which risk they can live with the most, and it appears to be a very tough decision.
The Trump team still maintains Trump didn’t try to fire Mueller. Mueller disagrees.:::::President Trump and his aides are playing an interesting game with the Mueller report.They are claiming it as complete exoneration but also attempting to poke holes in its foundations and some of its details.And now, theyre going after its characterization of one of the biggest events in the obstruction probe: Trumps attempt to fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.Mueller, though, doesnt seem to harbor any doubt that it happened.In interviews Sunday and Monday, Trump legal spokesman Rudolph W. Giuliani and former Trump lawyer John Dowd both cast doubt upon former White House counsel Donald McGahns recollection of this.The argument put forth by Giuliani and Dowd is that Trump wasnt as direct about his request as McGahn seemed to believe.I think the president simply wanted McGahn to call [Deputy Attorney General Rod J.]Rosenstein and have [Mueller] vetted, Dowd told Fox News on Monday morning.He added: The president was entitled to do that.On the Sunday shows, Giuliani accused McGahn of giving competing accounts of the attempt to fire Mueller and his own threat to resign over it.He said he wasnt calling McGahn a liar, but that he was confused.The first version of that conversation is the president used the word fire, and he told the president Im going to resign directly, Giuliani told Foxs Chris Wallace.He then recants that and says no fire, no statement that I was going to resign.And then he comes up with ...a third version which is even softer which says something like, He should be fired or 'He has conflicts; he cant be special prosecutor.Giuliani added on CNN: "'He shouldnt be special counsel means its wrong that hes special counsel.It doesnt say any specific action.Its not clear what Giuliani is referring to when he references the three different versions, but he seems to be talking about the initial reporting on the event.The New York Times broke the story, saying Trump had ordered the firing of Mueller but that he ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign.The Washington Post then confirmed those basic details but added that McGahn hadnt directly informed Trump of his threat to resign.Its worth emphasizing, though, that the Times never actually said McGahn had directly informed Trump.There is no evidence that McGahn, if he was a source for these stories, actually changed his account.The Mueller report addresses this issue, saying that The Post story clarified the Timess story not that it corrected it.In that respect, the Post story clarified the Times story, which could be read to suggest that McGahn had told the President of his intention to quit, causing the President to back down from the order to have the Special Counsel fired, the report says.As for McGahns supposed third version of events the one he gave to Mueller its rather unequivocal and consistent.A sampling: McGahn said Trump said something on their first phone call to the effect of You gotta do this.You gotta call Rod.On their second call, McGahn said Trump told him, Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and cant be the Special Counsel, and Mueller has to go, and Call me back when you do it.When Trumps personal lawyer reached out to get McGahn to knock down the Timess story, McGahn declined and his attorney informed the Presidents personal counsel that the Times story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel removed.Trump then tried again, asking staff secretary Rob Porter to get McGahn to write a letter to create an internal record denying the Times story.McGahn again declined.McGahn shrugged off the request, explaining that the media reports were true.McGahn told Porter that the President had been insistent on firing the Special Counsel and that McGahn had planned to resign rather than carry out the order, although he had not personally told the President he intended to quit.In a later in-person meeting, Trump again pressed McGahn.According to the report, McGahn again said the central premise of the story was accurate.The President asked McGahn, Did I say the word fire?McGahn responded, What you said is, Call Rod [Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and cant be the Special Counsel.The President responded, I never said that.The President said he merely wanted McGahn to raise the conflicts issue with Rosenstein and leave it to him to decide what to do.McGahn told the President he did not understand the conversation that way and instead had heard, Call Rod.There are conflicts.Mueller has to go."So right there are three instances in which McGahn had his recollection of Trumps request questioned, all of them in private and under lots of pressure from the president.And in each one, he stands by his statements that Trump sought to have Mueller fired.The Mueller report itself acknowledges that this is a point that is disputed between the Trump team and McGahn, but it argues that McGahns version is compelling (key parts bolded): Some of the Presidents specific language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with [Trumps] explanation.Substantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went further and in fact directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed.First, McGahns clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein not only that conflicts existed but also that Mueller has to go.McGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the Presidents request.In response to that request, McGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin to the Saturday Night Massacre.... Third, the Presidents sense of urgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take immediate action on a weekend You gotta do this.You gotta call Rod.support McGahns recollection that the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel.Had the President instead sought only to have the Department of Justice re-examine asserted conflicts to evaluate whether they posed an ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to set the process in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated calls to McGahn.Finally, the President had discussed knocking out Mueller and raised conflicts of interest in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan to remove the Special Counsel.And in the days leading up ta June 17, 2017, the President made clear to [Reince] Priebus and [Stephen K.] Bannon, who then told [Christopher] Ruddy, that the President was considering terminating the Special Counsel.Also during this time period, the President reached out to [Chris] Christie to get his thoughts on firing the Special Counsel.This evidence shows that the President was not just seeking an examination of whether conflicts existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a way to terminate the Special Counsel.In the end, Mueller was apparently confident enough to believe McGahns memory was accurate.At one point, the report even states flatly, On Saturday, June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn and directed him to have the Special Counsel removed.It seems the Trump team isnt finished litigating that point, but Mueller is.
Supreme Court to decide whether gay, transgender workers are protected by anti-discrimination laws:::::Aimee Stephens at her home in Michigan.The Supreme Court said Monday it will take up the question of whether gay and transgender workers are protected by a federal law that bars discrimination in the workplace.(Charles William Kelly/AFP/Getty Images) The Supreme Court will deliver election-year rulings on one of the nations most consequential and unsettled civil rights issues: whether federal anti-discrimination laws prevent employers from firing workers because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.The justices announced Monday that they accepted three cases involving gay and transgender employees for the term that will begin in October.The issue has percolated for years in lower courts, and the justices spent months deciding whether now was the time to review those rulings.Its sure to be one of the new dockets most controversial topics, raising the profiles of the Supreme Court and gay rights as Democrats challenge President Trump for the White House.The cases involve a transgender funeral home director who won her case after being terminated; a gay skydiving instructor who successfully challenged his firing; and a social worker who was unable to convince a court that he was unlawfully dismissed because of his sexual orientation.[Supreme Court maintains its low-key term, while signaling an appetite for future controversies] All share a common question: whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which forbids discrimination on the basis of sex, is broad enough to encompass discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.They will be the Supreme Courts first major gay rights cases without Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who was the deciding vote and wrote the majority opinions in all of the landmark victories for gay rights, including the right to marriage in 2015s Obergefell v. Hodges.Kennedys replacement is Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, a Trump nominee who, generally, is thought to be more conservative than Kennedy but whose judicial record on gay rights is undeveloped.The Trump administration is likely to side with employers in the case, having previously disagreed with the Obama administrations position that the law prohibits discrimination against gay and transgender workers.Trump officials have reversed guidance to public school systems that they must accommodate transgender students regarding which restrooms they may use.Similarly, Trump has restricted military service by transgender women and men, a barrier the Pentagon had lifted at President Barack Obamas direction.[Trump administration rolls back protections for transgender students] LBGT advocates say polls show Americans are surprised to learn that employment protection is not among the rights won by gay and transgender Americans, especially after the victory on same-sex marriage.But only 22 states and the District of Columbia have laws expressly providing protection, according to the American Civil Liberties Union.About half of gay Americans live in those states, the organization said.Opponents of court-mandated protections said such decisions should be made by elected officials and that Congress did not have transgender and gay Americans in mind decades ago when it prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex.But the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and some appeals courts have said the protection in the law is broad.For instance, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit said it was analytically impossible not to take into account a persons sex when deciding whether to fire him or her for being transgender.Discrimination because of sex inherently includes discrimination against employees because of a change in their sex, the court ruled.Overturning such rulings would be disastrous, relegating LGBTQ people around the country to a second-class citizen status, said James Esseks, director of the ACLUs LGBT and HIV Project.The LGBTQ community has fought too long and too hard to go back now, and we are counting on the justices not to reverse that hard-won progress.The 6th Circuit was considering the case of Aimee Stephens, who had worked for R.G.and G.R.Harris Funeral Homes for six years as Anthony Stephens.At the end of my vacation on August 26, 2013, I will return to work as my true self, Amiee [sic] Australia Stephens, in appropriate business attire, Stephens wrote to co-workers.But two weeks later, the companys owner, Thomas Rost, fired Stephens.Rost acknowledged firing Stephens because he was no longer going to represent himself as a man.He wanted to dress as a woman.Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal group, is defending Rost.Neither government agencies nor the courts have authority to rewrite federal law by replacing sex with gender identity a change with widespread consequences for everyone, senior counsel John Bursch said in a statement.Businesses have the right to rely on what the law is not what government agencies want it to be when they create and enforce employment policies.The funeral home wants to serve families mourning the loss of a loved one, but the EEOC has elevated its political goals above the interests of the grieving people that the funeral home serves, Bursch said.Stephenss lawyers noted that the 6th Circuit had an alternative reason for ruling for their client: a 1989 Supreme Court decision that said it was illegal to discriminate against workers because they did not conform to gender stereotypes.The court accepted two cases involving sexual orientation, which will be argued together.[Employers cant discriminate based on sexual orientation, court says, dealing loss to Trump administration] One involved Donald Zarda, a gay skydiving instructor.Zarda jokingly told a woman who was going to be strapped to him for a dive not to worry because he was gay.But she and her boyfriend later complained that Zarda had touched her inappropriately.The company, Altitude Express, dismissed him, and Zarda sued.Zarda died in a 2014 base-jumping accident, and his case was pursued by his sister and a former partner.There were questions about whether the now-dissolved company for which he worked could be held liable.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit did rule, though, that the anti-discrimination law protected Zarda.Sexual orientation discrimination is a subset of sex discrimination because sexual orientation is defined by ones sex in relation to the sex of those to whom one is attracted, it ruled last year.I couldnt believe you could be fired for being gay, Melissa Zarda, Donald Zardas sister, said in a telephone conference call.I thought this has to be against the law, and it is against the law.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in 2018 ruled the other way, in a short order based on circuit precedent.It ruled against Gerald Lynn Bostock, who said he was fired from his job as a social worker after his employers discovered that he was gay.Officials in Clayton County, Ga., said that Bostocks firing had nothing to do with his sexual orientation.The cases are Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga.; Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, and R.G.and G.R.Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. EEOC.
House Democratic leaders say no immediate plans to open impeachment proceedings against Trump:::::U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), Irish Education Minister Joe McHugh, U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.)and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) cross the Irish border from Northern Ireland into the Republic of Ireland at Bridgened in County Donegal on Thursday.(Niall Carson/AP) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told lawmakers Monday that there are no plans to immediately open impeachment proceedings against President Trump, rejecting calls from several Democrats to initiate steps to try to oust the president.In a rare Monday night conference call, the California Democrat stressed that the near-term strategy in the wake of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs report is to focus on investigating the president and seeing where the inquiries lead.Members of Pelosis leadership team reaffirmed her cautious approach, according to four officials on the call who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.We have to save our democracy.This isnt about Democrats or Republicans.Its about saving our democracy, Pelosi said.But Pelosis message did not go over well with several Democrats, who argued that Congress has a duty to hold Trump to account with impeachment despite the political blowback Pelosi has long feared.Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a member of the House Judiciary Committee, argued that as someone with more than 25 years of experience in law enforcement, she thought the House had enough evidence to proceed.While I understand we need to see the full report and all supporting documents, I believe we have enough evidence now, Demings said.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said the party has a duty to openly discuss the downside of not impeaching Trump for his actions and the precedent it could set for the future.Mueller, in the 448-page redacted report released last week, identified 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Trump but he did not find that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.The report has divided Democrats, with several clamoring for impeachment, notably White House candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), while others argue such a step is futile with the GOP controlling the Senate.Several Democrats maintain that impeachment would embolden Trump and his Republican backers ahead of the 2020 election.Despite leaderships effort to tamp down impeachment talk, they did not rule it out completely.In fact, after some of her members spoke up, Pelosi clarified that if it is what we need to do to honor our responsibility to the Constitution if thats the place the facts take us, thats the place we have to go.I wish you would just read my letter because it, I think succinctly, presents some of the reasons, I think whether its articles of impeachment or investigations, its the same obtaining of facts, she said to her members.We dont have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts, the presentation of facts.The nearly 90-minute call with lawmakers scattered around the country during the congressional recess came just hours after Pelosi appeared to tap the brakes on impeachment discussions.She argued in a letter to her colleagues that while Democrats would hold Trump accountable for his actions in the Mueller report, it is ...important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings.Whether currently indictable or not, it is clear that the president has, at a minimum, engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior which does not bring honor to the office he holds, Pelosi wrote.[After Mueller report, Democrats divided over end game investigate Trump or impeach] She added: As we proceed to uncover the truth and present additional needed reforms to protect our democracy, we must show the American people we are proceeding free from passion or prejudice, strictly on the presentation of fact.The speakers caution comes despite an impeachment push by some 2020 presidential hopefuls and even some of her Democratic chairmen, who suggested on the Sunday talk shows that it might be an option.But as they briefed lawmakers on the call Monday night, those same chairmen appeared to push that notion to the side for now, suggesting Democratic leaders who spoke privately before the call have decided it is not the time to start such proceeding.Even House Financial Services Chairman Maxine Waters, who last week warned that Congresss failure to impeach is complacency in the face of the erosion of our democracy and constitutional norms, did not push the matter.Instead, the California Democrat, a vocal Trump critic who is probing the presidents business practices before he won the 2016 election, made a point on the call of clarifying that she is not pressuring lawmakers to join her effort.Waters instead spoke of her latest effort to subpoena a bank that lent money to Trump despite his bankruptcies.Just minutes before the call, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) subpoenaed former White House counsel Donald McGahn, who was a central witness in Muellers probe into possible obstruction of justice by Trump.Nadler also spoke on the call about his own next steps in investigating Trump.According to an official on the call, leadership tried to emphasize that impeachment is not a political decision and that they would let the chairmen do what they need to keep investigating Trump.But Rep. Alcee L. Hastings (D-Fla.) challenged that assertion, telling leadership not to shy away from the notion that impeachment isnt political.It is political, he retorted.But leadership had allies.Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), the leader of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, said he was committed to ensuring Trump doesnt get reelected but also wondered if the party would guarantee the Republicans second term with an impeachment push.Himes asked for impeachment data from leaders so Democrats knew where the country was on the issue.Rep. Stephen F. Lynch (D-Mass.)agreed.According to a recent survey, roughly 6 in 10 Democrats said Congress should begin impeachment hearings in a Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted after Attorney General William P. Barrs initial letter to Congress about the investigations findings but before the release of the final report.But the same survey found the public overall leaned against impeaching Trump, with 41 percent saying Congress should begin hearings and 54 percent saying lawmakers should not.At one point on the call, a lawmaker brought up a question about whether House Democrats could censure the president.Nadler explained how it has no legal effect but would just be a simple expression of disapproval.Nadler said it was an option, though did not endorse it explicitly.Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), one of the most liberal members in leadership, said no option, including impeachment, should be taken off the table.She asked leadership to give lawmakers messaging about how House Democrats can both push for economic issues they ran on while also holding up the rule of law by checking Trump.Despite Democratic leaderships move to down play the prospects of impeachment at this time, they did not rule it out completely.Officials following the House probes closely say thats intentional.Should Pelosi declare no impeachment flat out, she probably would undercut her chairmens bid to sue the Trump administration for the full Mueller report, including grand jury information.To get those documents, impeachment probably would have to be on the table, lawyers say, justifying the House move to get such information.Pelosi would also risk the ire of the far left, which has typically viewed her as an ally of their cause.Before the Mueller report, Pelosi had argued that impeachment was too divisive, politically costly and that Trump was not worth it.Pelosi also set a high threshold for taking up impeachment, arguing it would have to be bipartisan.But after the Mueller reports release, Republicans have largely gone silent, even as Mueller detailed the Trump campaign welcoming Russias interference in the 2016 election and Trumps effort to thwart the investigation.Mueller, however, did not establish conspiracy and did not answer the question of whether Trump obstructed justice, appearing to kick the issue to Congress.Barr said the president did not obstruct justice.Republicans control the Senate, and even if the Democratic-led House voted to impeach Trump, it would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict the president and remove him from office.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Monday dismissed the notion of impeachment.Well, look, I think its time to move on.This investigation was about collusion, theres no collusion, no charges brought against the president on anything else, and I think the American people have had quite enough of it, McConnell said when questioned during a stop in Owensboro, Ky. [Democrats will meet in the next few weeks to discuss impeachment, Schiff says] Pelosi in her Monday letter took a shot at the GOP for its muted reaction to the Mueller report.It is also clear that the congressional Republicans have an unlimited appetite for such low standards, she wrote.The GOP should be ashamed of what the Mueller report has revealed, instead of giving the president their blessings.Pelosi also called on the GOP-controlled Senate to take up campaign finance legislation that passed the House earlier this year, which included sweeping ethics changes.On Sunday, the presidents legal team argued that it was acceptable for the Trump campaign to seek to benefit from Russias hacking of the Clinton campaign.[I]n light of the Presidents defenders arguing in defense of receiving and weaponizing stolen emails, we continue to press our Republican House counterparts to take up our pledge to refuse to use stolen, hacked, or falsified information in campaigns because the American people deserve honest debate, Pelosi wrote.Meanwhile, White House officials taunted House Democrats as they considered their next steps.If they have to get a conference call together to figure out where theyre going from here, they shouldnt be in office in the first place, said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Fox and Friends.I think its quite sad that theyve got to have a conference call with all of their members to figure out what theyre going to do with themselves now that the Mueller report is out and proven that there was no collusion and no obstruction.John Wagner and Scott Clement contributed to this report.Read more at PowerPost
Constraints on presidency being redefined in Trump era, report fallout shows:::::President Trump repeatedly tried to undermine the Russia investigation, but the special counsel overseeing the probe declined to say whether he broke the law and the attorney general declared that he had committed no crime.Trumps campaign showed a willingness to work with a foreign power something his personal lawyer now insists is perfectly okay.And Trump has furiously rejected congressional scrutiny of his presidency taking the unprecedented step Monday of suing a Democratic committee chairman to block a subpoena for his financial records.The events of the past week, following the release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs dramatic 448-page report, are threatening to redefine the legal and ethical standards that have long served as constraints on the American presidency.And they suggest that few, if any, of the traditional guardrails that have kept Trumps predecessors in check remain for this president and possibly those who will follow him.The most disturbing part of the picture thats been drawn about norms is, there is now a crumbling consensus about what they are, said Bob Bauer, White House counsel under President Barack Obama.The Republican defense of Trump has muddied the congressional response, so it now appears that even a president who is a chronic liar, who tried to obstruct justice, who instructed his White House counsel to fabricate evidence, has not apparently conducted himself in a way that everybody can agree violates the norms.Democrats had hoped that Muellers investigation into Russias interference in the 2016 election would serve as a check on what they view as Trumps rampant abuse of power.But Muellers team found there was no conspiracy between Moscow and the campaign while concluding that it could not render a judgment on whether Trump criminally obstructed justice because of government guidelines about indicting a sitting president.This left an emboldened Trump to proclaim complete and total EXONERATION despite the reports numerous details of the presidents efforts to end or stymie Muellers investigation.Trumps aides and supporters have brushed off the details in Muellers report that show the president tried to stop or stymie the special counsels investigation, with even Attorney General William P. Barr describing Trumps actions as understandable given his anger over the probe.They have portrayed Democrats as sore losers for refusing to accept that Mueller did not declare Trump had committed any crimes.But the aftermath of Muellers report, as well as Congresss overall inability to help serve as a check on Trump, has potentially created a precedent in which it remains unclear where the current lines are on presidential behavior.Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI assistant director, said that the combination of an attorney general who comes at this from a legal philosophy of very broad executive powers and a president who is more interested in an imperial presidency has created a troubling dynamic where we may have three equal branches of government but one branch the executive one is more equal than the others.Nick Akerman, a former federal prosecutor who served as a member of the Watergate prosecution team, also criticized Barr for stepping in to declare no crime had been committed when Muellers report seemed to leave this decision up to Congress.Its problematic because youve got a renegade attorney general whos basically doing everything he can to twist the law, to make it sound like what Trump did is not a crime, Akerman said.It makes it a lot harder for somebody else, after Trump leaves office, to prosecute him based on the facts Mueller has found that he obstructed justice.On Sunday, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani seemed to further define downward acceptable presidential conduct, telling CNNs State of the Union that theres nothing wrong with taking information from Russians a government the intelligence community and Mueller have concluded interfered in the election to sow discord in the United States.He said the issue was not one of immorality, arguing that nearly every presidential campaign in history has engaged in some sort of immoral or unethical behavior.But, he added, he personally would have advised against accepting information from the Russians, just out of an excess of caution.The repercussions of Muellers report, as well as the unabashed victory lap by Trump and his allies, have created a particular conundrum for Democrats, who are still grappling with the politically fraught question of whether to move forward with impeachment proceedings that are almost certain to die in the Republican-controlled Senate.Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts was the first major Democratic presidential candidate to call for Trumps impeachment, in a series of Twitter posts on Friday.To ignore a Presidents repeated efforts to obstruct an investigation into his own disloyal behavior would inflict great and lasting damage on this country, and it would suggest that both the current and future Presidents would be free to abuse their power in similar ways, she wrote.But Democrats generally remain mixed on how to proceed.Many are reluctant to waste political capital on a mission impeaching Trump they think has little chance for success.But they are also mindful that by not condemning the presidents behavior, they may be seen as tacitly condoning it and helping lower the standards for future occupants of the Oval Office.I think even if we did not win, possibly, if there were not impeachment, I think history would smile upon us for standing up for the Constitution, House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.)said Sunday on CBSs Face The Nation, while noting he was not yet ready to begin impeachment proceedings.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told her members Monday night that leaders had no immediate plans to open impeachment proceedings but would continue to investigate Trump, according to officials on the conference call.White House aides said they think the report will cause little long-term political damage because most of the damaging stories were already known and that even some of the presidents most ardent supporters do not view him as a paragon of morality.Several advisers added that they expect Muellers conclusions to cost Trump few votes.I dont think there was a whole lot of information that was new that had not been reported on previously or discussed in a public setting, said Raj Shah, a former White House spokesman who now advises the campaign.It almost seemed like the summary of the last two years of the public debate.I dont think this report gives any momentum to those who want to see the president impeached.Shah added that Trump voters are unlikely to punish the president for fighting back against Muellers probe.The broad notion that the president was disgruntled with and unhappy with an investigation targeting his legitimacy out of the gate they afford him the right to be upset about it, he said.Muellers finding that there was no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia has now become a key talking point heading into Trumps reelection bid, with his political apparatus planning to target both the investigators and the news media that covered the investigation.Trump has told White House aides that they should expect continued subpoenas and calls for testimony on Capitol Hill, and that he hopes to use that to portray the Democrats as overzealous partisans.And, unlike during Muellers investigation, the president is unlikely to allow all of his current and former aides to testify publicly, according to White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.The White House has already made clear that it plans to fight nearly every request for documents and testimony from Democratic committees, and a senior White House official said the report allows the administration to be more emboldened in pushing back against House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and other congressional investigators.Current and former aides say they do not expect Trump to change his behavior, saying he is unlikely to be responsive to anything other than political pain in the form of a real revolt by Republican leadership or a sharp drop in poll numbers.George Conway, a Republican lawyer and frequent Trump critic who is married to one of the presidents senior advisers, said that Trump may soon feel political repercussions, arguing he should be performing better in public opinion polls given the strength of the economy.Everybody knows that there is not this overwhelming urge and supermajority of public support to remove this guy from office, Conway said.He is his own worst enemy.Hes the reason hes not at 50 or 55 percent-plus with the economy going the way it is.That tells you something about how damaging this has been to him.Trump was showing no signs of backing down on Monday.Asked at the White House Easter Egg Roll whether he was worried about impeachment, he replied, Not even a little bit.And pressed on the portrait that emerges in the Mueller report, of White House aides disregarding his directives and at times working to scuttle his most dangerous impulses, the president was adamant.Nobody disobeys my orders, Trump said.
Trump eyes action against countries with high visa-overstay rates:::::President Trump wants to reduce the number of foreign nationals who overstay their visas.(Alex Brandon/AP) President Trump is directing the secretaries of state and homeland security to find ways to combat visa overstays, setting a deadline of the end of the summer for next steps on the issue.Immigrant rights advocates warned that the memorandum issued by Trump on Monday could lead to action with broad implications for legal immigration.Similar to the executive orders from the first days of the Trump administration, this order lays the groundwork for significant policy changes ...that continue to curb legal immigration and further expand enforcement operations, Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said in a statement.The Wall Street Journal first reported earlier this month that Trump was considering the move.In its statement announcing the move, the White House said recommendations from the Departments of State and Homeland Security on limiting nonimmigrant visa overstays are due within 120 days.One step under consideration, according to the White House, is the suspension or restriction of entry for individuals from countries with high overstay rates.The rampant problem of visa overstays is undermining the rule of law and straining resources that are needed to address the crisis at our southern border, the statement reads.The move is aimed at countries with visa overstay rates of higher than 10 percent a figure that applies to 20 countries as well as those participating in the Visa Waiver Program.Immigration attorney David Leopold said the memorandum looks like a first step toward a future plan to ban visitors from certain African countries with high overstay rates.Several nations in Africa are among those with double-digit overstay rates, according to 2017 Department of Homeland Security figures.Leopold, a past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, called the move a waste of resources, noting that U.S. immigration law already imposes bans of up to 10 years on those who overstay tourist or visitor visas for more than six months.In addition, U.S. consular officers have discretion to deny visas to applicants at a higher risk of overstay, he said.
House Democrats issue subpoena for former White House lawyer McGahn:::::The Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena Monday ordering former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify before the panel next month and hand over documents and records pertaining to federal investigations of President Trump, his finances, his campaign, and charges that he sought to obstruct justice.The special counsels report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses, Judiciary panel chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said in a statement, calling McGahn a critical witness to many of the allege instances of obstruction of justice and other misconduct described in the Mueller report.His testimony will help shed further light on the presidents attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others do the same, Nadler continued.McGahn is the first former White House employee to receive a subpoena for congressional testimony in the wake of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs redacted report being released to the public.Last week, the Judiciary Committee also issued a subpoena for the full report, absent redactions, to the Justice Department; the panel has also prepared subpoenas for other former White House officials, including former communications director Hope Hicks.According to the subpoena, Nadler wants McGahn to produce the requested documents and records by May 7, and testify before the panel May 21.[Trump asked his lawyer to cross legal lines.The Mueller report shows how he pushed back.]McGahn emerged as a key witness in Muellers 448-page report, detailing several occasions when Trump ordered him to do crazy shit, according to the special counsels findings such as convince the Justice Department to get rid of Mueller.McGahn didnt, and almost resigned over the episode.He also refused to issue a public statement denying the reports Trump wanted to fire Mueller were true when the president asked him to.McGahn also told the special counsel about how Trump sought to prevent former attorney general Jeff Sessions from recusing himself from oversight of Muellers probe.In that case, McGahn did communicate the presidents desires to Sessions, who decided to recuse himself anyway.The former White House lawyers testimony fits into what emerges as a pattern of behavior by Trump, depicted across the pages of Muellers report, in which he frequently ordered subordinates to lie or take steps that would have run afoul of the law.But the report also makes clear that those subordinates chose not to heed his demands.The fact that White House employees did not follow his more questionable orders may have saved the president from more legal jeopardy on matters of potential obstruction of justice.But the disclosure of that pattern nonetheless angered Trump, who told reporters Monday: Nobody disobeys my orders.Since the reports release, Trump has also taken particular aim at McGahn for taking notes during their meetings.In the report, McGahn recalled how Trump told him that lawyers dont take notes recalling how previous lawyers, such as Roy Cohn, had never taken notes during meetings with Trump.McGahn responded by assuring Trump that a real lawyer like himself did take notes.Cohn, a onetime mentor and fixer for Trump, was eventually disbarred.On Sunday, Trump lashed out at McGahns notetaking again, this time on Twitter.Watch out for people that take so-called notes, when the notes never existed until needed, Trump tweeted, in a string of tweets in which he referred to many of the statements in the Mueller report as total bullshit.Read more at PowerPost
Trump sues in bid to block congressional subpoena of financial records:::::President Trump sued his own accounting firm and the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight Committee at the same time Monday trying an unusual tactic to stop the firm from giving the committee details about Trumps past financial dealings.The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the District of Columbia, seeks a court order to quash a subpoena issued last week by the committee to Mazars USA.Trumps lawyers also are asking a federal judge to temporarily block the subpoena until the court has had a chance to review their request.The move amounts to Trump the leader of the executive branch of government asking the judicial branch to stop the legislative branch from investigating his past.Former House counsels from both sides of the aisle called the challenge a long shot and an apparent delay tactic.The suit came as House Democrats issued another subpoena likely to touch a nerve for the president.The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee on Monday ordered former White House counsel Donald McGahn to testify before the panel next month and hand over documents and records pertaining to federal investigations of Trump, his finances, his campaign and allegations he sought to obstruct justice.He is the first former White House employee to receive a subpoena for congressional testimony in the wake of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs redacted report being released to the public.Over the years, Congress has had broad leeway to use its subpoena power to probe possible corruption in other branches of government.For instance, during the 1990s the GOP-led House spent years investigating President Bill Clintons involvement in the Whitewater scandal, which began long before he was elected.Trumps lawsuit seeks to upend decades of legal precedent that have upheld Congresss right to investigate, arguing that his past personal dealings are irrelevant to the legislative branchs fundamental job: writing bills.There is no possible legislation at the end of this tunnel, Trumps attorneys wrote in their brief, talking about the Oversight Committees inquiry into whether Trump misled his lenders by inflating his net worth.The Oversight Committee is instead assuming the powers of the Department of Justice, investigating (dubious and partisan) allegations of illegal conduct by private individuals.The subpoena Trump is seeking to stop sent by Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.)relates in part to Statements of Financial Condition that Mazars produced for Trump before he took office.These statements are unaudited summations of Trumps assets, debts and net worth, which Mazars compiled annually for Trump.The statements omitted some debts, overvalued some assets and misstated some key facts in ways that made Trump seem wealthier than he was.[Read Trumps complaint against the House Oversight Committee] In testimony this year, Trumps former lawyer Michael Cohen said that Trump used these statements to solicit loans from banks, including for a failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills.Cohen said Trump also had used the statements to persuade insurers to lower his premiums.At the time of that testimony, Cohen already had pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in earlier testimony, when he was still working for Trump.He is now facing a three-year jail term.The Oversight Committee on March 20 asked the company for copies of statements of financial condition and audits prepared for Trump and several of his companies, including the one that owns the Trump International Hotel in downtown Washington.The panel also requested supporting documents used to produce the reports and communications between the firm and Trump.In a statement, Cummings called Trumps suit baseless.There is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress, Cummings said.This complaint reads more like political talking points than a reasoned legal brief.A spokeswoman for Mazars confirmed that the company had received the lawsuit Monday.As a firm we will respect this process and will comply with all legal obligations, spokeswoman Jennifer Farrington said.She said corporate policy barred her from commenting further.Trumps lawsuit argues that Mazars should follow the code of professional conduct issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.It quotes one section that counsels CPAs against disclos[ing] any confidential client information without the specific consent of the client.The next paragraph of that code, however, says that CPAs can release client information to comply with a validly issued and enforceable subpoena.Trumps private attorney, Jay Sekulow, issued a brief statement saying, We will not allow Congressional Presidential harassment to go unanswered.In the suit, Trumps attorneys wrote that the true purpose of this investigation was not governance but political advantage: Its goal is to expose Plaintiffs private financial information for the sake of exposure, with the hope that it will turn up something that Democrats can use as a political tool against the President now and in the 2020 election.The Trump Organization, Trumps private business, also is listed as a plaintiff in the lawsuit.Trump still owns the business, although he says he has given up day-to-day control to his sons Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.In a phone interview, Trump Organization attorney Alan Garten called the subpoena unprecedented overreach by Congress.[Trump moves to resist House inquiries, setting up fight over congressional subpoena powers] On Monday, some legal experts were skeptical that the presidents tactic would succeed.They said courts generally have granted Congress fairly wide powers to investigate, even in cases where the investigation wasnt connected to a pending bill.You can never say never because courts change and there are new judges, but this is way over the top, said Kerry W. Kircher, who served as House counsel for the Republican majority from 2011 to 2016, referring to the suit.Im as confident as I can be that theres no chance of success here on the merits.Kircher said that the courts would be altering the whole arrangement of checks and balances should they rule in favor of Trump.In Trumps lawsuit, his attorneys cited a Supreme Court decision called Kilbourn v. Thompson, which found no express power in the Constitution for Congress to investigate individuals without pending legislation.The problem with that argument, said University of Baltimore law professor Charles Tiefer, is that Kilbourn v. Thompson is a case from 1880.And it was overruled by a decision in 1927, Tiefer said.It has not been followed for the last 90 years, Tiefer said of the 1880 decision.Instead, the 1927 ruling found Congress has much wider powers to investigate and courts since then have let that interpretation stand and even reinforced it.Tiefer, a Democrat and former acting House counsel, said the main goal of Trumps team may be not to block the subpoena forever but simply to delay it so any damaging information comes out after the 2020 election.But he said the case could actually move through the courts quickly perhaps in just a few months.By reaching back to precedent to the 1880s, theyre seeking ...to overturn the entire modern case law that the courts have put together to respect Congresss investigative power, he said of Trumps lawyers.Its a very long shot....These suits look like an act of desperation by the Trump lawyers.Mondays lawsuit comes amid a broader effort by Trumps attorneys and the White House to resist congressional requests for information.This month, the Treasury Department missed a deadline to hand over Trumps tax returns to the House Ways and Means Committee.White House officials also have been digging in their heels on other requests related to Trumps actions as president.The administration has signaled it does not plan to turn over information being sought about how particular individuals received their security clearances, Trumps meetings with foreign leaders and other topics that they plan to argue are subject to executive privilege, according to several aides familiar with internal discussions.On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) sent a letter to fellow Democrats that said the House was determined to conduct oversight over the other branches of government, unified in our search for the truth.While some in her party have called for the chamber to initiate impeachment proceedings, Pelosi thus far has resisted that request, instead throwing her support behind aggressive committee investigations into Trumps actions both before and after he took office.Cummingss subpoena to Mazars put a spotlight on an accounting firm that Trump has used since the early 1980s.In addition to compiling these statements of financial condition for Trump personally, Mazars and its predecessor firms also handled the tax filings for his charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation.Devlin Barrett, Karoun Demirjian and Tom Hamburger contributed to this report.
Trump Fed Board pick under fire for writing that women should not be allowed to be men’s sports referees — unless they’re good-looking:::::Stephen Moore, visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in Washington on March 22.(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg News) Stephen Moore, one of President Trump's planned nominees for the Federal Reserve Board, wrote columns decrying the feminization of basketball, denouncing coed sports and arguing that women should be barred from refereeing or covering mens basketball games unless they are good-looking.Moore also wrote that female athletes were seeking equal pay for inferior work and lamented, Is there no area in life where men can take vacation from women?The statements by Moore, made in columns he wrote for the conservative magazine National Review in the 2000s and resurfaced Monday by CNN, prompted a wave of criticism from womens rights advocates.Donald Trump thinks he can populate the U.S. government the way he picks golf partners at Mar-a-Lago, National Organization for Women President Toni Van Pelt said in a statement.He surrounds himself with sycophants and ideologues who similarly embrace his sexism, misogyny and anger.Trumps nominees do not need to be qualified so long as they praise him, pledge slavish loyalty, and share his attitudes towards women.Also criticizing Moore on Monday was sportscaster Bonnie Bernstein, who Moore had once written knows nothing about basketball but should wear a halter top.Trump announced last month that he was selecting Moore, his close ally, to fill an open seat on the Feds seven-person board.Another Trump nominee for the panel, Herman Cain, withdrew from consideration Monday.Cain, a former restaurant industry executive, had faced multiple allegations of sexual harassment as well as skepticism from some lawmakers regarding his qualifications to sit on the board of the central bank.In an email Monday afternoon, Moore dismissed his previous statements about women in sports as having been made in jest.This was not a serious article, Moore said.It was a spoof piece and its almost 20 years old.I dont stand by any of those comments today.But Moores questionable remarks were made in several columns dating from 1998 to 2003.Moore did not respond when asked to which column he was referring and whether he could explain the fact that he made disparaging comments about women in more than one article.The resurfacing of the columns is the latest debacle for Moore.Court documents show that Moore was also found in contempt of court in 2013 for failing to pay his ex-wife more than $330,000 in alimony and child support.In one of his columns for National Review, Moore decried the feminization of basketball generally and wrote that it was an obscenity that a woman was allowed to referee a mens NCAA game.Is there no area in life where men can take vacation from women?Moore wrote in the March 2002 piece.Whats next?Women invited to bachelor parties?Women in combat?(Oh yeah, theyve done that already.)Why cant women ref [the] womens games and men the mens games.He went on to propose a no women rule for mens college basketball games.No more women refs, no women announcers, no women beer venders, no women anything, Moore wrote.There is, of course, an exception to this rule.Women are permitted to participate, if and only if, they look like Bonnie Bernstein.The fact that Bonnie knows nothing about basketball is entirely irrelevant.He added that Bernstein should wear a halter top.This is a no-brainer, CBS.Bernstein, who left CBS in 2006, tweeted a response to Moore on Monday afternoon: You want halter tops?Hit the club scene.You want hoops knowledge?Try actually listening..@KFILE @StephenMoore You want halter tops?Hit the club scene.You want hoops knowledge?Try actually listening.https://t.co/HKsd4wRbQ6 Bonnie Bernstein (@BonnieBernstein) April 22, 2019 CNN noted that Moore responded to criticism of his column at the time, writing, Look, for all I care the women can use chimpanzees to ref their games.I hate womens basketball.In another piece published in June 2000, Moore wrote that male athletes should get paid more than female athletes because men are more skilled than women at sports.The women tennis pros dont really want equal pay for equal work, he wrote.They want equal pay for inferior work ...Venus Williams is a multi-millionaire not in spite of the fact that she is a women, but precisely because shes a woman.She receives much higher pay than an equally skilled man.Moore had previously argued that peewee soccer was particularly insidious because boys and girls play together.No one seems to care much that co-ed sports is doing irreparable harm to the psyche of Americas little boys.At this pre-puberty state of life girls tower over the boys and typically have greater coordination, Moore wrote in the 1998 National Review column, titled Soccer-Mom Hell.He also described a female kindergartner who stampeded over his son as Secretariat in pigtails, a reference to the Triple Crown-winning horse.Several Democrats renewed their calls Monday for Trump not to nominate Moore in the wake of the CNN report and the withdrawal of Cains nomination.Mr. Moore, like Mr. Cain, poses a danger to the economic stability of our country, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement.Mr. Cain clearly saw the writing on the wall and withdrew his name from consideration; hopefully Senate Republicans will again voice their deep concerns and force Mr. Moore to do the same.Heather Long contributed to this report.
What are the crimes Trump says his opponents committed — and who committed them?:::::President Trump at Joint Base Andrews on Sunday.(Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP) President Trump seizes on political slogans with the casual ease of a college bro trying on shirts before hitting a nightclub on the Jersey Shore.He tries them on, sees how they work and leaves a number of them in a pile on the floor.For every Make America great again, there are a half-dozen Build the wall and crime will falls cluttering up the White House residence.Since the release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs redacted report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump has developed a refined version of a sales pitch he has been making for several years now: It was the Democrats, not Trump, who did some crimes.And how could you impeach Trump when there were no Trump crimes?(As he said Monday.)How do you impeach him for crimes done by Democrats?(As he phrased it over the weekend.)We will set aside the fact that anyone can essentially be impeached for anything, that the high crimes and misdemeanors rhetoric in the Constitution means essentially whatever a majority of the House says it means.It could include the sorts of almost-crimes that Muellers report hinted at in various places.Appealing to the cool-minded rationality of members of the House to avoid being impeached seems like a risky bet, but that was Trumps sales pitch in brief.But, again: Were setting that aside.Lets instead consider the other side of that argument.What, exactly, are the crimes that the Democrats committed?This is a surprisingly difficult question to answer.It has the feel of something approximating a political argument, but any assessment of it as a serious argument falls apart quickly.It hinges significantly on a robust understanding of the parallel line of argument that has run through conservative media over the past two years, in which phrases such as insurance policy are loaded with a weight that allows whole swaths of sketchy argumentation to be summarized and quickly moved past.But picking the argument apart reveals how sketchy it is.Consider this depiction of the Real Crimes as articulated by conservative commentator Mark Levin over the weekend.A video of Levin making this case was tweeted by the president Monday and, for a time, pinned to the top of Trumps Twitter page, ensuring visitors would see it.There are things that have been done in the last thee years to candidate Trump, President-elect Trump and President Trump that should not occur in the United States of America, Levin said.Senior levels of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.These individuals should be charged.Theyre the ones who interfered in our election, even more effectively than the Russians.Whats more, Levin said, theyre still at it."They planted a spy thats right, a spy in the Trump administration, he continued.They lied to federal courts not once but four times, the FISA court, in order to get a counterintelligence warrant.And they got it.And who were they spying on?Page?It was a backdoor effort to go after the Trump campaign.You had the Hillary campaign, the Obama administration, trying to take out the Republican candidate for president of the United States, because of the preposterous idea, Levin said, that Trump was conspiring with Russian President Vladimir Putin.In some circles, this is accepted almost as a baseline of reality about how the Russia investigation came to be.But it makes little sense, just as Levins claim in March 2017 that Trump had been wiretapped indirectly spurring an infamous Trump tweet and a forceful denial from the government was similarly weak.So lets pick it apart.Levin says that senior FBI officials should face criminal charges for having interfered in our election.Theres no question that a senior FBI official did affect the election then-FBI Director James B. Comey, whose last-minute statement about the investigation into Hillary Clintons email server shifted the focus of the final days of the 2016 campaign.But theres also no question that the quiet investigation into possible coordination between Trumps campaign and Russia didnt attract much attention before Election Day despite the fact that, if those senior officials Levin disparages had wanted to, they could have released a slew of information about sketchy contacts between Trumps campaign and Russia that were already under investigation before the election occurred.They didnt.They planted a spy in the Trump administration, Levin claims, presumably meaning the Trump campaign, since the administration necessarily followed the election.Its also not true that there was a spy placed in the administration, as weve noted before.There were specific individuals, such as foreign policy advisers Carter Page (referred to by Levin) and George Papadopoulos, who came under FBI scrutiny because of their links to Russia, including, according to reports, with outreach by a confidential informant.Theres no evidence that the FBI targeted the campaign itself, which would have been one pretty direct way to spy on the campaign.As for those four lies to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (the FISC, or the FISA Court), thats conservative shorthand for the warrants to surveil Page, which were predicated to some extent on a dossier of reports compiled by British ex-intelligence officer Christopher Steele.That dossier and the Page warrants are central to the line of argument that Trump was targeted unfairly, because the dossier was work completed with funding from a law firm that worked for Clintons campaign and the Democratic Party.The warrant (and three subsequent renewals) mentioned that the dossier was probably part of an effort to find information that could be used to discredit [Trumps] campaign but not specifically that it was funded by the Democrats.Therefore, per Levin, a lie.And therefore, apparently, a crime, aimed at keeping Trump from being elected.[Why the Trump Tower meeting may have violated the law and the Steele dossier likely didnt] Levin doesnt mention that the Page warrants were first obtained after he left the campaign or that Page was already on the FBIs radar as a counterintelligence target or that Page traveled to Russia in July 2016 and held meetings there that even Muellers team couldnt fully detail in scope.Levin breezes past that, because its all taken as an article of faith in his circles that the Page FISA warrant was a mark of bias by the FBI.A key originator of this charge is Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), whose staff last year wrote a four-page memo, eventually released by Trump, to make the case of FISA warrant bias public.Again: This was not a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign it followed Pages work with the campaign but since the starting point for Trump and his allies is generally to discredit the Russia investigation broadly, they will take what they can get.Trumps recent interest in declaring the Democrats as the Real Criminals appears to match up with Nuness latest effort to muddy the water.As ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Nunes has pledged to send eight criminal referrals to the Justice Department with the hope that eight people will face criminal charges for their actions.Hes not saying who those people are, mind you, but he did offer hints.So theres five direct referrals based on lying, obstruction, congressional investigation and leaking, Nunes said in an interview on Fox News.We have a global leaks referral, which involves just a few reporters but could involve multiple people.And then you have conspiracy referrals.One is based on the manipulation of intelligence.The second one is based on FISA abuse and other matters.So thats where we stand.Nunes told Fox Newss Sean Hannity that he wouldnt identify the people but that Hannity could probably guess who some were.So Nunes probably means people such as Peter Strzok, a then-FBI agent who exchanged anti-Trump text messages with a colleague while working on investigations linked to Trump, including the Russian-interference probe.(He was removed from Muellers team a few weeks after Mueller was appointed when the texts came to light.)He probably means former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who became a target of Trumps even before the election.He was fired last year for allegedly misleading investigators about a conversation he had with a reporter that, ironically, had the effect of drawing negative attention to Clinton.At the end there you see that Nunes mentioned FISA abuse, again a referral to the Page thing.Now we overlay another complication: Many of the people Nunes and the conservative media have targeted arent Democrats.McCabe was a Republican during the period at issue, for example, as was Comey.Nuness eight referrals (which, by the way, the Justice Department can essentially ignore) might include former intelligence officials targeted by Trump, such as former CIA director Michael Hayden, who is an independent.There have been other, public criminal referrals.Early last year, Sens.Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) referred Steele, the dossier author, to the Justice Department for allegedly lying to Congress.House Republicans similarly referred Trumps former personal attorney Michael Cohen for the same alleged infraction.But, again, those relate to things that happened after Trump took office.In summary, its worth remembering this about Trumps claims that his opponents broke the law: He doesnt say who those opponents are, and he doesnt say what laws they allegedly broke or when.He uses the allegation itself as a bookmark for all of the conspiracy theories above.If you accept this year-long narrative about Strzok and Page and so on, then you dont need any specificity.Its just understood.Trump spoke to a local television station in Minnesota last week.Where there was collusion and where there was obstruction and where there was crime was on the other side, Trump said, because how did this whole thing start?It was a big con job, and everybody knows.The crime was committed by the other side.This crime was all made up.It was all a fabrication.And thats come out loud and clear.Its important to note that Trump has a lengthy track record of claiming that his opponents have broken the law without any foundation in reality.From encouraging allegations that Clinton violated the law during the campaign (a mantra eagerly embraced by Hannity) to claiming that the Republican Party illegally tried to raise money during the 2016 primary to claiming that then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch illegally decided against prosecuting Clinton to claiming that a CNN commentator sharing a debate question was somehow illegal.Everything he doesnt like is illegal, which makes narrowing down the specific allegations here sort of tricky.Broadly, though, Trump seems to be saying that the fact that he was investigated and no criminal charges were brought means that the investigation itself was unwarranted or illegal.Thats not how it works, of course: The point of an investigation is to determine whether legal violations occurred.They are usually kept under wraps in part to avoid impugning people who might be innocent, but its not illegal to try to determine whether someone broke the law.(Well note here that the exoneration Trump likes to say he received from Mueller was something substantially less than that.)Trump has also at other times claimed that the investigation was treasonous, which is definitionally not true.For example: ....big, fat, waste of time, energy and money - $30,000,000 to be exact.It is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes, perhaps even Spying or Treason.This should never happen again!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2019 Its a ridiculous claim, including that Spying is a very serious crime by itself, it isnt.But at least its fairly specific, unlike Trumps usual presentation of what he alleges happened.And with that specificity we can say with certainty: No, his political opponents didnt break those laws.
Trump mixes up Sri Lankan president and prime minister in tweet after Easter Sunday attacks:::::President Trump deleted a tweet Monday in which he had mistakenly said he had spoken by phone with Sri Lankas president instead of the countrys prime minister in the wake of the Easter Sunday explosions that killed 290 people and wounded more than 500.The deleted tweet marks the second time Trump has tweeted erroneous information related to the Sri Lanka attacks.In a now-deleted Sunday morning tweet, he grossly overstated the death toll as at least 138 million people.According to a statement from White House spokesman Hogan Gidley, Trump called Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Monday morning to express condolences for the attacks and pledge the support of the United States.But in a tweet Monday afternoon, Trump misstated both the name of the leader and the day of the call.Trump said he had called Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena on Sunday, according to Factba.se, which archives the presidents tweets and other public comments.Spoke to President Maithripala Sirisena of Sri Lanka yesterday to inform him that the United States stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism, Trump said in the deleted tweet.Also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the People of the United States.He later posted a corrected tweet stating that he spoke to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of Sri Lanka this morning.Spoke to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of Sri Lanka this morning to inform him that the United States stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism.Also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the People of the United States!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2019 The two Sri Lankan leaders have a fraught history.Last year, Sirisena had sought to oust Wickremesinghe and replace him with former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, sparking a political crisis.A majority of lawmakers rejected the power grab, and Wickremesinghe refused to vacate his office, even as Rajapaksa selected cabinet ministers and began conducting official business.Sirisena then attempted to dissolve Parliament, a move the countrys Supreme Court ruled was unconstitutional.A court also restrained Rajapaksa and his cabinet from functioning.After a stalemate that stretched on for seven weeks, Wickremesinghe prevailed and was once again sworn in as prime minister by Sirisena in December.Joanna Slater and Ishaan Tharoor contributed to this report.
Top Republican on House Judiciary urges Democrats to view less-redacted special-counsel report:::::Rep. Douglas A. Collins, the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, urged Democrats on Monday to reconsider the Justice Departments offer to allow them to view a less-redacted version of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs report.Collinss suggestion followed the rejection of that offer Friday by leading House and Senate Democrats, who are insisting that Congress is entitled to see the full report.To that end, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) sent a subpoena to Attorney General William P. Barr on Friday.In his statement, Collins (R-Ga.) said he had reviewed the less-redacted version of the special counsels report earlier Monday, including an 182-page section that explores whether actions President Trump took constituted obstruction of the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.[After Mueller report, Democrats divided over endgame investigate Trump or impeach] Collins said that the version of the report he saw contained only four redactions in that section and that it supports the principal conclusions that Barr announced last month.In a letter to Congress, Barr exonerated Trump of illegally coordinating with Russia during the 2016 campaign and of obstruction of the probe.With the special counsels investigation complete, I encourage Chairman Nadler and Democrat leaders to view this material as soon as possible unless theyre afraid to acknowledge the facts this report outlines, Collins said.He said the Justice Department was making an extraordinary accommodation.On Friday, Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said the Judiciary Committee subpoena was premature and unnecessary considering how much of the report is already public and the departments offer to let lawmakers see the less-redacted version of it.That prompted the letter from Democratic leaders rejecting the offer.The Democrats said Barrs proposal would allow only 12 members of Congress to view the less-redacted version of the report in person and would not permit them to discuss it with colleagues who all have top security clearances.While the current proposal is not workable, we are open to discussing a reasonable accommodation with the Department that would protect law enforcement sensitive information while allowing Congress to fulfill its constitutional duties, the Democrats wrote.The letter was signed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the top Democrats on the Judiciary and Intelligence committees in both chambers.Upon releasing Muellers report, Barr said the redactions fell into several categories, including material related to other ongoing investigations; material protected by grand-jury proceedings; information that was classified; and information that infringed on the personal privacy of peripheral figures.
Trump says ‘nobody disobeys my orders.’ Here are 15 recorded instances of exactly that.:::::President Trump attended a bilateral meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in June 2017.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) There is a narrative forming about the Mueller report.It says President Trump would be in a lot more trouble right now if those around him actually did what he told them to do.By essentially ignoring the boss on potentially obstructive acts, the narrative holds, these aides may have saved Trump from himself.Needless to say, this is not the kind of narrative a proud man like Trump prefers.So, he did what he always does on stuff like this: Deny it, no matter how ridiculous that denial might be.Nobody disobeys my orders, Trump assured Monday morning at the White House Easter Egg Roll.How wrong he is.Let us count the ways.The Mueller report includes many instances of aides declining to carry out Trumps orders; The Washington Posts James Hohmann recapped them on Friday.But its worth running through which ones actually involved orders that aides disobeyed.(For the purposes of this post, were not including mere suggestions, such as when Trump pressured then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to un-recuse himself and when Trump urged then-FBI Director James B. Comey to take it easy on Michael Flynn.)Toward the bottom of the list, we have also added previously known incidents of top aides declining to carry out Trumps orders.The list: White House counsel Donald McGahn: Declined to tell Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein to fire Mueller.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski: Declined to apply pressure on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit the scope of the Russia probe.Deputy Chief of Staff Rick Dearborn: Declined to give Sessions a typed note Lewandowski gave him relaying the presidents message.Staff secretary Rob Porter: Declined Trumps request to ask the No.3-ranking official at the Justice Department, Rachel Brand, whether she wanted to be attorney general and take oversight of the Russia probe.Transition team leader Chris Christie: Declined to call FBI Director James B. Comey and tell him that Trump liked him.Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein: Declined to do a news conference after Comeys firing saying it was his idea.Deputy national security adviser K.T.McFarland: Declined to write an internal email stating Trump hadnt told national security adviser Michael Flynn to talk during the presidential transition to the Russian ambassador about sanctions.Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats: Declined Trumps request to say there was no link between the Trump campaign and Russia.Acting Attorney General Dana Boente: According to McGahn, Boente declined Trumps request to state publicly that Trump wasnt under investigation.(Boente said he didnt recall this conversation.)Chief of Staff Reince Priebus: Declined to get Sessions to resign.Chief economic adviser Gary Cohn: Along with Porter, prevented Trump from pulling out of trade deals by pulling papers off his desk.Chief of Staff John F. Kelly: Along with Cohn, declined to lobby the Justice Department to prevent the AT&T-Time Warner merger.Defense Secretary Jim Mattis: Declined Trumps request to assassinate Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.Mattis: Declined Trumps request to provide military options for Iran.Unnamed officials: Ignored Trumps directive to not endorse an agreement reached at the G-7 Summit.Thats at least 15 instances of people declining to carry out significant requests from Trump ones that involved war, people who needed to be independent of the White House and also misleading or false public statements about issues of importance.Among those reportedly ignoring Trump have been two chiefs of staff, a defense secretary (twice), other top Cabinet officials and two people who were at the time overseeing the Russia investigation.
The case for and against impeachment:::::Democrats have a decision to make in the wake of the Mueller report: whether to consider impeaching President Trump over it.Its an enormously consequential decision that, in the worst-case scenario, could stain House Democrats as the lawmakers who had a chance but didnt forcefully act after a special counsel report found the president may have broken the law.But going after impeachment could also cost Democrats the 2020 presidential election.I think what we are going to have to decide as a caucus is: What is the best thing for the country?House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said Sunday on ABC Newss This Week.As Democrats spend the next few weeks debating their course of action after last weeks release of special counsel Robert S. Mueller IIIs report into Russian election interference, here are the arguments they are probably considering.The case for impeachment: Send a message to the next president that Trump-like behavior is not okay No one expects Congress to impeach Trump.That would require a sizable number of Republicans to be on board with the idea, and very few have even criticized the presidents actions as outlined in the Mueller report, let alone said it merits his ouster.But this camp argues that Congress should still go through the motions of impeachment to demonstrate to the next president that if you behave the way Trump did lying to the American people, indifferent or even hostile about the rule of law you will face consequences.Congress failure to impeach would set a dangerous precedent and imperil the nation as it would vest too much power in the executive branch and embolden future officeholders to further debase the U.S. presidency, if thats even possible, House Financial Services Committee Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) said in a statement after the Mueller report came out.Rep. Norma J. Torres (D-Calif.) told Politico that the Mueller report changed her mind about impeachment.She said she now absolutely believes that the president obstructed justice, which neatly fits the definition of high crimes and misdemeanors the bar for impeachment.These lawmakers appear to be the minority voice in their party, but four legal experts with whom The Fix spoke also say that Congress must do something for historys sake.If the precedent created by the Trump investigation is that a president can fire a special counsel investigating a president, then the Rule of Law is doomed, Jens David Ohlin, the vice dean of Cornell Law School, said in a statement.The case against impeachment: The political costs for Democrats are too high If the case for impeachment is a moral and legal one, the case against impeachment is a political one.Trying to get Trump out of office via the halls of Congress could directly undermine Democrats more realistic efforts to unseat him at the ballot box in 2020.Impeachment may play well with the liberal base.(Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Julin Castro have called for Congress to consider it.)But theres plenty of evidence that the rest of the country may view impeachment as an overreach.In a Washington Post-Schar School poll conducted last month, before the release of the Mueller report, half of the U.S. adults surveyed said the report will make no difference in whom they vote for president.Republicans, who are trying to win back control of the full Congress next year, feel on solid political ground backing up Trumps talking points that he did nothing wrong.A majority of the 40 pickups for House Democrats in the 2018 midterms came in more moderate districts, places such as Kansas and Oklahoma and New Mexico.Those voters, theorize Democratic leaders, are more worried about health-care costs and jobs than enforcing theoretical constitutional checks and balances for future presidents."Hes just not worth it, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told The Washington Post in March.Instead, she has urged her vulnerable Democrats to focus on kitchen-table issues.Like a jackhammer: lower health-care costs, bigger paychecks, cleaner government, she said recently.Her calculation appears to remain the same even after the Mueller reports release.The Washington Posts Karoun Demirjian and Rachael Bade report that Democratic leaders handed out talking points after the report that did not once mention the word impeachment.The case for pursuing Mueller report spinoffs: Its better than nothing This camp argues that there are ways other than impeachment proceedings to damage the president.House Democrats have launched half a dozen investigations into Trump that could be damaging to him.Democrats seem likely to fold the Mueller report into those investigations, which would help highlight it via high-profile hearings involving Attorney General William P. Barr and Mueller.But the pro-impeachers argue that its not clear what new information Congress could get about Trump and potential obstruction-of-justice actions he took via spinoff inquiries stemming from the Mueller report.Expect any interview Mueller gives to hew closely, even exactly, to the report, said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola University.Plus, Mueller had nearly two years to conduct his investigation.Congress has 18 months until the next election and a host of other jobs to do.It risks running out of time to conduct an investigation as legally and politically delicate as this.Every action carries with it risks, some more long-term than others.Democrats need to decide which risk they can live with the most, and it appears to be a very tough decision.
The Trump team still maintains Trump didn’t try to fire Mueller. Mueller disagrees.:::::President Trump and his aides are playing an interesting game with the Mueller report.They are claiming it as complete exoneration but also attempting to poke holes in its foundations and some of its details.And now, theyre going after its characterization of one of the biggest events in the obstruction probe: Trumps attempt to fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.Mueller, though, doesnt seem to harbor any doubt that it happened.In interviews Sunday and Monday, Trump legal spokesman Rudolph W. Giuliani and former Trump lawyer John Dowd both cast doubt upon former White House counsel Donald McGahns recollection of this.The argument put forth by Giuliani and Dowd is that Trump wasnt as direct about his request as McGahn seemed to believe.I think the president simply wanted McGahn to call [Deputy Attorney General Rod J.]Rosenstein and have [Mueller] vetted, Dowd told Fox News on Monday morning.He added: The president was entitled to do that.On the Sunday shows, Giuliani accused McGahn of giving competing accounts of the attempt to fire Mueller and his own threat to resign over it.He said he wasnt calling McGahn a liar, but that he was confused.The first version of that conversation is the president used the word fire, and he told the president Im going to resign directly, Giuliani told Foxs Chris Wallace.He then recants that and says no fire, no statement that I was going to resign.And then he comes up with ...a third version which is even softer which says something like, He should be fired or 'He has conflicts; he cant be special prosecutor.Giuliani added on CNN: "'He shouldnt be special counsel means its wrong that hes special counsel.It doesnt say any specific action.Its not clear what Giuliani is referring to when he references the three different versions, but he seems to be talking about the initial reporting on the event.The New York Times broke the story, saying Trump had ordered the firing of Mueller but that he ultimately backed down after the White House counsel threatened to resign.The Washington Post then confirmed those basic details but added that McGahn hadnt directly informed Trump of his threat to resign.Its worth emphasizing, though, that the Times never actually said McGahn had directly informed Trump.There is no evidence that McGahn, if he was a source for these stories, actually changed his account.The Mueller report addresses this issue, saying that The Post story clarified the Timess story not that it corrected it.In that respect, the Post story clarified the Times story, which could be read to suggest that McGahn had told the President of his intention to quit, causing the President to back down from the order to have the Special Counsel fired, the report says.As for McGahns supposed third version of events the one he gave to Mueller its rather unequivocal and consistent.A sampling: McGahn said Trump said something on their first phone call to the effect of You gotta do this.You gotta call Rod.On their second call, McGahn said Trump told him, Call Rod, tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and cant be the Special Counsel, and Mueller has to go, and Call me back when you do it.When Trumps personal lawyer reached out to get McGahn to knock down the Timess story, McGahn declined and his attorney informed the Presidents personal counsel that the Times story was accurate in reporting that the President wanted the Special Counsel removed.Trump then tried again, asking staff secretary Rob Porter to get McGahn to write a letter to create an internal record denying the Times story.McGahn again declined.McGahn shrugged off the request, explaining that the media reports were true.McGahn told Porter that the President had been insistent on firing the Special Counsel and that McGahn had planned to resign rather than carry out the order, although he had not personally told the President he intended to quit.In a later in-person meeting, Trump again pressed McGahn.According to the report, McGahn again said the central premise of the story was accurate.The President asked McGahn, Did I say the word fire?McGahn responded, What you said is, Call Rod [Rosenstein], tell Rod that Mueller has conflicts and cant be the Special Counsel.The President responded, I never said that.The President said he merely wanted McGahn to raise the conflicts issue with Rosenstein and leave it to him to decide what to do.McGahn told the President he did not understand the conversation that way and instead had heard, Call Rod.There are conflicts.Mueller has to go."So right there are three instances in which McGahn had his recollection of Trumps request questioned, all of them in private and under lots of pressure from the president.And in each one, he stands by his statements that Trump sought to have Mueller fired.The Mueller report itself acknowledges that this is a point that is disputed between the Trump team and McGahn, but it argues that McGahns version is compelling (key parts bolded): Some of the Presidents specific language that McGahn recalled from the calls is consistent with [Trumps] explanation.Substantial evidence, however, supports the conclusion that the President went further and in fact directed McGahn to call Rosenstein to have the Special Counsel removed.First, McGahns clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein not only that conflicts existed but also that Mueller has to go.McGahn is a credible witness with no motive to lie or exaggerate given the position he held in the White House.McGahn spoke with the President twice and understood the directive the same way both times, making it unlikely that he misheard or misinterpreted the Presidents request.In response to that request, McGahn decided to quit because he did not want to participate in events that he described as akin to the Saturday Night Massacre.... Third, the Presidents sense of urgency and repeated requests to McGahn to take immediate action on a weekend You gotta do this.You gotta call Rod.support McGahns recollection that the President wanted the Department of Justice to take action to remove the Special Counsel.Had the President instead sought only to have the Department of Justice re-examine asserted conflicts to evaluate whether they posed an ethical bar, it would have been unnecessary to set the process in motion on a Saturday and to make repeated calls to McGahn.Finally, the President had discussed knocking out Mueller and raised conflicts of interest in a May 23, 2017 call with McGahn, reflecting that the President connected the conflicts to a plan to remove the Special Counsel.And in the days leading up ta June 17, 2017, the President made clear to [Reince] Priebus and [Stephen K.] Bannon, who then told [Christopher] Ruddy, that the President was considering terminating the Special Counsel.Also during this time period, the President reached out to [Chris] Christie to get his thoughts on firing the Special Counsel.This evidence shows that the President was not just seeking an examination of whether conflicts existed but instead was looking to use asserted conflicts as a way to terminate the Special Counsel.In the end, Mueller was apparently confident enough to believe McGahns memory was accurate.At one point, the report even states flatly, On Saturday, June 17, 2017, the President called McGahn and directed him to have the Special Counsel removed.It seems the Trump team isnt finished litigating that point, but Mueller is.
Giuliani says there’s nothing wrong with getting dirt from Russians. The law says there can be.:::::Rudy Giuliani wipes his head on the South Lawn of the White House on May 30.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) rebuked President Trump last week following the release of the redacted report summarizing the work of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.Among other things, Romney said he was appalled that members of Trumps campaign would have welcomed help from Russia in the 2016 election campaign without telling law enforcement and including information that was obtained illegally.Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, now a member of Trumps legal team, dismissed Romneys concerns in an interview on CNN on Sunday.What a hypocrite, Giuliani said of Romney.What a hypocrite.CNN host Jake Tapper asked why Romney was being described as hypocritical.Because, Giuliani replied, any candidate would have taken negative information about an opponent.Giuliani appeared to be focusing on the information that Muellers report says was stolen from Democrats by Russian hackers and distributed through WikiLeaks.The Washington Post, he said, bore as much blame for reporting on that hacked material as did the campaign.Tapper again asked why Romney was a hypocrite."Because Mitt Romney did things very similar to that, Giuliani replied."Taking information from Russians?Tapper asked."No, no, Giuliani replied.Theres nothing theres nothing wrong with taking information from Russians.Tapper began to question that assertion when Giuliani continued.It depends on where it came from.It depends on where it came from, Giuliani said.Youre assuming that the giving of information is a campaign contribution.Read the report carefully.Let's set aside the political and ethical issues that overlap with accepting the help of a hostile foreign power for a political campaign.Defending why it's ethically questionable to accept that help should be fairly self-obvious.(Later in the interview with Tapper, Giuliani himself clarified that legality was the benchmark at which he was aiming with his comments.)Lets assess instead the legal issue: Is there anything legally wrong with taking information from the Russians to help a presidential campaign?Reading the report closely, as Giuliani suggests, offers a clear answer to that question.There can be.[Why the Trump Tower meeting may have violated the law and the Steele dossier likely didnt] There were two apparent efforts made by Russia to share information with Trumps campaign that are addressed in the Mueller report.The first is the June 9, 2016, meeting at Trump Tower in which the campaign was offered dirt on Hillary Clinton through a connection of Donald Trump Jr.'s.The other was the stolen digital information that was released by WikiLeaks in July and October of 2016.The report is explicit about the legality of the Trump Tower meeting and, importantly, situations like that meeting.Muellers team, referred to as the Office in the report, considered whether to charge Trump Campaign officials with crimes in connection with the June 9 meeting ..., it reads on page 185 of its first volume.The Office concluded that, in light of the governments substantial burden of proof on issues of intent (knowing and willful), and the difficulty of establishing the value of the offered information, criminal charges would not meet the Justice Manual standard that the admissible evidence will probably be sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction.This may sound familiar.Mueller isn't clearing Trump's team on this issue but, instead, saying that they didn't have enough evidence to be able to convict.We actually addressed this possibility last August, that the Trump Tower meeting itself might be a violation of federal campaign finance law.The law states that foreign nationals cant contribute to political campaigns and, in the words of former White House counsel Bob Bauer, is extremely broad in scope.Its breadth, he said, could mean both that the money spent on getting the attendees of the meeting to Trump Tower might count as a campaign contribution and that the mere acceptance of the meeting could be problematic for Trump Jr. Mueller's team ultimately decided there wasn't enough there to make a prosecutable case.For one thing, they didn't think that they could prove that the value of the information exceeded the statutory limit.For another, they didn't think they could prove that the violation was willful that, in other words, Trump Jr. even knew enough about the law to know he might be breaking it.A key passage in the context of Giulianis claims is this one: Political campaigns frequently conduct and pay for opposition research.A foreign entity that engaged in such research and provided resulting information to a campaign could exert a greater effect on an election, and a greater tendency to ingratiate the donor to the candidate, than a gift of money or tangible things of value.At the same time, no judicial decision has treated the voluntary provision of uncompensated opposition research or similar information as a thing of value that could amount to a contribution under campaign-finance law.Such an interpretation could have implications beyond the foreign-source ban ... and raise First Amendment questions.Mueller is arguing that accepting opposition research is potentially more problematic than simply taking cash but that there wasnt precedent for counting it as a thing of value.Much of the Mueller report's discussion of the legal questions surrounding the campaign's possible efforts to aid the distribution of the stolen material being published by WikiLeaks is redacted, probably in part as a function of the government's ongoing criminal case against Trump adviser Roger Stone.Stone is alleged to have repeatedly tried to contact WikiLeaks about its releases and, at times, to have informed Trump campaign staffers about what to expect.In July 2016 he was directed by a senior campaign official to find out more information about the documents WikiLeaks possessed.(He repeatedly claimed ties to WikiLeaks, but it's not clear he actually had any.)That much of the section is redacted makes it hard, as Giuliani suggests when discussing this issue, to read the report carefully.The only unredacted part of Muellers explanation for not seeking a campaign finance violation charge is again that he didnt know whether it could be proven that the violation was willful that is, that the potential violator knew the law.This is not, in any way, a demonstration that members of the campaign potentially working with WikiLeaks was a legally clean act, as Giuliani would suggest.Its also not clear if the redactions relate to some of the 12 also-redacted criminal referrals listed at the end of the report.(We also know, thanks to a footnote on page 176 of Volume One, that Mueller considered charging at least one person, perhaps a Russian national or WikiLeaks Julian Assange, with trafficking in stolen information in regard to the WikiLeaks material.Since the statute necessitates that the stolen material be physical property and not digital material [or even digital material stored on a physical device], it declined to seek an indictment.)Both of the discussions of accepting Russias aid described above come in the context of campaign finance law.A political campaign is a special circumstance where specific rules apply.The Washington Post can publish material released by WikiLeaks for a number of reasons, including that The Post was not at the time a candidate for public office.Campaigns have to meet a higher legal bar on working with Russia than your average person.In this case, Mueller did not prove to the world that accepting Russias help was completely fine for Trumps team.He and his team instead determined, among other things, that Trumps team might accidentally have broken the law not enough in the eyes of the Justice Department to bring the case to trial.Thats something that one might expect a former U.S. attorney like Rudy Giuliani to know.
What the media got right — and wrong — about the Mueller report:::::Michael Cohen, former attorney to President Trump, testifies before the House Oversight Committee in February.(Matt McClain/The Washington Post) For all the hand-wringing about overzealous punditry, the Mueller report was by and large an affirmation of the mainstream medias investigative reporting.Almost all the big stories were confirmed in the report.It confirmed that President Trump tried to fire special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, asked FBI Director James B. Comey for leniency on Michael Flynn, invited Comey to the White House where Comey said Trump asked him for loyalty, was pursuing business dealings in Russia in 2016 and was behind Donald Trump Jr.s misleading explanations of the Trump Tower meeting.Other stories that proved ahead of their time included the digging into Paul Manaforts foreign entanglements, Flynn being vulnerable to blackmail for lying to the White House, Trump asking intelligence chiefs and others to clear him in the Russia probe, Manafort meeting with a Russia-tied business associate during the campaign and the Trump team encouraging potential back channels with Russia.In fact, pretty much every story confirmed by multiple big outlets tracks with what we see in the report.At the same time, there have been a number of big stories that have long been in question, because other outlets couldnt confirm or because they were tenuous.The Mueller report allows us to revisit some of them.The BuzzFeed Cohen story The story: This was a big one.BuzzFeed News reported that Trump had directed Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow deal.If true, it would have meant that Trump had committed the crime of suborning perjury.Other outlets, including this one, wrote about what the report would mean if it were true, but couldnt confirm it.Then the special counsels office put out an unprecedented statement disputing it.What Mueller says: Cohen did not recall talking to the President about the specifics of what the statement said or what Cohen would later testify to about Trump Tower Moscow.He recalled speaking to the President more generally about how he planned to stay on message in his testimony.What it means: This is all according to what Cohen could recall.But he has flipped on Trump, meaning he has no reason to protect the president.Its also notable that Mueller doesnt directly accuse Trumps personal counsel, who was frequently in contact with Cohen about his statement, of directing Cohen to lie.BuzzFeed issued a statement Thursday acknowledging Muellers interpretation differs from that of its sources.EIC @BuzzFeedBen: "The facts of Cohen's lies and his interactions with Trump are, largely, now settled.Our sources federal law enforcement officials interpreted the evidence Cohen presented as meaning that POTUS 'directed' Cohen to lie.We now know that Mueller did not."https://t.co/Sm3PXMElqR Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) April 19, 2019 Michael Cohen in Prague The story: McClatchy reported Mueller had evidence Cohen might have been in Prague in the summer of 2016.That would have been big, because it echoed a claim in the Steele dossier that Cohen had met with Russians there to strategize about the 2016 campaign.McClatchy also later reported that Cohens cellphone had pinged a tower near Prague at the time.What Mueller says: ...Cohen understood Congresss interest in him to be focused on the allegations in the Steele reporting concerning a meeting Cohen allegedly had with Russian officials in Prague during the campaign.Cohen had never traveled to Prague and was not concerned about those allegations, which he believed were provably false.What it means: McClatchy has added editors notes to its reporting, stating, Robert S. Mueller IIIs report to the attorney general states that Mr. Cohen was not in Prague.It is silent on whether the investigation received evidence that Mr. Cohens phone pinged in or near Prague, as McClatchy reported.McClatchy never actually said Cohen was in Prague just that evidence existed raising that possibility and its theoretically possible its reporting was accurate.That said, this would seem to have been something Mueller would try hard to prove given its implications for potential collusion.It doesnt appear he was able to do so.(Also notably: While the Mueller report says Cohen had never traveled to Prague, Cohen has in the past told Mother Jones and the Wall Street Journal that he was there briefly in the early 2000s.He told The Washington Post at another point that he had driven through the city without stopping around the same time.He never said, though, that he had been there in 2016.)Alfa Bank The story: Slate published a lengthy story on the eve of the 2016 election with the provocative headline: Was a Trump Server Communicating With Russia?It reported that a server at a Russian bank called Alfa Bank had been connecting with a server linked to Trump in a way that some researchers thought unusual and suggested interpersonal communication.What Mueller says: While the report makes several mentions of Alfa Bank -- including about how executives sought to make contact with the Trump team during the transition period -- none of them addresses these servers interactions.What it means: As with Prague, it would seem this would have been something of significant interest to Mueller, if true.The fact that he didnt address it suggests it didnt mean much of anything just as The Post Philip Bump predicted almost immediately back in 2016.Paul Manafort and Julian Assange The story: The Guardian reported in December that Manafort had secretive talks with WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London in 2013, 2015 and the spring of 2016 during a time Manafort was on the Trump campaign.That would be huge on the collusion front, given WikiLeaks would just months later release hacked Democratic emails meant to benefit the Trump campaign.What Mueller says: Nothing.What it means: Again, this would seem to be something Mueller would have been very interested in, if it were true.Both Manafort and WikiLeaks denied it.And no other outlet has confirmed it.The Republican Party platform on Ukraine The story: During the 2016 Republican National Convention, the official party platform was softened to remove support for arming Ukraine against Russia and instead advocated appropriate assistance and greater coordination with NATO defense planning.Washington Post opinion writer Josh Rogin broke the news of the plank being gutted by the Trump campaign.The Los Angeles Times reported that Trump surrogates had intervened to make the change.After Manafort denied the Trump campaign was behind the change, the Daily Beast quoted GOP delegates who said it was indeed done by the campaign.What Mueller says: The investigation did not establish that one Campaign officials efforts to dilute a portion of the Republican Party platform on providing assistance to Ukraine were undertaken at the behest of candidate Trump or Russia.What it means: The reporting was correct that the campaign was behind it.Plenty of people have drawn further conclusions based upon that reporting, suggesting that Trump himself was behind it or that it might have been a favor to Russia.The stories linked above did not make such accusations.It is worth emphasizing, though, that Mueller says he did not find evidence for some of those more nefarious theories.Oleg Deripaska and caviar The story: In July 2016, Manaforts associate in Ukraine, Konstantin Kilimnik, wrote him to say, I met today with the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar several years ago.The Washington Post, which first reported on the email, cited anonymous congressional investigators who said they believed the caviar reference was to Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with close ties to Vladimir Putin.Other reports, including the Guardian and Business Insider, went on to state it as fact that it referred to Deripaska.But in a later statement to The Post, Deripaska denied ever interacting with Kilimnik.I made an argument at the time that it was plausible it was not, in fact, Deripaska, based upon how Kilimnik described caviar guy.What Mueller says: Manafort told Mueller it wasnt Deripaska, but that it was instead former pro-Russia Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.And that seems to check out to Mueller.Manafort identified the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar as Yanukovych.He explained that, in 2010, he and Yanukovych had lunch to celebrate the recent presidential election.Yanukovych gave Manafort a large jar of black caviar that was worth $30,000 to $40,000.Manaforts identification of Yanukovych as the guy who gave you your biggest black caviar jar is consistent, with Kilimnik being in Moscow where Yanukovych resided when Kilimnik wrote I met today with the guy and with a December 2016 email in which Kilimnik referred to Yanukovych as BG,' [REDACTED]."What it means: The congressional investigators were apparently wrong, though Mueller doesnt quite state as fact that it was Yanukovych.Reports that said definitively that it was Deripaska proved incorrect.Kilimnik and Deripaskas jet The story: Flight records have shown a private jet belonging to Deripaska landed in Newark shortly after Manaforts Aug. 2, 2016, meeting with Kilimnik.The plane returned to Moscow shortly thereafter.Independent journalist Scott Stedman first spotted the flight records, which were notable given Manaforts past work for Deripaska and apparent efforts to recoup money he believed Deripaska owed him.Vice News later offered an exclusive the suggested a possible connection and said that August flight has caught the attention of congressional investigators, in part because of its timing.Some have concluded that perhaps Kilimnik was flying on Deripaskas plane, but Deripaska has denied it and told The Washington Post that he never interacted with Kilimnik.What Mueller says: Deripaskas private plane flew to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey on the evening of August 2, 2016.According to Customs and Border Protection records, the only passengers on the plane were Deripaskas wife, daughter, mother, and father-in-law, and separate records obtained by our Office confirm that Kilimnik flew on a commercial flight to New York.What it means: The question wasnt whether Kilimnik flew to the United States on Deripaskas plane (given the plane arrived after his and Manaforts meeting) but whether he might have departed on it.Muellers report does not address that.But there is still no evidence that thats what happened.Kilimnik told The Post last week after the Mueller reports release that he flew commercial.This is one of the craziest inventions in the whole flow of insanities about me, he said.I absolutely and vehemently deny that I flew back from the U. S. on Mr. Deripaskas private plane.Tom Hamburger contributed to this story.
New research shows just how badly a citizenship question would hurt the 2020 Census:::::Elizabeth OuYang, coordinator of New York Counts 2020, holds a news conference in November outside a federal courthouse in Manhattan.(Mary Altaffer/AP) The Trump administrations attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census reaches the Supreme Court on Tuesday.Thus far, three federal judges have ruled against the Trump administration, most recently in Maryland.The Supreme Court will consider not only whether the administration violated administrative law, but also whether its attempt violated the Constitution.A crucial issue in the case is whether adding this question for the first time since 1950 will hurt the ability of the census to accurately count the American population.In particular, critics of the administration fear the question will dissuade some U.S. residents, especially immigrants, from answering the census.Research suggests these fears are justified.Working separately, we have used surveys and experiments to show that the citizenship question would make people less likely to respond to the census and provide complete information if they do respond.This is particularly true for Latinos and immigrants.Latinos and immigrants fear citizenship information wouldnt be protected.The first piece of evidence comes from a survey conducted by UCLA political scientist Matt Barreto from July 10 to Aug. 10.It included a random sample of about 6,300 adults, including oversamples in California, the city of San Jose and two predominantly Latino counties in Texas, Cameron and Hidalgo.This provided a larger sample of Latinos (roughly 2,300) and immigrants more generally.More details about the survey and its methodology, as well as a full description of the surveys findings, are here.[The census has always been political especially when it comes to race, ethnicity and national origin] The survey revealed profound distrust about whether any citizenship information in the census would be kept private.Nationally, only 35 percent of immigrants and 31 percent of Latinos trusted the Trump administration to protect this information and not share it with other federal agencies an issue that has already arisen in debates about the citizenship question.Trust in the Trump administration was even lower in California and San Jose.Substantial percentages of immigrants (41 percent) and Latinos (40 percent) are specifically concerned their citizenship information will be shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Its no wonder then that notable percentages also reported that they would not respond to the census if it included a citizenship question.This included 7 to 10 percent nationally (taking into account uncertainty in the survey estimates), 11 to 18 percent of immigrants and 14 to 17 percent of Latinos.These percentages were even higher among those with larger households, which would further exacerbate any undercount.A citizenship question experiment lowered willingness to respond to the census.The second piece of evidence comes from an experiment embedded in these surveys.All respondents were asked whether they would complete the census, but a random half of respondents were told that it would include a citizenship question.Barreto and George Washington University political scientist Chris Warshaw found that respondents told about a citizenship question were less likely to say they would take the census.The citizenship question caused a drop of more than two percentage points among all respondents.It caused six-point drop among Latinos and an 11-point drop among those who are foreign born.Warshaws analysis suggests that this would lead to substantial undercounts in states with large immigrant populations.For example, California could have an undercount of 2 to 4 percent or approximately 1 million people.These undercounts could affect the apportionment of congressional seats.California would probably lose a seat, and other states with large immigrant populations, such as New York and Texas, could lose seats as well.The same would happen for some counties and cities.Including a citizenship question would probably reduce the voting power of urban counties and increase the voting power of rural counties.It would probably reduce the voting power of New York City, Miami, Providence, R.I., and other large cities with substantial immigrant populations.Adding a citizenship question would hurt the quality of information that Americans provide.The third piece of evidence comes from an experiment embedded in a survey of more than 9,000 Americans, including an oversample of almost 5,000 Latinos.The survey was conducted from October through November by Harvard political scientists Matthew A. Baum, Bryce J. Dietrich, Maya Sen and Rebecca Goldstein.The survey mimicked the census short-form questionnaire and included an experiment in which half of respondents received a questionnaire with a citizenship question and half did not.The Harvard researchers found the citizenship question negatively affected peoples willingness to complete the survey.Overall, Latinos skipped 4 percent more questions when they received the citizenship question.Latinos born in Mexico or Central America skipped 11 percent more questions.Receiving the citizenship question also made Latinos less likely to provide information about their household members race or ethnicity and led them to report fewer household members as having Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin.Latinos who received the citizenship question underreported Latino household members by six percentage points.The Harvard researchers estimate that asking about citizenship would reduce the number of Latinos reported in the 2020 Census by approximately 6 million, or around 12 percent of the Latino population, based on 2010 figures.[There's a big problem with how the census measures race] None of this should be surprising.Whats remarkable about the citizenship-question controversy is that none of this should be news to the Trump administration.After all, internal census analyses have already estimated that the citizenship question could decrease response rates among noncitizens by nearly 6 percent.This evidence deserves to be front and center as the Supreme Court considers the possibility of adding a citizenship question.If the Trump administrations decision is upheld, our research suggests, it would severely affect the ability of the Census Bureau to gather accurate information about the American population.Matt Barreto is a professor of political science and Chicana/o studies at UCLA and co-founder of the research and polling firm Latino Decisions.Chris Warshaw is an assistant professor of political science at George Washington University.Matthew A.

Rep. Seth Moulton joins the 2020 presidential race:::::Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), center, speaking with others during a Texas campaign event for Joseph Kopser in 2018.(Tamir Kalifa/For The Washington Post) Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts launched a bid Monday for the Democratic nomination for president, becoming the 19th candidate in the most crowded primary in the partys modern history.Im running because Im a patriot, because I believe in this country, and because Ive never wanted to sit on the sidelines when it comes to serving us, Moulton said in an interview on ABCs Good Morning America hours after posting an announcement video on his website that highlighted his military service.The Massachusetts congressman, 40, a former Marine Corps captain who served in the Iraq War, was first elected in 2014 after ousting a scandal-plagued Democratic incumbent.He is the sixth current or recent member of the House to enter the Democratic contest and one of three veterans seeking the nomination.Like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, he has touted that experience as a reason he can defeat President Trump.During his interview on ABC, he called Trump the most divisive president in American history and said he would stand apart from others in the Democratic field because he is going to talk about patriotism, about security, about service.These are issues that for too long Democrats have ceded to Republicans, and weve got to stop that, Moulton said.Moulton has planned a series of media interviews on Monday before heading to New Hampshire, the first presidential primary state, on Tuesday.Weve never had a more reckless commander in chief, Moulton said last month during his listening tour of the first four primary states.Veterans arent going to let themselves be defined by a draft dodger.Moulton is also the second House member to mount a presidential bid after waging an effort to replace Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) as House speaker.Like Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who entered the race earlier this month, Moulton campaigned for multiple House candidates last cycle while calling for fresh leadership.And like Ryan, Moulton eventually voted to give the gavel back to Pelosi, but only after some negotiations over the partys rules.We have a speaker whos doing a great job with the president, Moulton told The Washington Post last month.We have an agreement on term limits thats going to give this new generation of leaders a voice.Honestly, in some ways, thats better than if we just had three new leaders in the House.While Moulton made some allies around the country in 2018 his Serve America PAC raised $4.3 million and helped elect 21 candidates he has not been strongly identified with either moderates or the insurgent left wing.During his appearance on ABC, he sought to put some distance between himself and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who self-identifies as a democratic socialist.Im not a socialist, Im a Democrat.I want to make that clear, Moulton said.As Moulton considered a run, his political team conducted focus groups in New Hampshire and South Carolina that found Democratic voters prizing an electable candidate above all other factors and not wedded to older, better-known candidates.They were warm, his team said, to the idea of supporting a candidate from a younger generation who could combat the presidents national security record.Moulton has echoed some of the partys left-wing activists in calling for the end of the electoral college and suggesting that court-packing might be necessary to combat conservative gains in the judicial branch.At the same time, he has criticized the concept of Medicare-for-all, citing his own frustrations with the Veterans Affairs health-care system to say that single-payer health care comes with real downsides.Maybe some of these folks should join me the next time I go in for surgery, Moulton said of single-payer advocates in a March interview with The Post.The Massachusetts congressman also separates himself from the two veterans already in the race with his focus on foreign policy.Gabbard, who endorsed Sanders for president in 2016, has called for an end to wasteful regime-change wars, while Buttigieg has talked little about foreign policy.Moulton, who held multiple roundtables with veterans as he explored his 2020 bid, has called for modernizing Americas military posture by prioritizing cyber and autonomous weapons instead of large military equipment.Russia and China have an inherent advantage over us by being more budget-restrained and less politically constrained, he said in a February speech at the Brookings Institution.They dont have the luxury of trying to compete with our big, expensive legacy weapons systems, so they have to develop the smaller, cheaper next-generation weapons.Moulton begins this bid as an underdog, though he often notes that he began his 2014 House run in a similar position.In 2018, he raised $2.4 million to defeat a Republican candidate who put up only token opposition; if he were to switch back from the presidential race to run for another House term, he would have until June 2020 to decide.Read more at PowerPost
Local Tory associations and senior MPs plot rule change to end May's leadership:::::Theresa may is coming under even more pressure to step down MPs are returning to Westminster after an 11-day Easter break with Brexit still deadlocked and Theresa May facing a double threat to her leadership.Senior government ministers are resuming their talks with leading Labour figures in a bid to reach a deal, but the two sides remain a long way from a breakthrough.And the prime minister is facing two new moves to accelerate her removal from Downing Street, from senior Conservative MPs and from pro-Brexit party activists.The 18 Tory MPs who make up the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee are holding an emergency meeting to discuss calls to change party rules to allow another leadership vote.And 70 Tory associations are demanding an extraordinary meeting of the party's National Conservative Convention in a separate bid to force another vote of confidence in Mrs May.Advertisement The MPs and the activists attempting to force her out both want the party to scrap the rule which prevents a second confidence vote within a year of the one she survived last December.And despite the PM's hope that the Easter break would calm the frenzied mood of Conservative MPs, the latest Brexit delay - until 31 October - appears to have hardened the mood against her.On the day the Commons broke up for Easter, Mrs May told MPs: "Let us use the opportunity of the recess to reflect on the decisions that will have to be made swiftly on our return after Easter."But one member of the 1922 executive has told Sky News: "She told us to go away and reflect.Well, I've reflected and my view is that she has to go now.This cannot go on."Those MPs on the executive who want the PM out want her to quit before 30 June and are urging 1922 Committee chairman Sir Graham Brady to tell her she must step down without delay.A senior backbencher told Sky News: "Trust in the Prime Minister is completely broken.Nobody believes she won't kick the can further down the road and try to stay on longer."Many Tory MPs fear disastrous results for their party in the local government elections on 2 May and in elections for the European Parliament - if they go ahead - three weeks later on 23 May.Some Tory activists claim they are "on strike" and refusing to campaign for the local elections and opinion polls are suggesting a surge in support for Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party in the Euros.An extraordinary meeting of the Tories' National Conservative Convention is being demanded in a petition, organised by Dinah Glover, chairwoman of London East Area Conservatives.The petition says local Tory chairmen and women "no longer feel that Mrs May is the right person to continue as Prime Minister to lead us forward in the negotiations".It adds: "We therefore with great reluctance ask that she considers her position and resigns, to allow the Conservative Party to choose another leader and the country to move forward and negotiate our exit from the EU."Ms Glover told The Daily Telegraph: "I am extremely sad that we have had to organise this petition to ask Mrs May to consider her position.But it has become increasingly obvious over the last year that she has become the block to Brexit rather the solution."Chairmen have signed the petition because they fear Brexit will not be delivered under her leadership."We need a Prime Minister who believes in the benefits that Brexit can bring to our country to lead us in the negotiations and out of the EU."That is the only solution which can satisfy our party and the British people.Enough is enough."The talks between ministers and Labour frontbenchers, which have been going on for some weeks but have so far not produced any indications of a willingness to compromise on either side, are resuming in the Cabinet Office.Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, Chief Whip Julian Smith and the PM's Chief of Staff Gavin Barwell will meet a Labour team led by Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer.
Labour 'must back second Brexit referendum', says Tom Watson:::::The Labour Party must back a second referendum on Brexit in order to defeat Nigel Farage's "backward-looking brand of politics", Labour deputy leader Tom Watson has said.Encouraging fellow party members to stop "being mealy-mouthed", Mr Watson said it was time to take advantage of an opportunity for Labour to "show real leadership" over Brexit.The shadow culture secretary's intervention comes several days after a YouGov poll revealed Mr Farage's Brexit party was leading public opinion for next month's European Parliament elections."We won't win if we sit on the fence about the most crucial issue that has faced our country for a generation," Mr Watson wrote in the Observer.Image: Nigel Farage says a second referendum would be a "total insult" to Labour's pro-Brexit supporters Admitting he was "a bit of a latecomer" to the notion of a people's vote, Mr Watson said he now believes it is time for a "confirmatory referendum", as voters "deserve better" than the former UKIP leader's Brexit promises "that would solve nothing".Advertisement The op-ed piece, which was published on Saturday evening, sparked a heated back and forth on Twitter between the two politicians, who both vowed to expose the other's "lies".Mr Farage started the exchange, says a second referendum would be a "total insult" to millions of pro-Brexit Labour supporters.Tom Watson has broken his promises to the people.The second referendum that he backs is a total insult to 5 million Brexit Labour voters.I now intend to wholeheartedly target Labour lies and dishonesty in the weeks ahead.https://t.co/5f5hhm8BxR Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) April 20, 2019 He added: "I now intend to wholeheartedly target Labour lies and dishonesty in the week ahead."In response, Mr Watson said his opponent offered "divisive opposition not responsible leadership.""I will take no lessons in lies and dishonesty from Nigel Farage," he said.
Derbyshire Tories boycott EU elections as Farage's party poses threat:::::Barry Lewis said he 'cannot go against the wishes of the people' Conservative councillors in Derbyshire have voted to go on "strike" and not help candidates campaign in the upcoming European elections, in an extraordinary show of local defiance to the national party.It comes as a survey of 781 Conservative councillors for the Mail on Sunday shows that 40% of them are prepared to vote for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party at the elections on 23 May.Every one of the 37 Tory councillors at Derbyshire County Council are in support of the boycott, meaning that hundreds of activists will not deliver leaflets or canvass for the party's candidates in the run up to the elections.Council leader Barry Lewis: "I suppose it is described in one way as going on strike, to not take part in a campaign for an election like this."It is with a heavy heart - we are an activist group at Derbyshire County Council, we want to support our candidates - but we simply cannot go against the wishes of the people.Advertisement "What we're hearing on the doorstep is... why haven't we got Brexit over the line?"Image: Activists will not deliver leaflets in Derbyshire Mr Lewis, who has been involved in the party since he was 14, said he had written to Conservative Party headquarters about their stance but had not had a response.He added: "We have fantastic, hard-working Conservative MEPs in Derbyshire but this was about not delivering that democratic mandate, that Leave vote on the 29 March this year."We felt we should have been out of the EU by now and that the prime minister and the government should have moved mountains to make that so."I think there's a groundswell among activists across the country who feel very much like we do."Donald Tusk: Do not waste this time The Survation survey for the Mail on Sunday found that 40% of Theresa May's councillors would vote for Mr Farage's Brexit Party, a figure that would fall to 22% if Boris Johnson was in Number 10.It also showed that three quarters wanted Mrs May to resign, with 43% of them calling for her to quit immediately, and there was almost complete agreement that the Brexit deadlock had damaged the party.Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Farage said that "millions of natural Tory voters have said emphatically that they will never vote Conservative again.And my strong sense is that they mean it".He added: "Far from being seen as the party to solve the EU question, the Tories are now actively regarded by a growing number of people as being a major part of the problem."Under Theresa May's stewardship, there has been near-anarchy on the Tory benches in Parliament for the past couple of years, as MPs have deliberately gone against the party's manifesto and done everything they can to thwart the referendum result."Image: Tom Watson says Labour must back a second Brexit referendum to combat Nigel Farage's electoral challenge Meanwhile, shadow deputy leader Tom Watson said the Labour Party must back a second Brexit referendum in order to respond to the electoral challenge posed by Mr Farage.Writing in the Observer, he said the party could not "sit on the fence" on the biggest issue facing the country, in comments which appear aimed at putting pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to make a second referendum a red line issue in Brexit talks with Mrs May.A "confirmatory" referendum on any deal was "the very least" that voters should expect, Mr Watson said.UKIP or Brexit Party?Dilemma for Leave voters Earlier this month, Mrs May agreed a delay to Brexit until Halloween after EU leaders offered another extension to Article 50.She acknowledged the "huge frustration from many people" that she had to ask for another delay, which followed three defeats in parliament for her withdrawal agreement.In a sign of the pressure on Mrs May, the Sunday Times reported that she will be told within days that she must step down by the end of June or face a fresh effort by MPs to oust her.The newspaper reported that Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, will tell her that 70% of Tory MPs now want her to resign.
May and Corbyn highlight persecution of Christians and refugee crisis in Easter messages:::::May and Corbyn highlight persecution of Christians and refugee crisis in Easter messages May and Corbyn highlight persecution of Christians and refugee crisis in Easter messages Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both have Easter Sunday messages The prime minister has used her Easter message to highlight the "danger" facing Christians, while Jeremy Corbyn focused on the refugee crisis.Theresa May says this "particularly special time" is used to "remember the powerful message at the heart of our Christian faith"."A message of hope - of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, when we can look forward to a new life in Christ," she says.The prime minister says she will spend Easter "as I do every year, giving thanks in church".However, she adds that "for many Christians around the world, such simple acts of faith can bring huge danger".Advertisement "Churches have been attacked.Christians murdered.Families forced to flee their homes," she says.Image: The prime minister says she will spend Easter 'as I do every year, giving thanks in church' "That is why the government has launched a global review into the persecution of Christians."We must stand up for the right of everyone, no matter what their religion, to practise their faith in peace."Easter is a time of reflection.For families and friends to get together and spend precious time with their loved ones."So let me wish everyone, of all faiths and none, a very happy and peaceful Easter."Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn used his message to "wish everyone a happy Easter" and to talk about the refugee crisis, highlighting that Jesus was "a refugee whose parents were forced to flee their home because of a campaign of terror by a dictator, King Herod"."Jesus went on to know what it was to be ostracised, rejected and tortured.A family forced to flee their homeland for fear of persecution," he said."Sadly, this is still so familiar to us today.There are 68 million refugees across the world, more people than have ever before been forced to flee persecution, war and abject poverty."Image: Mr Corbyn also took aim at the government The Labour leader added that the refugee crisis is a "moral test", saying: "Jesus taught us to respect refugees.He himself said 'welcome the stranger'.And the Bible says 'the foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born'."Mr Corbyn also took aim at the government."In Britain, we have a proud history of providing a safe refuge to those in need.But this government refuses to meet our legal obligations to child refugees in Europe as required by the Dubs Amendment," he said."At the end of last year as refugees tried to cross the Channel, Sajid Javid threatened to deploy the Navy.But in response the Bishop of Dover said 'it is crucial that we all remember we are dealing with human beings here'."Churches across the country support refugees, including through community sponsorship programmes.And who are campaigning to allow asylum seekers to work sooner.This is true leadership, drawing on Jesus' teachings to show us how we should approach this great moral test."So at this time of new hope and new aspirations we can learn from Christian values and offer the hand of friendship to welcome those in need."

'Admit you were wrong': UKIP deputy calls for a U-turn over rape remark:::::'Admit you were wrong': UKIP deputy calls for a U-turn over rape remark 'Admit you were wrong': UKIP deputy calls for a U-turn over rape remark A row has erupted at the centre of UKIP over one of the party's election candidates refusing to apologise for saying he "wouldn't even rape" a Labour MP.Deputy leader Mike Hookem criticised leader Gerard Batten for defending the remark, calling it "satire" and not a "literal statement".Mr Batten admitted it was "ill-considered" but has not dropped the YouTuber-turned-candidate Carl Benjamin from UKIP's runners to become a member of European parliament (MEP).Challenged on the issue by Sky News on Thursday, he angrily asked "how many times are you going to ask me the same question?"and walked out.Appearing alongside Mr Batten at UKIP's campaign launch for the European elections later that day, when asked if it was acceptable to joke about rape, Mr Benjamin said: "100% - deal with it."Advertisement 'How many times are you going to ask same question?'On Friday, Mr Hookem intervened the following day to call for both figures to "admit they were wrong".He said that "with free speech comes responsibility and accountability", and that he was "greatly disturbed" by defenders of the rape comment.Image: Mike Hookem said rape is 'not something that should ever be satirised' The deputy leader wrote in a Facebook post: "Rape is a heinous crime - often used as a weapon against its victims - that destroys the lives of the men and women who suffer it."It is not something that should ever be satirised or joked about, and it is certainly not in my concept of free speech to do so."I would like to see those involved drop the pretence, take responsibility which comes with free speech, and admit they were wrong."UKIP candidate: 'It's okay to joke about rape' Earlier this week, three female MEPs - Jane Collins, Jill Seymour and Margot Parker - quit UKIP over the issue to join Nigel Farage's new Brexit Party.Ms Collins said: "To have people like Carl Benjamin on the list for the party is something I find disgusting, and to hear Gerard Batten on national TV defending this man's use of rape as 'satire' made me sick to my stomach."I know women who have been raped and the mental and physical destruction it wreaks on these victims and their loved ones is the opposite of satire: it is a tragedy."
UKIP's Gerard Batten dismisses Brexit Party as a 'vehicle' for Nigel Farage:::::'How many times are you going to ask me the same question?'UKIP's leader has dismissed Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, telling Sky News it is "not a proper political party".Gerard Batten said the former UKIP leader's new venture was a "vehicle for one man" and added: "All you get from Nigel is rhetoric."One opinion poll predicts the Brexit Party could win next month's European elections, with suggestions many UKIP voters are switching to the new party.But speaking on the day UKIP launched its campaign, Mr Batten told Sky's All Out Politics that things could change with five weeks to go until polling day on 23 May.He added that UKIP was putting up 1,400 candidates in the local elections on 2 May, adding: "The Brexit Party doesn't have any candidates, because it's not a proper political party."Advertisement UKIP or Brexit Party?Dilemma for Leave voters Mr Batten claimed that in contrast to Mr Farage "we don't just say 'leave means leave', we tell you how we would do it, how it would work, what it would look like".He added: "All you get from Nigel is rhetoric."When asked what his pitch to voters would be, he said: "We stand for a clear unimpeded exit, unconditional, unilateral withdrawal."No ifs, no buts, leave and leave according to the way we say it should be done.So they can send a message to Westminster."During the interview, Mr Batten was challenged about his defence of a UKIP candidate who said they "wouldn't even rape" Labour MP Jess Phillips.'EU referendum wasn't about how we leave' The UKIP leader came under fire for describing Carl Benjamin's tweet as "satire"."That was in the context of a Twitter exchange, it wasn't a literal statement," Mr Batten said."It was an ill-considered statement, I certainly wouldn't endorse it."But Carl Benjamin is on our list because he joined UKIP some time ago, he's one of our supporters and he can get us access to a lot of people on alternative media, social media, which we are not going to get...we're not going to get a fair show in the mainstream media."Challenged further in a separate interview with Sky News political correspondent Kate McCann, Mr Batten angrily declared "how many times are you going to ask me the same question?"and walked out.Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party Mr Batten was also asked in his All Out Politics interview whether UKIP was "hostile" towards Islam.The UKIP leader, who has described the religion as a "death cult", said: "We are not hostile to people or groups of people, I just have said a few things about the ideology (of Islam), because that's what people are concerned about."Later, at the party's press conference to launch its European elections campaign, McCann was heckled as she again asked Mr Batten about his defence of Mr Benjamin.Mr Batten repeated his assertion that he doesn't "condone a joke or remark made by somebody three years ago".Appearing alongside Mr Batten onstage, Mr Benjamin said of his Twitter comment: "I'm not going to apologise for my crimes against political correctness, I hate political correctness."He told reporters: "I'm not answering your questions, I'm not apologising for anything, you dirty, dirty smear merchants."Image: 'I'm not apologising for anything, you dirty, dirty smear merchants,' Mr Benjamin told journalists Responding to Mr Batten's criticism, Mr Farage told Sky News his former party has "gone down the wrong path"."UKIP was a big part of my life," he said."For me to leave that, meant something had gone fundamentally wrong.And the truth of it is that most of the decent people have left it."Only three MEPs - Mr Batten, Stuart Agnew and Mike Hookem - are listed as UKIP members on the website of the European Parliament.Raymond Finch, who was a UKIP MEP, is listed as switching his allegiance to the Brexit Party on Wednesday.Mr Farage's party has 14 MEPs listed, although he claims the support of two more.
Frustrated, confused: What Leave voters plan to do in the EU elections:::::Frustrated, confused: What Leave voters plan to do in the EU elections Frustrated, confused: What Leave voters plan to do in the EU elections The Kentish seaport of Ramsgate played an unwanted cameo role in the unfolding saga of Brexit.It was the designated harbour for the ferry service that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling signed with a company that did not actually have any ships - at a cost of at least 6m to the taxpayer.In truth, a resumption of a regular cross-Channel ferry service would have been welcomed in the town.The lorry and passenger ferry to the Normandy coast stopped sailing a few years ago.Image: Nigel Farage in Ramsgate in 2017 Today, Ramsgate has a small coastal fishing fleet, dwarfed by the smart new craft of the offshore wind farm.Advertisement The fishermen worry that the turbines are scaring off the fish.There is a sense of a place left behind or overlooked by national politicians, although it has born the brunt of its fair share of austerity.No surprise then that the locals voted heavily for Leave in the 2016 EU referendum.UKIP has also enjoyed a strong local following.Image: The Kent town has unwittingly been a part of the Brexit saga Nigel Farage is a well-known local personality and is an outgoing member of the European parliament for the South East England region.He has also stood twice to become MP for South Thanet.He was defeated both times.The Conservatives poured massive resources into his last battle in 2015, when he took nearly a third (32.4%) of the votes.Now Mr Farage has broken with UKIP and is fielding candidates against it for his new Brexit Party.Most people thought the UK would have left the EU by now and few wanted or expected that we would be taking part in the European elections this May.They were wrong - but as my colleague Lewis Goodall reported, Mr Farage wasn't one of them.He is well-prepared for the campaign.Where does that leave Brexit-inclined voters in Ramsgate?Image: The seaside town now also boasts the largest Wetherspoon pub The overwhelming majority of those I met this week on a sunny afternoon in town were that way inclined.In summary, I got an earful of the F-word and the C-word.They are "frustrated" that the UK is still in the EU, and "confused" as to how they are going to cast their votes.If they cast their vote, that is.At least one lady said she planned to abstain in protest.Many people said they would vote for whichever party looked stronger on polling day.Image: Steve Barrett said he used to fly his UKIP flag from the boat That certainly was the view of Steve Barrett, a local fisherman who sailed in the 2016 Leave flotilla up the River Thames to parliament, which clashed with Bob Geldof's Remain protest ship.Mr Barrett used to fly UKIP's purple pendant on the Razorbill's mast.Today he's tempted by the party of the "plain-speaking troublemaker" Mr Farage.Of Mr Barrett's catch of quality fish and lobsters, 60% (in season) ends up at Boulogne in France.He reckons he will still be able to sell his fish there after Brexit with no problem saying "that's the way it's always been".Image: Mr Barrett, a local fisherman sailed the Razorbill in the 2016 Leave flotilla up the Thames His quarrel he says is not with Europe, where his parents and brother live, but with EU regulations which lead to large quantities of the fish he catches being wasted, discarded dead back into the sea.It is a similar story in Pete's Fish Factory, according to the chef Jack.The seafront fish and chip shop has been frequented by both Mr Farage and the local Tory MP Craig MacKinlay.Mr Farage is the visitor they are still talking about.Image: Chef Jack says the customers are frustrated Jack summed up his customers views on the EU question in one word: "Frustrated."I heard it again in the Royal Victoria Pavilion - a thriving social hub for the town now converted into the biggest JD Wetherspoon pub in the country.People do not understand why we are having these elections, and those drinking in the pub at least were tempted by the smaller Brexit parties.Nobody mentioned Labour or the Conservatives all afternoon.A split in the anti-EU vote between UKIP and Brexit would damage both of them in the European elections.But if I was Gerard Batten, UKIP's leader, I'd be worried.The Brexit Party and Mr Farage are making the running in the conversations in what should be a UKIP heartland.There are still five weeks to go but Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and other party leaders should start worrying as well.The latest YouGov poll gives the Brexit Party the largest share of support - with the Brexit Party 24%, Labour 17%, Conservatives 11%, Greens 6%, UKIP 6%.That may be just a quarter of the total, but if Mr Farage's results are anything like in the real contest at the end of May, he could come first in the European elections for the second time running.He'll have turned politics upside down again.He'd almost certainly have killed UKIP and revived the no-deal Brexiteers.On the other hand, if things go otherwise and the UK ends up staying in the EU, I detected a note of resignation in the pub."We'll just put up with it, that's the way we are," one drinker muttered into her pint.
Democrats subpoena ex-White House counsel Don McGahn:::::There is plenty of evidence of obstruction, House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler said Sunday on NBCs Meet the Press.Nadler on Monday subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn.| Zach Gibson/Getty Images Congress Democrats subpoena ex-White House counsel Don McGahn House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on Monday subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn as part of a his panel's obstruction investigation into President Donald Trump, demanding that McGahn testify in public on May 21.The subpoena comes just days after special counsel Robert Muellers report revealed that McGahn witnessed and testified about potential obstruction of justice by the president.Story Continued Below The committee is seeking to secure McGahns testimony as part of its investigation into the president, which kicked off last month with requests for documents and witness testimony from 81 people and entities associated with Trump.On Sunday, Nadler (D-N.Y.) said he intended to call McGahn to testify before the committee; on Monday, he made it official, asking McGahn to turn over documents by May 7 and testify two weeks later.The Special Counsel's report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses, Nadler said in a statement Monday.It now falls to Congress to determine for itself the full scope of the misconduct and to decide what steps to take in the exercise of our duties of oversight, legislation and constitutional accountability.McGahn has emerged as a central witness in the Judiciary Committees obstruction probe.He told Muellers investigators that Trump ordered him to fire the special counsel but that he refused the directive.The incident was first reported by The New York Times in January 2018.POLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.According to McGahn, Trump told him: You gotta do this.You gotta call [Deputy Attorney General] Rod [Rosenstein].Trump later said, according to McGahn: There are conflicts.Mueller has to go.Trump tried to persuade McGahn to publicly deny the Times story, but McGahn refused because he said the Times story was accurate.Trump later tried to get McGahn to memorialize a denial of the incident internally; McGahn again refused.Mr. McGahn is a critical witness to many of the alleged instances of obstruction of justice and other misconduct described in the Mueller report, Nadler said.His testimony will help shed further light on the presidents attacks on the rule of law, and his attempts to cover up those actions by lying to the American people and requesting others do the same.Mueller decided not to accuse Trump of obstructing justice, even though he described multiple instances in which the president met the criteria for committing the crime.Mueller, though, cited the guidelines from the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel stating that a sitting president cannot be indicted and said even informally suggesting Trump obstructed justice would be unfair outside the bounds of a traditional prosecution.Mueller said Trump repeatedly tried to influence the investigation but added that those attempts were unsuccessful because top aides such as McGahn refused to carry out his commands.Despite Trumps claims of total exoneration, Mueller specifically said his report does not exonerate the president of obstruction.If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state, Mueller wrote in his report.Attorney General William Barr also decided against charging Trump with obstruction.Democrats have taken aim at Barr in recent days, accusing him of misleading the public about Muellers investigation and using his perch to spin Muellers findings in Trumps favor.Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, denounced the McGahn subpoena as frivolous.Don McGahn sat for more than 30 hours of interviews with the special counsels investigation, and the chairman has answered that with a stunning 36-item subpoena, Collins said.Instead of looking at material that Attorney General Barr has already made available, Democrats prefer to demand additional materials they know are subject to constitutional and common-law privileges and cannot be produced.The subpoena comes as Democrats grapple with whether to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump.Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has said she opposes impeaching Trump, wrote in a letter to House Democrats earlier Monday that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings.Mondays subpoena for McGahn was not the first Nadler has issued since a redacted version of Muellers report was released on Thursday.The next day, Nadler subpoenaed the Justice Department for the full, unredacted report and all its underlying evidence.
Pelosi beats back calls for Trump impeachment:::::Whether currently indictable or not, it is clear that the President has, at a minimum, engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior which does not bring honor to the office he holds, Speaker Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Democrats Monday afternoon.| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Pelosi beats back calls for Trump impeachment 'Mueller didnt do us any favors he left us bread crumbs to follow,' said Rep. Val Demings.Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Monday rejected calls to launch impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump despite new voices in her caucus calling for the House to take that step in the aftermath of special counsel Robert Muellers report.The speaker vowed to wield the full power of her House majority to "uncover the truth" of Trump's "highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior in his alleged attempts to obstruct justice.But the longtime Democratic leader wouldnt endorse taking action to impeach the president despite a growing chorus from her partys left flank to immediately hold hearings on the potential ouster of the president.Story Continued Below "We can investigate Trump without drafting articles," she said during a call with House Democrats, referring to articles of impeachment, according to sources on the call."We aren't going to go faster, we are going to go as fast as the facts take us.""It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the President accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings, she wrote earlier Monday afternoon in a letter to House Democrats.Other Democratic leaders stuck to their scripts on Monday, pledging to investigate Trump thoroughly and downplaying impeachment talk.But some Democrats expressed impatience with the party leaderships resistance to begin a formal process for possible impeachment.We are struggling to justify why we arent beginning impeachment proceedings, said Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, according to sources on the call."As a 27-year law enforcement officer, and while I understand we need to see the full report and all supporting documents, I believe we have enough evidence now."poster="http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201903/2583/1155968404_6017121686001_6017094060001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404" true Mueller didnt do us any favors, Demings added, noting that he left us bread crumbs to follow.Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who has supported beginning impeachment proceedings in the past, said Democrats must consider the downside of the not [pursuing] impeachment in the face of this lawlessness.When one lawmaker, Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.) raised the prospect of a censure, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) who is firmly in Pelosi's one-step-at-a-time camp said censure would be possible but legally meaningless.Pelosi and top allies have spent weeks keeping a lid on impeachment fervor among progressives in the Democratic Caucus.Most of their colleagues have followed suit, promising thorough investigations.Even Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), one of the foremost impeachment advocates in the House, told colleagues on Mondays call that while she supports moving ahead with it, she isn't actively organizing with outside groups to pressure lawmakers to take that step.Though Mueller reached no official decision on whether Trump obstructed justice a decision he ascribed to technical considerations set out in Justice Department policy he laid out evidence that suggested the president satisfied all the elements of the crime in multiple instances.The decision leaves House Democrats, who control the impeachment process, with a momentous choice that their leaders have long sought to avoid.On Sunday, top Democrats seesawed between describing Trump's conduct, as detailed by Mueller, in grave terms and insisting impeachment is not an immediate consideration."We may get to that.We may not.As I've said before, it is our job to go through all the evidence, all the information we can get," said Nadler, whose committee is where any impeachment proceedings would begin.Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, laid out the political calculus Democrats would have to make, knowing a Republican Senate would be almost certain to derail any impeachment effort, regardless of any evidence of obstruction in the Mueller report."Thats a very tough question, and I think is one we ought not to make overnight," he said.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer doused talk of impeachment last week, shortly after the Mueller report was made public, saying he didn't think the process would be "worthwhile."Instead, Democrats have demanded more hearings on Trump's conduct and to hear from Barr who oversaw the release of Mueller's report and infuriated Democrats by painting a rosy picture of its findings for Trump.They also want to bring Mueller in to testify next month.Democrats like Hoyer and Pelosi who herself has downplayed the prospect of impeachment are intimately familiar with the fraught politics of impeachment.They watched as Republicans' efforts to remove President Bill Clinton sharply polarized the nation and then backfired on GOP lawmakers, who lost seats in the 1998 election, despite holding a typical historical advantage.Democrats today are hoping to avoid the same fate.Democrats also surged to the House majority in January on the strength of wins in districts previously held by Republicans, and leaders are concerned that any drive toward a party-line impeachment effort could endanger their hold on those districts and the House.Any impeachment effort led by the House likely would fail.Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate have indicated they have no desire to remove the president from office.But over the weekend, progressives began to rally behind the idea, led most notably by Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren.The Massachusetts lawmaker has urged the House to begin the impeachment process as "a matter of principle."Trump himself seemed to gird for the impeachment talk on Monday morning."Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment," Trump tweeted."There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you cant impeach.It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President!Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!"Trump on Monday also told reporters at the White House that hes not even a little bit worried about impeachment.When asked whether hes concerned that some staff wouldnt follow his instructions, the president replied: Nobody disobeys my orders.Muellers report revealed that multiple staffers didnt comply with Trumps demands, including McGahn, who recounted that he refused when Trump asked him to fire Mueller.Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment.There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you cant impeach.It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President!Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2019 Republicans have treated Mueller's report the same way Trump has: as total vindication for the president.They say Mueller's failure to establish a conspiracy between Trump and Russia as well as his technical decision not to accuse him of obstruction of justice amount to a declaration of Trump's innocence."Bob Mueller chose not to indict.Thats the bottom line," Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) said in a phone interview."According to the folks in Washington, Bob Mueller is the greatest investigator in human history and he chose not to indict."Pelosi took aim at Republicans in her letter Monday."It is also clear that the Congressional Republicans have an unlimited appetite for such low standards," she wrote of Trump's behavior."The GOP should be ashamed of what the Mueller report has revealed, instead of giving the President their blessings."But on the left, there is a clamoring for Democratic leaders to initiate the retaliation action against Trump.Impeachment talk began bubbling Thursday and grew to a crescendo over the weekend.Progressives on and off Capitol Hill pointed to the voluminous evidence that Trump attempted to obstruct the Mueller probe from ordering top officials to fire Mueller (only to be disobeyed) to pressuring former Attorney General Jeff Sessions to constrain the investigation.Mueller also found that Trump attempted to pressure witnesses to limit their cooperation with prosecutors.They accuse leading Democrats of stalling by arguing for additional inquiries or to see a version of Mueller's report that doesn't contain any grand jury redactions."It's time for Congress to take a stand," tweeted Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) Monday."I stand now where I stood on May 17, 2017, when I officially (on the congressional record) called for impeachment on the Floor of the Congress, after having unofficially called for it previously.Impeach Donald Trump."
Nadler says he will call McGahn:::::The special prosecutor found, Mueller found ... that there was plenty of evidence that the Russians intervened in the election to help Trump, Rep. Jerry Nadler said.| Cheriss May/AP Photo Congress Nadler says he will call McGahn House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler on Sunday said his panel would call former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify.We have to hear from other people like Don McGahn, who were going to call, the New York Democrat said on NBCs Meet the Press.Story Continued Below McGahns testimony in the recently released Mueller report has been at the heart of the controversy over possible obstruction of justice by President Donald Trump.In his testimony, McGahn spoke of being ordered by the president to fire special counsel Robert Mueller.Addressing that testimony, Nadler said Attorney General William Barr deceived the American people about presidential misconduct.The key is Barr clearly misled the American people on both obstruction of justice, where there was plenty of evidence that there was obstruction laid out in the report, Nadler told host Chuck Todd.Nadler also indicated he had no doubt the Mueller report, which was released Thursday, was more damning than Trumps supporters wished to admit.The special prosecutor found, Mueller found ... that there was plenty of evidence that the Russians intervened in the election to help Trump, Nadler said.There was plenty of evidence that the Trump campaign knew about that, you know, and wanted it and, in fact, knew about some of the WikiLeaks dumps of stolen information, supplied by the Russians, in advance.What he couldn't prove, was that there was beyond a reasonable doubt, was that there was a criminal conspiracy.On Friday, Nadler issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for the full, unredacted Mueller report and all the underlying evidence.
Schiff: ‘Ample evidence of collusion in plain sight’:::::House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff has been the subject of frequent attacks by President Donald Trump and his supporters for insisting that the Trump campaign acted inappropriately during the 2016 election season.| J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo Congress Schiff: Ample evidence of collusion in plain sight Responding to attacks by White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, Rep. Adam Schiff on Sunday insisted his criticism of the Trump administration was not wrong, saying there was ample evidence of collusion in plain sight.I use that word very carefully, the California Democrat said on ABCs This Week, because I also distinguish time and time again between collusion, that is acts of corruption that may or may not be criminal, and proof of a criminal conspiracy.And that is a distinction that Bob Mueller made within the first few pages of his report.In fact, every act that Ive pointed to as evidence of collusion has now been borne out by the report.Story Continued Below Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, has been the subject of frequent attacks by President Donald Trump and his supporters for insisting that the Trump campaign acted inappropriately during the 2016 election season by working with Russians who wished to see Trump elected.Before Schiffs interview on This Week, Conway criticized Schiff for repeatedly raising the idea of collusion.Adam Schiff in at least 14 tweets I saw today constantly on TV, collusion, collusion, Conway told host Martha Raddatz.It was meant to sound furtive, it was meant to sound criminal, it was meant to sound like the president would be frog marched out of office.Schiff insisted that his reading of the situation was not wrong.The obstruction of justice in particular in this case is far worse than anything that Richard Nixon did, Schiff told Raddatz, adding: I would say in every way this is more significant than Watergate.And the fact that a candidate for president and now president of the United States would not only not stand up and resist Russian interference in our election but would welcome it goes well beyond anything Nixon did.
Reparations debate gets new life in Dem House:::::Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee's bill, H.R.40, would focus on the way racism has been embedded in the nations institutions, rather than simply doling out cash.The bill has gained nearly 50 co-sponsors so far.| Alex Edelmann/AFP/Getty Images congress Reparations debate gets new life in Dem House For the first time in years, lawmakers are seriously discussing the issue.Democrats have sidestepped the debate over reparations for African-Americans for decades.But now the issue is bubbling up in the House, and the new majority is wrestling with how to tackle it ahead of the 2020 campaign.Sparked in part by the support of several presidential contenders, the topic has been discussed multiple times by top House Democrats, including at their retreat in the exurbs of Virginia earlier this month.Story Continued Below But the issue is likely to divide the party not just by race, but by generation.The Congressional Black Caucus is notably split, with some younger African-American lawmakers clamoring to force the conversation into the open while more senior members worry about alienating moderate voters.Im glad that were having this discussion and Im glad that it seems to be an adult discussion for a change, said House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.), the highest-ranking African-American in Congress.Were just getting people to understand that reparations, by definition, means to amend.Now the question is how do we make amends?A discussion over reparations isnt without risk, however, according to Clyburn and some other senior lawmakers and aides.Forcing the issue would likely open Democrats up to attacks from Republicans during the 2020 race.Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.You can unsubscribe at any time.But avoiding it especially with Democrats controlling the House with the most diverse caucus in history could also turn off voters of color who think its an important conversation to have, especially with President Donald Trump in the White House and white nationalism on the rise.As this administration has seemed to be forcing certain issues, I think that everybody wants to have an honest discussion about everybody who is in this country, Clyburn said.That Democrats are seriously entertaining such a response to the bitter legacy of slavery and discrimination against African-Americans underscores how quickly the party has shifted in recent years.While Barack Obama opposed reparations as a presidential candidate, White House hopefuls like Sens.Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and former HUD Secretary Julin Castro have warmed to it.Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), another presidential candidate, has introduced a companion bill to legislation sponsored by Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) that would create a commission to study the idea of reparations.Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), who leads the Congressional Black Caucus, said she believes the House could act on the issue in some way this year.One option is the proposal from Jackson Lee legislation first introduced in 1989 by former Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), but that never gained traction.Jackson Lees bill has nearly 50 co-sponsors and she told POLITICO she was preparing to send a Dear colleague letter in the next few weeks to solicit more support within the caucus.Jackson Lee also said she expects her bill to receive a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee.Speaker Nancy Pelosi has also publicly expressed support for the bill, though Democratic leaders have not made any commitment for a floor vote.We want to be responsive to all Americans and we know how diverse this country has become, Jackson Lee said in an interview.We have consistently, as Democrats, wanted to say to the American people that we are for the people.House Majority Whip James Clyburn speaks as Sen. Bernie Sanders watches in late March.Were just getting people to understand that reparations, by definition, means to amend," said Clyburn.| Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images The idea has backing from some of the progressive superstars currently driving much of the conversation within the Democratic Party.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has voiced support for reparations several times in recent months.And fellow freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who now represents Conyers Detroit-area district, is a staunch supporter of Jackson Lees bill.Her bill is exactly the starting point that we need to have a full-blown conversation about reparations, Tlaib said.Bass said she also supports Jackson Lees bill unlike some other legislation over the years because it would focus on the way racism has been embedded in the nations institutions, rather than simply doling out cash.My problem with the entire discussion around reparations is that its really used, in my opinion, to ridicule African- Americans, as if what black people are interested in is a check, Bass said in an interview.And thats not the point.The point is to really look at what has happened in this country, this countrys history, because we have never come to grips with it.On Thursday, April 11, The #GU272 referendum passed with 66.08% of the vote.Now, the board of directors must approve the measure for the reparations fee to actually take effect.poster="http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201904/1719/1155968404_6024059900001_6024060390001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404" true While some Democrats worry even the word reparations is too controversial because it could conjure the notion of direct payments to descendants of slaves, supporters note that theyre talking about something potentially much broader.Some Democrats, including Clyburn, said they support doing the study but note the process would take years to complete if the bill was ever passed by the GOP-controlled Senate and signed by Trump and that there are more immediate ways to help African-Americans and other underserved communities right now.With that in mind, Democrats are expected to use the appropriations process in the coming months to steer more federal dollars toward programs that directly benefit minority communities.Some examples include programs that aim to increase the number of doctors and nurses in minority communities, address food deserts in underserved neighborhoods and pump more money into preserving historically black colleges and universities.Im all for repairing the faults that exist in the country rather than waiting on somebody to do a study and then making recommendations, Clyburn said.Now Clyburn and other Democrats say theyre watching to see whether the question of reparations becomes an issue in the battle for the House.The issue came up at least twice during Democrats retreat in Leesburg, Va., at which the party celebrated 100 days in power and discussed the next pieces of their agenda.But right now, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Cheri Bustos said she doesnt see it becoming a prominent part of the campaign and the issue hasnt been raised by voters in DCCC polling.This is probably the first time as a caucus that Ive seen it come up, said Bustos.Were not talking about it in our [weekly] meetings.Freshman Democratic Rep. Jahana Hayes of Connecticut said she supports studying reparations, calling Jackson Lees bill the more realistic way to approach the topic.Hayes expressed frustration with what she considers pandering by 2020 candidates who simply say they back reparations but dont provide explanations of what that entails.I dont want to hear things for the sake of hearing them, Hayes said.What is the end game, what is the ultimate goal here?Other lawmakers said the public isnt paying attention to the debate.Rep. Joe Cunningham, a Democrat who flipped a heavily Republican Charleston-area district in South Carolina that is 19 percent African-American, said reparations didnt come up during his campaign last year.Its not something that came up in our election, Cunningham said.Certain things come up for presidential elections and come up every cycle you know this stuff about the Electoral College but from the day-to-day stuff I think the people are talking about other issues like the cost of their health care.Sarah Ferris contributed to this report.
Romney says he is ‘sickened’ by Mueller report:::::Sen. Mitt Romney said he was "sickened" and "appalled" by the contents of special counsel Robert Mueller's report.| Mark Wilson/Getty Images Congress Romney says he is sickened by Mueller report Sen. Mitt Romney said Friday that he was sickened by President Donald Trumps actions described in special counsel Robert Muellers report.In a statement, the Utah Republican said that while it was good news there was not enough evidence to bring criminal charges related to conspiring with Russia and that there was no conclusion of obstruction of justice, he blasted the White House and Trump campaign officials for their actions.The report, released Thursday, demonstrated repeated efforts by Trump to interfere with Muellers investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.Story Continued Below I am sickened at the extent and pervasiveness of dishonesty and misdirection by individuals in the highest office of the land, including the President, Romney said.I am also appalled that, among other things fellow citizens working in a campaign for president welcomed help from Russia.Romney blasted members of the Trump campaign for not informing law enforcement about Russias actions and went after former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort for actively promoting Russian interests in the Ukraine.Reading the report is a sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and principles of the founders, Romney said.The Utah Republican broke ranks with much of his party in condemning Trump.A number of Republicans emphasized the first half of Muellers findings, which said the special counsel did not find evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia, echoing the presidents no collusion mantra.Like his GOP colleagues, however, Romney called for the government to move on now that the 22-month probe has concluded.It is good news that there was insufficient evidence to charge the President of the United States with having conspired with a foreign adversary or with having obstructed justice, Romney said.The alternative would have taken us through a wrenching process with the potential for constitutional crisis.The business of government can move on.Democrats on Thursday keyed in on Muellers decision to not draw ultimate conclusions about whether Trump intended to obstruct justice, citing a number of instances in the report that said the presidents conduct satisfied all the legal elements of the crime.Romneys statement does not reference ongoing congressional investigations, which Democrats plan to ramp up in the coming weeks.The House Judiciary Committee issued a subpoena for an unredacted version of Muellers report Friday and are in talks with the Justice Department about plans for the special counsel to testify before Congress next month.
Dems reject Barr's offer to view a less-redacted Mueller report:::::House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks alongside Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in January.In addition to Pelosi and Schumer, the letter is signed by Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate.| Zach Gibson/Getty Images congress Dems reject Barr's offer to view a less-redacted Mueller report Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are rejecting an offer from Attorney General William Barr to view a significantly less-redacted version of special counsel Robert Muellers report, contending that Barr is too severely limiting the number of lawmakers who can view it.Given the comprehensive factual findings presented by the special counsels report, some of which will only be fully understood with access to the redacted material, we cannot agree to the conditions you are placing on our access to the full report, Pelosi, Schumer and other House and Senate Democratic committee chairs wrote in a letter to Barr on Friday.Story Continued Below The Democrats say Barrs offer, which would allow just 12 senior lawmakers and certain staffers to see the fuller version of the report, also fails to guarantee lawmakers access to grand jury material.They say theyre open to discussing a reasonable accommodation but that members of investigative committees such as the Judiciary Committee and Intelligence Committee in each chamber require access as well.While the current proposal is not workable, we are open to discussing a reasonable accommodation with the Department that would protect law enforcement sensitive information while allowing Congress to fulfill its constitutional duties, they write.In addition to Pelosi and Schumer, the letter is signed by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), and Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.).A spokesperson for House Judiciary Committee Republicans blasted Democrats decision to decline the briefing.Democrats demand answers but put their hands over their eyes every time those answers appear, the aide said.Attorney General Barr has given unprecedented accommodations to Chairman Nadler, and its unconscionable the chairman refuses receipt of information hes claimed for weeks Democrats are entitled to.Who subpoenas a report and publicly refuses to read it in the same day?The Democrats letter comes just a day after the Justice Department invited a select group of lawmakers to view a significantly less-redacted version of Muellers report.Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd had said the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees, in addition to members of the so-called Gang of Eight and certain staffers, would be able to view the less-redacted version next week in a secure setting at DOJ headquarters.The Gang of Eight, a group of lawmakers that regularly views the governments most sensitive secrets, includes Pelosi, Schumer, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the bipartisan leaders of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.But while that document would include classified information and evidence related to ongoing investigations which were deleted from the public version of the report lawmakers would still be blocked from viewing sensitive grand jury information.poster="http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201904/1766/1155968404_6027985514001_6027781660001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404" true Republicans have argued that Democrats efforts to obtain grand jury material in Muellers report is fruitless and that Barr is legally prohibited from doing so under Justice Department guidelines and judicial restrictions on releasing such information.Rather, they say, Democrats only recourse to access grand jury information is to open an impeachment proceeding, a step top Democrats have been loath to take without bipartisan buy-in.Democrats say Congress has received grand jury material after previous special counsel investigations including after Watergate and the Starr investigation of Bill Clinton.But Republicans say both of those reports were delivered in the context of impeachment proceedings.The Democrats letter comes on the same day that Nadler issued a subpoena to the Justice Department for the full, unredacted Mueller report and all of the underlying evidence.Democrats have contended that they have a right to use that information for their own obstruction of justice investigation into the president.Theyve also said that all members of Congress rather than just a select few members should be able to view classified portions.

Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Reps. Eric Swalwell of California and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan were on the receiving end of belligerent messages from 49-year-old John Kless, according to a complaint filed by the U.S.Attorneys Office for the Southern District of Florida.Story Continued Below All three have garnered increasing national attention in recent months: Booker as he played a prominent role in Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaughs confirmation hearing ahead of a presidential run; Tlaib for her vocal criticism of President Donald Trump and ascendance as a voice of Democrats rising progressive generation; and Swalwell for assailing Trump and promoting gun control as he pursues his own presidential bid.The complaint quotes a profanity-laced message allegedly targeting Swalwell, who has made gun control a centerpiece of his platform and clashed with critics on Twitter, warning that the day you come after our guns is the day youll be dead.Swalwell has previously highlighted similar threats, posting to Twitter a voicemail in which a caller can be heard mimicking the sound of gunfire and saying the California congressman would be a casualty.Swalwell responded to Kless arrest on Friday by praising law enforcement for for protecting my staff and constituents.Thank you to the @CapitolPolice and Florida law enforcement for protecting my staff and constituents.https://t.co/qOuVcbnDJ8 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) April 19, 2019 The alleged threats to Booker and Tlaib seem to reference comments about the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota who, like Tlaib, is Muslim that Republicans, including Trump, have seized on to lambaste Omar.In both cases, Kless is quoted defending the president.Tell your Taliban friend to stop talking about 9/11, he is quoted telling Tlaib, adding that this aint Trumps fault and you definitely dont tell our president, Donald Trump, what to say.According to the complaint, Kless had earlier made profane/harassing calls to the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) in which he spoke of Congress taking away his guns, abortion, illegal immigration and Muslims in Congress.

House Dems in talks with DOJ for Mueller testimony:::::House Judiciary Committee members Madeleine Dean, Ted Deutch, Jerrold Nadler, Hakeem Jeffries and Val Demings hold a news conference before the Mueller report is released.Committee Democrats are in talks with DOJ to arrange for the special counsel to testify before them.| Stephanie Keith/Getty Images Congress House Dems in talks with DOJ for Mueller testimony House Judiciary Committee Democrats said Friday that theyve engaged with the Justice Department about preliminary arrangements for special counsel Robert Mueller to testify next month.We have had several conversations at a staff level with DOJ [Office of Legislative Affairs], a committee spokesman told POLITICO.Story Continued Below The committee has yet to set an official date for Mueller to come in, but Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) has indicated he wants Mueller to testify no later than May 23.Committee officials said the Justice Department confirmed receiving Nadlers request.Attorney General William Barr told reporters Thursday that he has no objection to Mueller testifying before Congress.Barr is scheduled to testify before the committee on May 2.Nadler issued a subpoena Friday for the unredacted version of Muellers report, in addition to the underlying grand jury evidence and testimony.Muellers appearance on Capitol Hill would be among the most dramatic and consequential in recent memory, at least since former FBI Director James Comeys 2017 appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee.Democrats would be likely to press Mueller on his thought process behind detailing vivid instances in which President Donald Trump may have attempted to obstruct his investigation, as well as Muellers decision to not draw ultimate conclusions about Trumps conduct.But Republicans may also see advantage to Muellers testimony, as theyd get the chance to have him state for the record that he could not establish collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia as the Kremlin sought to sway the 2016 election for Trump.Georgia Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, urged Nadler earlier this month to call Mueller to the Capitol immediately, and suggested Congress come back from its recess to hear from him.Democrats declined and said they wanted to hear from Barr first.

Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisWarren unveils plan to cancel student loan debt, create universal free college Moulton enters 2020 White House race The Hill's Morning Report - Is impeachment back on the table?MORE (D-Calif.).* RELATED CONTENT Sanders leads, Buttigieg catches Biden in New Hampshire poll O'Rourke releases 10 years of tax returns Poll: Sanders leads pack, followed by Biden and Buttigieg Buttigieg responds to criticism after comparing Sanders, Trump supporters * Along the way, Buttigieg, a military veteran, Rhodes scholar and gay millennial leader, has been the subject of glowing media profiles.Some Washington insiders have compared his political skills to former President Obama.Hes accumulated an army of experienced fundraisers since announcing an impressive first-quarter haul of $7 million, underscored by five former Obama administration diplomats who told The Hill on Friday theyd raise money for his campaign.The former ambassadors raised millions of dollars for the Obama-Biden campaigns in 2008 and 2012.And Buttigieg has repeatedly spun impromptu moments on the campaign trail into viral internet moments.I didnt know Buttigieg existed two months ago, said David Friedman, a Colorado businessman who raised millions of dollars for the Obama-Biden campaigns and will now fundraise for Buttigieg.I heard him speak a few times and saw him interviewed and I just decided, hes the one.Hes inspiring.He has that fire in his belly.He appeals to your heart and your head.There was a time when national Democrats seemed deeply captivated by ORourke, who captured the imagination of liberals with his improbable run for Senate in deep-red Texas last year.O'Rourke carried that momentum into his presidential launch, raising $6 million in the 24 hours after entering the race.But there has been no subsequent bounce in the polls for ORourke, who has faced questions about why hes running and what he stands for.ORourkes viral campaign moments have both helped him and hurt him.At campaign stops across Virginia last week, several of his supporters said they decided to back him after watching a YouTube video in which he defended NFL players who kneel in protest during the national anthem.More recently, however, ORourke has been mocked for livestreaming a trip to the dentist and for setting off on a cross-country journey, in which he blogged about how he was in a funk as he languished over whether to run for president.O'Rourke was also criticized as presumptuous for telling Vanity Fair in a cover profile that he was "born to be" in the presidential race.Hes been running on pure adrenaline for so long now, said one unaffiliated Democratic strategist.In a race of 20 people, thats not going to be enough to help you break out of the pack.He was a great Senate candidate in Texas, but he hasnt adequately explained why hes running for president, other than that he can raise a lot of money and has nothing to lose.As ORourke has stalled, Buttigieg has been on a dream run.The trajectory of it is a lot faster than what we expected, Buttigieg told MSNBCs Rachel Maddow this month.This week, he went viral for offering condolences in French after the Notre Dame fire.And Buttigieg has been battling anti-gay protesters on the campaign trail and picked a fight with Vice President Pence over LGBT issues, rallying liberals behind him and earning national headlines.Liberal writer Ezra Klein and MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough have compared Buttigieg to Obama, both for his out-of-nowhere rise and his rhetorical skills, although some Democrats think its time to pump the brakes on those comparisons.There will be a lot of flavors of the month, but there will not be another Obama, said the Democratic strategist.And Buttigieg has yet to prove that he can appeal to black and Hispanic voters, which could be a serious hurdle for him in the Democratic primary.I think he is an impressive young man who may become a significant leader of the Democratic Party in the future, said Douglas Dunham, a top Obama-Biden bundler who is not backing anyone yet.He seems, however, likely too young to persuade enough Democratic primary voters to support him to become the partys nominee against Trump.He also appears to lack minority support, which is often critical for winning the Democratic nomination.Still, the media attention has a been a boon for Buttigiegs insurgent campaign.A FiveThirtyEight analysis found that Buttigieg got nearly three-times more mentions than ORourke on cable news last week and was the second most talked about candidate, behind only Sanders.ORourkes mentions on cable news, by contrast, have plunged since his presidential launch.ORourke is getting creative now as he tries to stand out in the crowded field of candidates competing for the medias attention.Last week, he became the first Democratic presidential contender to hit the ground in Virginia, a critical Super Tuesday primary state.ORourke focused heavily on racial inequality as he met with black and Hispanic leaders in the state.A recent Latino Decisions survey found that ORourke, who speaks Spanish, is near the top of the field with his favorability rating among Hispanics.Driving his staffers around in a Dodge Caravan, ORourke made eight stops in Virginia over the course of two days, leaving him hoarse on the stump.ORourke has been a relentless campaigner and hopes to win over voters on the force of his charisma and by outworking the other candidates.The Virginia swing attracted national media attention because of the proximity to Washington, but ORourke has been getting tougher scrutiny from the press in recent weeks.Reporters have peppered him with questions about his tax returns, which revealed that he gave less to charity than any other Democratic contender.The recent stretch has raised questions about whether ORourke had hit his ceiling.Meanwhile, new polls show there is a lot of room for Buttigieg to grow.A Morning Consult survey released this week found ORourke at 8 percent support and Buttigieg at 7 percent.But 62 percent of Democrats had still not heard of Buttigieg or formed an opinion on him yet.Fifty-nine percent have already heard of or formed an opinion on ORourke.Beto is still formidable, especially because of his ability to raise money, but I think he is going to continue to run into problems with the left flank of the party, said Andrew Feldman, a Democratic strategist.Pete is just getting started.He has a lot of room to grow, but its not guaranteed.As he continues to be seen as a top tier candidate and his stock rises, so will the scrutiny.It will be fascinating to see how he handles that.
5 takeaways from CNN's town hall marathon:::::Five Democratic presidential hopefuls made their cases to an audience of college students during a marathon series of CNN town halls on Monday, an event

contenders raced to stand out in a field that has so far grown to 19 people.Here are five takeaways from the town halls: Democrats are split on impeachment Special counsel Robert Mueller Robert (Bob) Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MOREs report may be out, but Democrats are far from unified on just how far they should go in addressing its contents.Warren, who became the first 2020 hopeful to call for the House to begin impeachment proceedings against Trump last week, doubled down on that stance, arguing that lawmakers have a civic duty to weigh in on whether the president should be removed from office.And Harris made news on Monday when she said that Congress should take steps towards impeaching Trump, pointing to what she said was evidence in Muellers report that the president obstructed justice.Mueller's report did not make a determination on whether obstruction had occurred, leaving it to Congress to make its own determination.But other candidates were more wary about the prospect of impeachment.Sanders warned that talk of the presidents removal from office could backfire on Democrats in 2020 by distracting from kitchen-table issues.And Klobuchar was similarly circumspect in addressing impeachment.She didnt say directly whether lawmakers should move toward such action, but noted that the Senate would ultimately have to weigh in if the House brings impeachment charges.Buttigieg said that he believed the president deserves impeachment.But he kicked the can to Congress to decide whether to take on that process.Im going to leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out, Buttigieg said.Warren shines.Will she get a bump?Since announcing her presidential bid on New Years Eve, Warren has been gunning for the moment that catapults her into the spotlight.On Monday, she may have gotten it.She led the way on the impeachment question, forcing every candidate on Monday night to confront the matter.And her recollection of experiencing sexism in her political career went viral.I jumped in the race and sure enough the only coverage is about what Im wearing, about my hair or my voice or if I smiled enough, Warren said in response to a question about whether she was worried about being Hillaryd held to a higher standard than her male counterparts on the campaign trail.The Massachusetts senators performance drew immediate praise from pundits on social media, including David Axelrod, a veteran Democratic consultant and former chief strategist to Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaJuan

April 23, 2019 Bernie gives political ammunition to critics Sanderss critics are chomping at the bit to cast him as too extreme.The Vermont senator might have given those critics new ammunition on Monday night to argue that hes outside the mainstream.Sanders was asked if he supports voting rights for incarcerated individuals, including domestic terrorists such as Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who is in prison and has been sentenced to death.Sanders unapologetically responded that everyone, including violent criminals who are guilty of sexual assault and murder, should be able to vote from prison.Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away youre running down a slippery slope, Sanders said.CNN host Chris Cuomo told Sanders he may have just cut an attack ad against himself.Ive written many 30-second opposition ads against myself in my life, this will be just another one, Sanders responded.A few minutes later, the Republican National Committee sent out an email blast calling Sanderss remarks beyond extreme.Buttigieg later got a big round of applause for disagreeing with Sanders, saying that incarcerated individuals should not be able to vote but that those released from prison should be re-enfranchised.Part of the punishment when youre convicted of a crime and incarcerated is you lose certain rights, Buttigieg said.Candidates try to tune out Trump The Democratic candidates are vying to be the one to take on Trump in the general election, but theres a clear effort underway to prevent Trump from saturating the entire debate.Democrats are trying to cut through the noise around the president with policy ideas they believe will appeal to the working class voters that propelled Trumps surprise 2016 victory.Time after time, the Democrats on stage refused to take the bait on questions about Trump, instead steering the conversation back to their policies.Warren was asked directly how shed handle Trumps insults if she becomes the nominee.She responded by launching into an extended riff about how she had to work her way up through the world after going to community college.Were not going to win by just saying not Donald Trump, Warren said.Were not going to win by doing better name calling than he does.The way were going to do this is get out and talk about our vision and how it affects families and touches people personally.And in warning Democrats that their impeachment efforts might backfire, Sanders said the party risks becoming consumed by the president and taking their eye off the issues that matter to ordinary Americans.I worry that works to Trumps advantage," Sanders said.Candidates forced to reckon with their past records Whether it was Klobuchars one-time reputation as a tough-on-crime county attorney or Sanderss lack of foreign policy expertise, every candidate that took the stage on Monday night was forced to grapple with their pasts.Warren, for instance, was asked about the fact that she was registered to vote as a Republican until 1995.She said that it was only when she became politically involved in the mid-1990s that she made the decision to switch parties.That's when I jumped in politically, Warren recalled.I got in that fight, and I fought it for 10 years, and by the end of that fight, I fully understood that every single Republican stood there for the banks and half of the Democrats did.And Sanders acknowledged that he was rightfully criticized in 2016 for his lack of foreign policy expertise, assuring town hall attendees that he has since learned to think a little bit more about foreign policy issues than I previously did.Buttigieg spent a good chunk of the night on the defensive over polices that critics have negatively impacted communities of color in South Bend.Buttigieg defended his demotion of the citys first-ever African-American police chief, but acknowledged that he underestimated the ripple effect it would have.I was a little bit slow to understand just how much anguish underlaid the communitys response to this, Buttigieg said.It was about whether communities of color could trust that their police department has their best interests at heart.And while he defended a program to demolish abandoned or vacant houses, Buttigieg nodded at criticism that it led to poor minority families being priced out of their neighborhoods.No policy is perfect and we learned some things the hard way on this one, Buttigieg said.

"I guarantee you that if I'm the last man standing and I'm still the majority leader, it ain't happening.I can promise you," McConnell added.ADVERTISEMENT His comments come as Republicans have seized on proposals like the Green New Deal and "Medicare for All" to paint Democrats as shifting to the left and embracing "socialism" as the next election nears."Now, my friends, we're having a legitimate debate about the virtues of socialism.And I don't want you to think this is just a 28-year-old congresswoman from New York.This is much broader than that," McConnell said.Ocasio-Cortez is the driver behind the Green New Deal, a sweeping environmental proposal which McConnell brought to the Senate floor last month in what he later acknowledged was a "show vote."On Monday, McConnell pointed to the large share of Democrats voting "present" on the Green New Deal as proof that socialism is "a pervasive policy view on the other side.""I don't want you to think this is just a couple of nut cases running around here on the fringe," McConnell said.McConnell told reporters earlier this month that the country needs a "referendum on socialism," tipping his hand to his 2020 strategy."Are we going to turn this into a socialist country?Don't assume it cannot happen," he added on Monday."It will all be in the hands, I think, of the voters of this country next year."

however, House leaders have pointedly downplayed that possibility.Democrats have taken issue with Barrs handling of Muellers report, accusing him of bias and suggesting he is withholding materials from members of Congress by allowing a limited group of lawmakers to view a less redacted version of the report.Barr ruled that the evidence collected by the special counsel was insufficient to accuse Trump of an obstruction of justice offense.On Friday, Nadler also subpoenaed the Justice Department for Muellers full report as well as the underlying evidence.The Judiciary Committee voted along party lines in early April to authorize Nadler to subpoena Muellers full report.The resolution also authorized him to subpoena McGahn and other former White House officials, such as Reince Priebus Reinhold (Reince) Richard PriebusTrump snapped at McMaster for taking notes during meeting: report The Memo: Mueller's depictions will fuel Trump angst Trump: Some statements about him in Mueller report are 'total bulls---' MORE, the former chief of staff, and Hope Hicks Hope Charlotte HicksEnd of Mueller shifts focus to existing probes Trump feared Mueller's appointment: 'This is the end of my Presidency' Investigators in Trump hush money probe interviewed Hicks, security chief: report MORE, the former White House communications director.Nadler signaled over the weekend that he wanted to hear from McGahn as part of the committees investigation.We have to hear from Barr.We have to hear from Mueller.We have to hear from other people like Don McGahn, whom we are going to call.We have to get the entire report, including the redacted materials, so we can evaluate it and so the American people can know what was going on and can make judgments, Nadler said on NBCs Meet the Press.Rep. Doug Collins Douglas (Doug) Allen CollinsDemocrats renew attacks on Trump attorney general Judiciary chairman issues subpoena for full Mueller report Judiciary Republican: Nadler 'only person trying to spin' Mueller report MORE (Ga.), the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, quickly blasted the move as a premature while pointing to the lengthy interviews McGahn gave to the special counsel."For the second time in four days, the chairman has issued a subpoena prematurely and contrary to his pledge not 'to issue a subpoena every time we have a disagreement with the administration,'" Collins said in a statement.Collins also made a dig at top congressional Democrats for refusing to review a less redacted version of the Mueller report, which the Georgia lawmaker did on Monday at Justice Department headquarters.Instead of looking at material that Attorney General Barr has already made available, Democrats prefer to demand additional materials they know are subject to constitutional and common-law privileges and cannot be produced, Collins said.Nadler and other top Democrats such as Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro PelosiTrump pushes back on impeachment talk: 'Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!'Moulton enters 2020 White House race Trump takes aim at Dem talk of impeachment MORE (Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerHillicon Valley: House Dems subpoena full Mueller report | DOJ pushes back at 'premature' subpoena | Dems reject offer to view report with fewer redactions | Trump camp runs Facebook ads about Mueller report | Uber gets B for self-driving cars Dem legal analyst says media 'overplayed' hand in Mueller coverage Former FBI official praises Barr for 'professional' press conference MORE (N.Y.) said Barrs offer was too rigid.It gave only 12 lawmakers access to this version, and lawmakers would not be able to review the full report, including grand jury materials, or discuss it publicly.Grand jury material is subject to federal secrecy rules, barring a court order for some exceptions.Barr has said he would not petition a judge to release the material.While they said they are willing to work with the attorney general to reach an agreement, the two sides appear to be at an impasse that could be heading into a prolonged court battle over such sensitive material.Updated at 5:58 p.m.

Harris Joins Impeachment Call During Democratic Town Hall:::::(MANCHESTER, N.H.) California Sen. Kamala Harris joined the call for President Donald Trumps impeachment on Monday as five leading Democratic presidential contenders clashed in a series of prime-time town hall meetings that exposed deep divisions in a party desperate to end the Trump presidency.Harris unexpected support for impeachment follows Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warrens push for Congress to begin the process to remove the Republican president following the release of special counsel Robert Muellers redacted report a plan all but certain to fail without significant Republican support.There is no political inconvenience exception to the United States Constitution, Warren said.If any other human being in this country had done whats documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail.The impeachment debate, which is raging among Democrats nationwide, played out on national television Monday as five 2020 hopefuls representing different wings of the party addressed young voters in first-in-the-nation primary state New Hampshire.While they took turns on stage, the forum hosted by CNN marked the first time this young presidential primary season in which multiple candidates appeared on national television for the same event.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now The five-hour marathon marked a preview of sorts for the partys first formal presidential debate, set for late June.On Monday, they clashed from afar while taking questions from college students about free college, free health care, gun control and impeachment.A central question underscored many of the questions posed to the candidates, who were in many cases forced to address their greatest political liabilities: Who is best positioned to deny Trump a second term?Bernie Sanders, a front-runner in the crowded Democratic field who has pushed much of his party to the left in recent years, was asked to defend his decision to embrace democratic socialism.Its a radical idea.Maybe not everyone agrees.But I happen to believe we ought to have a government that represents working families and not just the 1 percent, he said.Republicans, led by Trump, have spent much of the last year warning voters that Democrats would take the country toward socialism should they win in 2020.Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has cast herself as a Midwestern pragmatist well positioned to appeal to the middle of the country, refused to embrace Medicare for All, free college or Trumps impeachment.I wish I could staple a free college diploma to every one of your chairs, Klobuchar told the audience of college students.I have to be straight with you and tell you the truth.Warren, a champion for her partys more liberal wing, called for an ultra-millionaires tax on income over $50 million to help pay for free college, free child care for all children 5 and younger, free universal prekindergarten and student-debt forgiveness.We say good for you that you have now gotten this great fortune, she said of the nations wealthiest taxpayers.But you gotta pay something back so everybody else gets a chance.The Republicans tasked with helping Trump win re-election paid close attention to the Democrats answers, seeking political ammunition to tear them down.GOP Chair Ronna McDaniel pounced on Sanders call to restore the voting rights of felons, including people like the Boston Marathon bomber, who killed three people and injured hundreds in 2013 with a pair of pressure-cooker bombers and was sentenced to death.I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy, Sanders said.Yes, even for terrible people.McDaniel responded on social media: If you had any doubt about how radical the Democrat Party has become, their 2020 frontrunner wants to let terrorists convicted of murdering American citizens vote from prison.Its beyond extreme.There was virtually no discussion of immigration, an issue that has largely defined Trumps presidency.Most of the Democrats seeking the presidency support a pathway to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally, particularly those brought to the country as children.Foreign policy was also an afterthought for most of the night, though Sanders drew cheers from the young crowd when he condemned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for treating Palestinians unfairly.The Vermont senator said he believes the United States should deal with the Middle East on a level-playing-field basis.The goal, he continued, must be to try to bring people together and not just support one country, which is now run by a right-wing, dare I say, racist government.Just five of the roughly 20 Democratic presidential candidates participated in Mondays forum.Former Vice President Joe Biden, expected to announce his candidacy later in the week, was among the missing.CNN did not explain how it chose the participants.The cable network has held prime-time town halls for many of the candidates, including four of the five who appeared Monday.On impeachment, an issue that has exposed deep divisions within the Democratic Party in recent days, both Harris and Warren broke from Sanders and Klobuchar by openly calling for elected officials to begin proceedings to remove the president from office.Democratic leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have urged a more cautious approach because impeachment would be nearly impossible politically without significant Republican support.Harris said the special counsels recently released report tells us that this president and his administration engaged in obstruction of justice.I believe Congress should take the steps toward impeachment, she said.Klobuchar, like Sanders, sidestepped direct questions about impeachment.Sanders warned that pushing too hard to remove the president before the next election might distract from Democrats priorities on health care and the economy.South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg was also set to face voters Monday night.Contact us at editors@time.com.

Rep. Nadler Subpoenas Former White House Counsel Don McGahn:::::WASHINGTON House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler on Monday subpoenaed former White House Counsel Don McGahn for testimony following the special counsels report that said McGahn refused President Donald Trumps request to curb or cut off the Russia investigation.The New York Democrat announced his court action to compel McGahn to testify before the panel and provide documents.According to special counsel Robert Muellers report, McGahn was among the Trump aides who effectively halted the presidents efforts to influence the investigation, rebuffing his demand to set Muellers firing in motion.The Special Counsels report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses, Nadler said in a statement.It now falls to Congress to determine for itself the full scope of the misconduct and to decide what steps to take in the exercise of our duties of oversight, legislation and constitutional accountability.The subpoena angered Republicans even as it functioned as a reassurance to impatient Democrats who have called for Trumps impeachment.Nadler released the statement and the subpoena as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a conference call urged rank-and-file Democrats to let the investigative process establish facts before talking up impeachment.Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, pointed out that McGahn sat for 30 hours of interviews with Mueller and said Nadler was asking for some items that he knows cannot be produced.McGahn was a vital witness for Mueller, recounting the presidents outrage over the investigation and his efforts to curtail it.He described, for instance, being called at home by the president on the night of June 17, 2017, and directed to call the Justice Department and say that Mueller had conflicts of interest and should be removed.McGahn declined the command, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre, the Mueller report said.Once that episode became public in the news media, the president demanded that McGahn dispute the reports and asked him why he had told Mueller about it and why he had taken notes of their conversations.McGahn refused to back down, the report said.Nadlers announcement came as he joined Pelosi on a conference call with rank-and-file Democrats for the first caucus-wide discussion of the Mueller report since it was released on Thursday.In a letter earlier Monday, Pelosi acknowledged that the partys officeholders have a range of views on how to proceed.But she counseled them repeatedly to go after facts, not resort to passion or prejudice in the intense run-up to the 2020 presidential and congressional elections.She is the de facto leader of her party until Democrats nominate a presidential candidate.We all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth, Pelosi wrote.It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings.Either way, Trump insisted he wasnt worried.Not even a little bit, he said when asked Monday whether he was concerned about impeachment.However, his many tweets seeking to undermine the reports credibility indicate he is hardly shrugging it aside.Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment, he said Monday on Twitter.There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you cant impeach.It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President!We must show the American people we are proceeding free from passion or prejudice, strictly on the presentation of fact, she wrote.She added: Whether currently indictable or not, it is clear that the president has, at a minimum, engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior which does not bring honor to the office he holds.A series of hearings and investigations, particularly in the Democrat-controlled House, is likely to keep in public unflattering details about Trumps behavior provided both by the report and by his former legal fixer, Michael Cohen.Congressional panels are demanding the unredacted version of the Mueller report and its underlying material gathered from the investigation.Attorney General William Barr is expected to testify in the House and Senate next week.And House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has summoned Mueller to testify next month, though no date has been set.Muellers report last week described in vivid detail episodes in which Trump is said to have dispatched allies to fire Mueller, shut down his investigation and lie.The strength of the findings kicked off a struggle among Democrats over what to do now show restraint and investigate, or try to impeach?Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Julian Castro, a former Housing and Urban Development secretary, are for impeachment proceedings.Other Democratic candidates, including Sens.Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, have suggested it is too soon.New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, asked if shed support moving forward given a possible roadmap by the Mueller report, said in a phone interview Monday that she wants more information.It remains to be seen how many Democrats will get on the impeachment bandwagon.The issue has split the party since the day the new Congress was sworn in.That January night, freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was recorded using a profanity to tell supporters the Democrats were going to impeach Trump.After Muellers report was released, the most prominent of the Democratic freshmen, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, signed on to Tlaibs resolution calling for an investigation into Trumps conduct and the question of whether it merits a formal charge in the House.Muellers report is clear in pointing to Congress responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.___ Associated Press Writer Will Weissert contributed to this report.Contact us at editors@time.com.
Experts Warn Latest Trump Administration Move on Iran Could Backfire:::::President Donald Trumps decision Monday to end six-month waivers from U.S. sanctions for five countries that have continued buying Iranian oil the latest turn of the screw in his Administrations maximum pressure campaign against Iran was met with predictable outrage from Tehran.But some U.S. State Department, Defense and intelligence officials and outside experts warn that the move could backfire by causing ripple effects in countries like China, Turkey and Iraq.In response to the sanctions, Greece, Italy and, Taiwan had stopped buying Iranian oil, but China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Turkey have continued to import Iranian oil.The economic pressure has reduced Iranian oil exports from more than 2.5 million barrels a day to less than 1 million, discouraged foreign investment, and sent the value of Irans currency plummeting and inflation soaring.Announcing the move in a press briefing, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the decision to end the waivers was dramatically escalating our pressure campaign in a calibrated way that meets our national security objectives while maintaining well-supplied global oil markets.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now The Administrations objective, Pompeo said, include prompt Iran to renegotiate the international agreement halting its pursuit of nuclear weapons, halt its ballistic missile tests, and end its support for terrorist groups, which U.S. officials say include Lebanons Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas, Houthi militias in Yemen, and authoritarian regimes in Syria and Venezuela.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hailed the move, and Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said his country and others would ensure that the global oil market does not go out of balance.Some U.S. and foreign officials and outside experts, however, argue that the escalating attack on Irans economy is unlikely to prompt Iran to halt its support for terrorist organizations; force the countrys clerical rulers to renegotiate the deal halting their efforts to develop nuclear weapons; weaken its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its elite Quds Force; or turn everyday Iranians against the Islamic regime.If you dont know where youre going, any road will get you there, says Aaron David Miller, a Mideast expert and vice president at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington.And what is the Trump Administration strategy toward Iran?Even if its regime change or forcing Iran to retrench in the region, this recent move will accomplish neither goal.It might ultimately goad Iran to give the Administration a pretext for military action.But how would this change the balance to Americas advantage?Instead, said two U.S. officials who spoke only to the condition of anonymity to criticize the Administrations Iran policy, the Administration has not given much thought to the likely effects of its Iran policy on oil markets or on the nations, especially China, India, Turkey and Iraq, that now will be sanctioned if they continue to import oil from Iran.The Administration has launched a fairly significant initiative without doing the necessary groundwork with the countries that will be most affected, Suzanne Maloney, an Iran expert at Washingtons Brookings Institution, tells TIME.Iraq, which remains unstable, host to some remnants of ISIS, and divided on ethnic and religious lines 16 years after the U.S. invasion, is especially vulnerable because imports of Iranian natural gas and electricity are critical to its economy, she says.Worse, says Maloney, the Administration had signaled since November that the exemptions for buying Iranian oil cut would be made gradually until it abruptly announced they will end on May 2.Nor, says Maloney, does the Administration appear to have given much thought to how Iran might respond to the latest turn of the screw, which she says are likely to include efforts to disrupt global oil markets when demand reaches its peak this summer.In a tweet, President Trump said: Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian oil.The two U.S. intelligence officials on Monday dismissed Irans threats to close the Strait of Hormuz, but said Tehran could retaliate by disrupting Iraqi oil exports or launching cyberattacks on oil and gas production and export facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, or even U.S. or European oil companies, which could send oil prices upward during the vacation season in the U.S. and Western Europe.The officials said the 2012 Shamoon virus attacks on Qatars RasGas and on the Saudi oil company Aramco an attack then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta called probably the most destructive attack that the private sector has seen to date were traced to Iran.Oil prices rose about 3 percent at midday on Monday, but remained far below their October high of $86 a barrel for the benchmark Brent crude.Contact us at editors@time.com.

President Trump Drops Plan to Nominate Herman Cain to Federal Reserve Board:::::President Donald Trump said he wont nominate Herman Cain for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board after opposition from his own Republican party appeared to sink the former pizza company executives hopes for Senate confirmation.My friend Herman Cain, a truly wonderful man, has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board, the president said in a tweet on Monday.I will respect his wishes.Cain, 73, is bowing out after a path to Senate confirmation appeared blocked.A fourth Senate Republican said earlier this month hed oppose Cain, all but killing any chances that hed receive Senate approval if Democrats stayed united in opposition.The Trump loyalist, whose bid for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination ended amid accusations of sexual harassment and infidelity, had said as recently as Thursday that he was not going to withdraw.Cains comment, in an interview with Fox News, was made after an Atlanta woman came forward again with allegations of an extramarital affair that ended his White House run.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now The presidents desire to place Cain and fellow supporter Stephen Moore on the Fed board had sparked concern over the politicization of the U.S. central bank.The Fed answers to Congress and was designed to have independent control over monetary policy, insulating interest rates from short-term political considerations that might do long-term economic harm.Trump has shown no such restraint, repeatedly attacking Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for raising rates last year and discussing firing him in December as U.S. stocks tumbled.Since then, policy makers have become very cautious as U.S. economic growth slackened amid headwinds from abroad and they didnt project any increases this year in their most recent forecasts.With Democrats opposed to Cain and Republicans controlling 53 seats in the 100-seat chamber, opposition from a fourth Republican senator would have sunk his chances.Partisan Record Cain, who backed Trumps tax cuts and credited the president for a booming economy, had previously forecast a recession, which he blamed on President Barack Obama, and was arguing in favor of a return to the gold standard back in 2012.The White House had not submitted paperwork for a Cain nomination to the Senate, which would have been for one of the two open seats Feds seven-seat board in Washington.The other is earmarked for Moore, chief economist of the conservative Heritage Foundation, who has echoed Trumps demand for Fed rate cuts.As of Monday, Moore had also not been formerly nominated to the Fed by the president a routine delay as potential candidates for nominations undergo a background check.Moores selection has also drawn scrutiny after it emerged that he had been found in contempt of court after he failed to pay his ex-wife some $300,000 in alimony after their 2010 divorce, the Guardian reported, citing court records.Moore also owes more than $75,000 in taxes and other penalties to the U.S. government, according to a January filing in the circuit court for Montgomery County, Maryland, where he owns a house.Contact us at editors@time.com.
Medicare Will Be Insolvent by 2026, Government Report Warns:::::(WASHINGTON) The financial condition of the governments bedrock retirement programs for middle- and working-class Americans remains shaky, with Medicare pointed toward insolvency by 2026, according to a report Monday by the governments overseers of Medicare and Social Security.It paints a sobering picture of the programs, though its relatively unchanged from last years update.Social Security would become insolvent in 2035, one year later than previously estimated.Both programs will need to eventually be addressed to avert automatic cuts should their trust funds run dry.Neither President Donald Trump nor Capitol Hills warring factions has put political perilous cost curbs on their to-do list.The report is the latest update of the governments troubled fiscal picture.It lands in a capital that has proven chronically unable to address it.Trump has declared benefit cuts to the nations signature retirement programs off limits and many Democratic presidential candidates are calling for expanding Medicare benefits rather than addressing the programs worsening finances.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now Many on both sides actually agree that it would be better for Washington to act sooner rather than later to shore up the programs rather than wait until they are on the brink of insolvency and have to weigh more drastic steps.But potential cuts such as curbing inflationary increases for Social Security, hiking payroll taxes, or raising the Medicare retirement age are so politically freighted and toxic that Washingtons power players are mostly ignoring the problem.Later this year, Social Security is expected to declare a 1.8% cost-of-living increase for 2020 based on current trends, program officials say.Mondays report by three Cabinet heads and Social Securitys acting commissioner, urges lawmakers to take action sooner rather than later to address these shortfalls, so that a broader range of solutions can be considered and more time will be available to phase in changes while giving the public adequate time to prepare.If Congress doesnt act, both programs would eventually be unable to cover the full cost of promised benefits.With Social Security that could mean automatic benefit cuts for most retirees, many of whom depend on the program to cover basic living costs.We remain committed to further bolstering the programs finances, which will benefit from the long-term growth we will see as a result of the Administrations economic policies, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.For Medicare, it could mean that hospitals, nursing homes, and other medical providers would be paid only part of their agreed-upon fees.As an indication of Medicares woes, it would take a payroll tax increase of 0.91 percentage points to fully address its shortfall or a 19% cut in spending.Medicares problems are considered more difficult to solve, as health care costs regularly outpace inflation and economic growth.Social Security is the governments largest program, costing $853 billion last year, with another $147 billion for disability benefits.Medicares hospital, outpatient care, and prescription drug benefits totaled about $740 billion.Taken together, the two programs combined for 45% of the federal budget, excluding interest payments on the national debt.Contact us at editors@time.com.

Trump Sues to Block Congress' Subpoena For Financial Records:::::(WASHINGTON) President Donald Trump and his business organization sued the Democratic chairman of the House oversight committee on Monday to block a subpoena that seeks years of the presidents financial records.The complaint became the latest front in the intensifying battle between the president and the Democrats who control the House of Representatives and are committed to investigating Trump and his finances.The complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, said the subpoena from Rep. Elijah Cummings has no legitimate legislative purpose and accuses Democrats of harassing Trump and wielding their new majority in Congress to try to stain the presidents standing.Instead of working with the President to pass bipartisan legislation that would actually benefit Americans, House Democrats are singularly obsessed with finding something they can use to damage the President politically, the lawsuit states.Cummings, a Maryland Democrat and chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, issued the subpoena earlier this month to Mazars USA, an accountant for the president and Trump Organization.He said Monday that the complaint reads more like political talking points than a reasoned legal brief, and it contains a litany of inaccurate information.The Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.View Sample Sign Up Now The President has a long history of trying to use baseless lawsuits to attack his adversaries, but there is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress, Cummings said.The White House is engaged in unprecedented stonewalling on all fronts, and they have refused to produce a single document or witness to the Oversight Committee during this entire year.The lawsuit accuses Cummings of failing to consult with Republicans on the panel before issuing the subpoena and says he relied on the testimony of Trumps former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, who told lawmakers in February that some of Trumps financial statements contained inaccuracies.Cohen pleaded guilty last year to lying to Congress in 2017 about a real estate deal involving Trump in Moscow.The Cohen hearing was a partisan stunt, not a good-faith effort to obtain accurate testimony from a reliable witness, the lawsuit says.The suit, in a sense, amounts to Trump the leader of the executive branch of government asking the judicial branch to stop the legislative branch from investigating his past.To do so would break decades of precedent, which established that the legislatures investigative power is not limited to just researching possible legislation.Trump advisers have argued that the newest requests are fishing expeditions, broad-based inquires meant to extend beyond what should be in the investigators purview in order to embarrass Trump and could set a dangerous precedent for future chief executives.The complaint also says the subpoena seeks to investigate events that occurred before Trump was president and has no legitimate legislative purpose.It says, Democrats are using their new control of congressional committees to investigate every aspect of President Trumps personal finances, businesses, and even his family.Jay Sekulow, one of Trumps lawyers, said in a statement Monday that we will not allow presidential harassment to go unanswered.Neither the White House nor Trump Organization responded to requests for comment.The lawsuit comes amid a widespread effort by the White House and the presidents attorneys to refuse to cooperate with congressional requests for information and records.Earlier this month, the Treasury Department missed a deadline to hand over Trumps tax returns to the House Ways and Means Committee.A new deadline was set for Tuesday but there has been no indication that Trumps team plans to cooperate.A White House spokesman referred requests for comment to one of the presidents personal attorneys, who did not immediately respond.Lanny Davis, Cohens representative, linked the complaint to Trumps ongoing effort to shield his taxes.The reasons for Mr. Trumps desperate attempt to prevent his tax returns from being made public like all prior presidents is no mystery, Davis said.Does anyone doubt he has something to hide?And White House officials have refused to comply with other requests related to Trumps actions as president.The administration, for instance, has also signaled it does not plan to turn over information being sought about how particular staffers, including senior aides like Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, received their security clearances.Contact us at editors@time.com.
Bernie: Even Marathon Bomber Should Have Right to Vote:::::Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said Monday he thinks everyone should have the right to vote -- even the Boston Marathon bomber.At a CNN Town Hall, Sanders argued democracy demands that right for every American."This is a democracy and we have got to expand that democracy, and I believe every single person does have the right to vote," he said.Asked if that included sex offenders, the Boston Marathon bomber, terrorists, and murderers, Sanders replied: "Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away and you say, 'Well, that guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote.Well, that person did that.Not going to let that person vote,' you're running down a slippery slope."So, I believe people commit crimes, and they paid the price, and they have the right to vote.I believe even if they're in jail they're paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy."Earlier this month, Sanders called for more states to join Vermont and Maine in allowing felons behind bars to vote, the Des Moines Register reported.
Dem Leaders Stress More Trump Probes, Downplay Impeachment:::::A House chairman on Monday subpoenaed former White House Counsel Don McGahn as Democratic leaders moved to deepen their investigation of President Donald Trump while bottling up talk among their rank-and-file of impeaching him.Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler was one of six powerful committee leaders making their case on a conference call with other House Democrats late in the day that they are effectively investigating Trump-related matters ranging from potential obstruction to his personal and business taxes.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged divided Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment proceedings after the damning details of special counsel Robert Mueller's report.Nadler and the other chairmen made clear they believe Trump did obstruct justice, according to people on the call who weren't authorized to discuss it by name.McGahn would be a star witness for any such case because he refused Trump's demand to set Mueller's firing in motion, according to the report."The Special Counsel's report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses," Nadler said in a statement released as the conference call got underway."It now falls to Congress to determine for itself the full scope of the misconduct and to decide what steps to take in the exercise of our duties of oversight, legislation and constitutional accountability."The subpoena angered Republicans even as it functioned as a reassurance to impatient Democrats.Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, pointed out that McGahn sat for 30 hours of interviews with Mueller and said Nadler was asking for some items that he knows cannot be produced.Trump himself insisted he wasn't worried."Not even a little bit," he said when asked Monday whether he was concerned about impeachment.However, his many tweets seeking to undermine the report's credibility indicate he is hardly shrugging it aside."Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment," he said Monday on Twitter."There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you can't impeach.It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President!"On the other end of the scale, Pelosi's approach disappointed some Democrats who are agitating for impeachment proceedings.According to her spokesman, Rep. Val Demings of Florida said she believed the House has enough evidence to begin the process.McGahn was a vital witness for Mueller, recounting the president's outrage over the investigation and his efforts to curtail it.The former White House counsel described, for instance, being called at home by the president on the night of June 17, 2017, and directed to call the Justice Department and say that Mueller had conflicts of interest and should be removed.McGahn declined the command, "deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre," the Mueller report said.Once that episode became public in the news media, the president demanded that McGahn dispute the reports and asked him why he had told Mueller about it and why he had taken notes of their conversations.McGahn refused to back down, the report said.Nadler's announcement was one of several leadership moves aimed at calming a struggle among Democrats to speak with one voice about what to do in light of Mueller's startling account of Trump's repeated efforts to fire him, shut down his probe and get allies to lie.After Mueller's report was released last week, the most prominent of the Democratic freshmen, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, signed on to Rep. Rashida Tlaib's resolution calling for an investigation into Trump's conduct and the question of whether it merits a formal impeachment charge in the House."Mueller's report is clear in pointing to Congress' responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.On Monday, Pelosi's letter made clear there was no Democratic disagreement that Trump "at a minimum, engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior which does not bring honor to the office he holds."But she acknowledged the party's officeholders have a range of views on how to proceed.She counseled them repeatedly to go after facts, not resort to "passion or prejudice" in the intense run-up to the 2020 presidential and congressional elections.She is the de facto leader of her party until Democrats nominate a candidate to challenge Trump, so her words echoed on the presidential campaign trail."We all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth," Pelosi wrote."It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings."As the conference call got underway, Nadler's subpoena announcement was made public, an indication that the facts-first approach was moving ahead.Pelosi, calling from New York City, spoke briefly.Then she put a show of leadership force on the line six committee chairmen, some of the most powerful people in Congress to give more details, according to people on the call.Nadler went first.Others who followed were Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Water and Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal.The call lasted about 90 minutes and included about 170 Democrats.During a series of town hall events on CNN Monday night, several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates weighed in.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren repeated her call for an impeachment vote, saying that if lawmakers believe the president's actions were appropriate, "they should have to take that vote and live with it."California Sen. Kamala Harris said she believes "Congress should take the steps toward impeachment."Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Trump should be held accountable, but she stopped short of calling for impeachment.There's more coming to keep Trump's reported misdeeds in public.Congressional panels are demanding the unredacted version of the Mueller report and its underlying material gathered from the investigation.Attorney General William Barr is expected to testify in the House and Senate next week.Nadler has summoned Mueller to testify next month, though no date has been set.In the face of the intense run-up to the 2020 election, Pelosi implicitly suggested Democrats resist creating episodes like the one in January in which Tlaib was recorded declaring the House would impeach Trump."We must show the American people we are proceeding free from passion or prejudice, strictly on the presentation of fact," Pelosi wrote.
Sanders Poll: Bernie Topping Trump in Wis., Mich., Pa.:::::Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., leads President Donald Trump in hypothetical matchups in three states that proved critical for Trump's 2016 victory, NBC News reported.The internal polling conducted by the Sanders team showed 52% of likely voters in Michigan inclined to back Sanders in the 2020 general election, compared with 41% for Trump, the news outlet reported.In Wisconsin, 52% of voters said they would back Sanders, while 42% said they would vote for Trump.In Pennsylvania, 51% of likely voters said they would support Sanders, while 43% would vote for Trump.All three swing states solidified Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election."I don't think it's any generic Democrat fits the mold here," Sanders pollster Ben Tulchin told NBC News."Trump is vulnerable here, but it has to be for the right kind of Democrat who has real strengths and can win these three states.""I don't think any other candidate is as well positioned as Bernie is in these three states," Tulchin said.The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.
Obama Praises Young Activists on Earth Day:::::Former President Barack Obama marked Earth Day on Monday with praise for young activists "stepping up to save the one planet we've got."Obama tweeted: "Young people all over the world are leading the way in the fight to protect our planet because they know their future depends on it.This Earth Day, I want to celebrate the courageous, committed young leaders who are stepping up to save the one planet we've got."In particular, Obama lauded Greta Thunberg, a Swedish teen who helped fuel an interest in young people to fight climate change."They're people like 16-year-old @GretaThunberg, whose protests at Swedish parliament sparked a movement," Obama wrote in a separate tweet."Inspired by Greta's action, Fridays for Future brought together more than a million strikers on every continent last month to demand action on climate."The former commander-in-chief's message was in contrast with that of President Donald Trump, whose Earth Day tweet stressed "historic economic and job growth," but made no mention of climate change."Environmental protection and economic prosperity go hand in hand," Trump said in a statement issued Monday."A strong market economy is essential to protecting our critical natural resources and fostering a legacy of conservation."
Klobuchar Urges Town Hall Audience to Cheer:::::Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota urged a town hall audience in New Hampshire to cheer after one of her answers was met with silence.The 2020 Democratic presidential contenders seemingly lighthearted appeal came after she responded to a question on how she planned to appeal to middle-class voters from the Midwest who picked Donald Trump in the last election."I guess you look at what I've done, and that is that I am someone that runs in a purple state," Klobuchar said of Minnesota."Every single time I have run, I have won every single congressional district in my state, including Michele Bachmann's."Her answer was greeted with silence.Thats when you guys are supposed to cheer, OK?she said.The CNN town hall was one of five in New Hampshire featuring presidential hopefuls Sens.Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris and South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg were set to follow Klobuchar and field questions directly from students and young New Hampshire Democrats.Klobuchars clap moment was reminiscent of former Republican Florida Gov.Jeb Bushs Please Clap!moment in 2016 during the GOP primary contest for the presidential campaign.
Klobuchar Punts Impeachment Talk: 'I'm the Jury Here':::::Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., was non-committal about whether the House should impeach President Donald Trump saying she would not "predispose" a matter that would be voted in the upper chamber.At a CNN Town Hall on Monday, Sen. Klobuchar said the decision on whether to proceed with impeachment is one that will be made in the House."I believe I'm the jury here, so I'm not going to predispose things," she said."I'm not going to say whether it is or isn't.""The impeachment proceedings are up to the House," she explained."They're going to have to make that decision.I am in the Senate," she said, adding she believes "very strongly that President Trump should be held accountable.""I believe, first of all, we need to have hearings in both the House and the Senate and not just with Attorney General Barr," she said."We need to bring Director Mueller before the United States Senate because otherwise we are never going to get to the bottom of it."Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., was the first Democratic 2020 contender to call for impeachment proceedings against Trump following the Mueller report's release last Thursday.
House Dem Leaders Try to Tone Down Impeachment Talk:::::House Democratic leaders are urging their colleagues to tone down the impeachment rhetoric as it relates to President Donald Trump.During a Monday evening conference call, high-ranking party leaders tried to squash talk of pursuing impeachment at this time.According to The Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and others expressed their concern over jumping on the impeachment bandwagon without concrete evidence Trump might have committed an impeachable offense."We need to hear from [Attorney General William] Barr and [special counsel Robert] Mueller and we need to see the unredacted report and the documents [that] go with it," House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., said."We cannot allow this president to continue going down this course."Other lawmakers said it is time to pursue impeachment."I think we have great evidence that the president has blatantly violated so many laws.It's just ridiculous," Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., said, The Hill reported."I think we have enough" to start the impeachment process.According to CNN's Manu Raju, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said she is still in favor of impeaching Trump but she is not actively trying to recruit other members to join her effort.Mueller recently completed his investigation into Russia interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.He did not find evidence Trump conspired with the Russians to defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton, but he was unable to determine whether Trump obstructed justice.Since a redacted version of the report was released last week, Democrats are pointing to evidence that shows Trump may have tried to interfere with Mueller's probe.
HuffPost Poll: 47% of GOP Says No Trump Campaign Crime:::::Forty-seven percent of Republicans voters believe no one on President Donald Trump's campaign committed any crimes, according to a poll conducted by HuffPost and YouGov.The survey was conducted April 18-19, one day after the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.Mueller, who turned in his report to Attorney General William Barr on March 23, neither charged nor exonerated Trump on obstruction of justice charges and also said neither Trump nor his campaign conspired with Russia to win the 2016 campaign.But the Mueller report states "the president's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the president declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests."The poll also found: 61% of Republicans think the Trump campaign's relationship is not a problem at all.45% of Republicans strongly approve of the job Attorney General William Barr is doing, compared with 45% of Democrats who strongly disapprove.81% of Republicans do not believe Trump attempted to obstruct justice, while 78% of Democrats say he did.The HuffPost/YouGov poll was conducted April 18-19 among 1,000 registered voters and has a margin of error of 3.3 percentage points.
Politico Poll: Trump Approval Dips 5 Points Post-Mueller Report:::::President Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped 5 points since the release last Thursday of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election, a new poll showed.The Politico/Morning Consult survey showed Trump's 39 percent approval rating matches his presidency's low-water mark in the wake of Charlottesville, Virginia, violence in August 2017.There is little support, however, for impeachment, the poll showed.Here are the highlights: 39% of voters approve of the job Trump is doing as president, down from 44% last week.57% disapprove of the job Trump is doing.34% believe Congress should begin impeachment proceedings, down from 39% in January; 48% say Congress should not begin impeachment proceedings.43% say Congress should continue to investigate, while 41% say it should not.46% think the investigation into Russia's influence on the 2016 presidential election was handled fairly, 29% think it was handled unfairly.Further, 48% of Democratic voters, 46% of Republicans, and 43% of independents say they think the investigation was handled fairly.30% approve of the way Attorney General William Barr has handled the case.The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 2 percentage points.
Trump Threatens Crackdown on High Visa Overstay Countries:::::The Trump administration is considering suspending or limiting entry to the U.S. for individuals from countries with high rates of short-term visa overstays a proposal vaguely reminiscent of the controversial travel bans President Donald Trump pursued during his first year in office.In a memo signed Monday, Trump directs officials to examine new ways to minimize the number of people overstaying their business and tourist visas as part of a renewed focus on immigration as the 2020 campaign kicks into high gear.And it says the administration is considering developing "admission bonds" people entering the country would pay a fee that would be reimbursed when they leave in an effort to improve compliance."We have laws that need to be followed to keep Americans safe and to protect the integrity of a system where, right now, there are millions of people who are waiting in line to come to America to seek the American Dream," Trump said in a statement.More people are in the U.S. because they overstay visas than because they cross the border illegally, according to the nonpartisan Center for Migration Studies.Some of the countries with high overstay rates include Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, Liberia, the Solomon Islands, Benin and Burkina Faso.Officials say 20 countries have rates over 10 percent.The memo gives the secretaries of state and homeland security 120 days to come up with recommendations, including potentially limiting how long visas last.The idea of restricting travel from high overstay countries is part of a long list of proposals being tossed around by officials as they try to appease a president who has been seething over the influx of migrants at the border as he tries to make good on his 2016 campaign promises and energize his base going into 2020.The ideas have ranged from the extreme including Trump's threat to completely shut down the southern border and resume the widely denounced practice of separating children from parents to more subtle tweaks to the legal immigration system.Plans are also in the works to have border patrol agents, instead of asylum officers, conduct initial interviews to determine whether migrants seeking asylum have a "credible fear" of returning to their homelands.And the administration has been weighing targeting the remittance payments people living in the country illegally send home to their families and moving forward with plans to punish immigrants in the country legally for using public benefits, such as food stamps.
Cain on Fed Withdrawal: Not a Good 'Trade-Off':::::Herman Cain, the businessman, radio host, and columnist President Donald Trump wanted on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank, said Monday he decided the personal and professional cost was too high.In an opinion piece for the Western Journal, Cain wrote he was well through an arduous vetting process when he realized he would be giving up "too much influence to get a little bit of policy impact.""It was an honor to be considered," Cain wrote."Under different circumstances, I would like to have served.I realize not everyone was a fan of my prospective nomination, and that's OK.I was prepared to make the case for myself, and I was prepared to live with the outcome.""But look: I'm 73 years old and at this stage of my life, I'm doing all the things I want to do," he continued."I can go where I want and say what I want and work with the team I've enjoyed working with for years now.It's remarkable how we've all stayed together and we all enjoy each other still, and I get a lot of joy out of that at this stage of my life.""It's still fun and I do think it's making a difference," he added.The decision was not easy.Cain wrote he not only liked "the idea of serving on the Fed," but was "convinced I could make a positive difference advocating for better growth and monetary policies.""As recently as last Monday I had told President Trump I was all in, and on Friday I was making plans to come to Washington and visit with the senators who were skeptical of my qualifications," he added.He wrote even after publishing an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal that explained his stance on the issues the Fed deals with, "I was prepared to defend these beliefs in meetings with senators and in confirmation hearings.""But the cost of doing this started weighing on me over the weekend," Cain wrote."I also started wondering if I'd be giving up too much influence to get a little bit of policy impact.With my current media activities, I can reach close to 4 million people a month with the ideas I believe in.If I gave that up for one seat on the Fed board, would that be a good trade-off?"The answer was "no."And he jokingly warned not to believe everything written about him."Anything you hear about a reason other than what I've laid out here is (OK, I'll go ahead and say it) fake news," he wrote."They don't have a source.They don't have inside information.Only you do, because I just gave it to you."
House Judiciary Chairman Subpoenas Former White House Counsel Don McGahn:::::House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler on Monday subpoenaed former White House Counsel Don McGahn for testimony following the special counsel's report that said McGahn refused President Donald Trump's request to curb or cut off the Russia investigation.The New York Democrat announced his court action to compel McGahn to testify before the panel and provide documents.According to special counsel Robert Mueller's report, McGahn was among the Trump aides who effectively halted the president's efforts to influence the investigation, rebuffing his demand to set Mueller's firing in motion."The Special Counsel's report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses," Nadler said in a statement."It now falls to Congress to determine for itself the full scope of the misconduct and to decide what steps to take in the exercise of our duties of oversight, legislation and constitutional accountability."The subpoena angered Republicans even as it functioned as a reassurance to impatient Democrats who have called for Trump's impeachment.Nadler released the statement and the subpoena as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a conference call urged rank-and-file Democrats to let the investigative process establish facts before talking up impeachment.Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, pointed out that McGahn sat for 30 hours of interviews with Mueller and said Nadler was asking for some items that he knows cannot be produced.McGahn was a vital witness for Mueller, recounting the president's outrage over the investigation and his efforts to curtail it.He described, for instance, being called at home by the president on the night of June 17, 2017, and directed to call the Justice Department and say that Mueller had conflicts of interest and should be removed.McGahn declined the command, "deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre," the Mueller report said.Once that episode became public in the news media, the president demanded that McGahn dispute the reports and asked him why he had told Mueller about it and why he had taken notes of their conversations.McGahn refused to back down, the report said.Nadler's announcement came as he joined Pelosi on a conference call with rank-and-file Democrats for the first caucus-wide discussion of the Mueller report since it was released on Thursday.In a letter earlier Monday, Pelosi acknowledged that the party's officeholders have a range of views on how to proceed.But she counseled them repeatedly to go after facts, not resort to "passion or prejudice" in the intense run-up to the 2020 presidential and congressional elections.She is the de facto leader of her party until Democrats nominate a presidential candidate."We all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth," Pelosi wrote."It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings."Either way, Trump insisted he wasn't worried."Not even a little bit," he said when asked Monday whether he was concerned about impeachment.However, his many tweets seeking to undermine the report's credibility indicate he is hardly shrugging it aside."Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment," he said Monday on Twitter."There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you can't impeach.It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President!""We must show the American people we are proceeding free from passion or prejudice, strictly on the presentation of fact," she wrote.She added: "Whether currently indictable or not, it is clear that the president has, at a minimum, engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior which does not bring honor to the office he holds."A series of hearings and investigations, particularly in the Democrat-controlled House, is likely to keep in public unflattering details about Trump's behavior provided both by the report and by his former legal fixer, Michael Cohen.Congressional panels are demanding the unredacted version of the Mueller report and its underlying material gathered from the investigation.Attorney General William Barr is expected to testify in the House and Senate next week.And House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., has summoned Mueller to testify next month, though no date has been set.Mueller's report last week described in vivid detail episodes in which Trump is said to have dispatched allies to fire Mueller, shut down his investigation and lie.The strength of the findings kicked off a struggle among Democrats over what to do now show restraint and investigate, or try to impeach?Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Julian Castro, a former Housing and Urban Development secretary, are for impeachment proceedings.Other Democratic candidates, including Sens.Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, have suggested it is too soon.New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, asked if she'd support moving forward given a possible roadmap by the Mueller report, said in a phone interview Monday that she wants more information.It remains to be seen how many Democrats will get on the impeachment bandwagon.The issue has split the party since the day the new Congress was sworn in.That January night, freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was recorded using a profanity to tell supporters the Democrats were going to impeach Trump.After Mueller's report was released, the most prominent of the Democratic freshmen, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, signed on to Tlaib's resolution calling for an investigation into Trump's conduct and the question of whether it merits a formal charge in the House."Mueller's report is clear in pointing to Congress' responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President," Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.
Trump Opens Easter Egg Roll with Talk of Economy, Military:::::Taking part in one of the oldest White House traditions, President Donald Trump blew a whistle and sent spoon-wielding kids into a frenzy Monday as they used the wooden utensils to coax hard-boiled eggs to the finish line during the annual Easter Egg Roll."This is 141 years that we've been doing this," Trump said, addressing the crowd from the Truman Balcony, where he was joined by first lady Melania Trump before they came downstairs to mingle with guests on the South Lawn."I don't remember the first one," Trump joked of the tradition that began in 1878 under President Rutherford B. Hayes.After blowing the whistle to begin one of many egg rolls taking place throughout the day, Trump joined children seated at a picnic table, where they colored cards for U.S. troops.He appeared to answer a question from a child about the wall the president wants to build along the U.S.-Mexico border."Oh, it's happening.It's being built now," Trump said at the table."There's a young guy just said, 'Keep building that wall.'Do you believe this?He's going to be a conservative someday."The president also talked about the economy and the military, telling the crowd on a sunny morning that "Our country is doing fantastically" and that he is rebuilding the armed forces "to a level we have never seen before."More than 30,000 adults and children were expected to stream through the gates all day for a chance to participate in the main event, rolling eggs across the lawn.Tens of thousands of eggs were donated for the event.Some were given away as "egg pops," hard-boiled eggs on a stick.The first lady added two new activities this year - musical eggs, played just like musical chairs, and hopscotch - to a roster that included a musical stage, an egg hunt, egg and cookie decorating, and multiple photo opportunities, including at a mini presidential lectern.In the reading nook, Mrs. Trump read "The Wonderful Things You Will Be" by Emily Winfield Martin.U.S. military bands provided entertainment.
Rep. Collins Views Less Redacted Muller Report, Slams Dems:::::Rep. Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, viewed the less-redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Monday, saying there is no reason for Democrats not to do the same, the Washington Examiner reported.Select Democrats allowed to see the less-redacted report have refused to do so in protest of how Attorney General William Barr has handled its release.House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler issued a subpoena last week for the full report and its underlying documents, giving the Justice Department until May 1 to turn over the information."With the special counsels investigation complete, I encourage Chairman Nadler and Democrat leaders to view this material as soon as possible - unless theyre afraid to acknowledge the facts this report outlines, Collins said, adding that The reports 182-page look at obstruction questions includes only four redactions in total, and both volumes reinforce the principal conclusions made public last month."Collins also criticized Nadler for making wildly inaccurate claims about the report by saying Mueller made it very clear he wants Congress to reach a determination on whether President Donald Trump obstructed justice, according to The Washington Times.Collins said that isnt true, emphasizing that a plain reading of the report does not at all indicate - let alone make very clear, as you claim - the Special Counsel intended for Congress to decide whether President Trump obstructed justice.In fact, it is the exact opposite.The Democrats who declined the Justice Department's invitation wrote last week in a letter to Barr that Unfortunately, your proposed accommodation -- which among other things would prohibit discussion of the full report, even with other committee members -- is not acceptable.
Speaker Pelosi Warns Dems Against Impeachment 'Prejudice':::::Amid myriad calls for impeachment proceedings from Democrats and those resisting President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is urging Democrats to "show the American people we are proceeding free from passion or prejudice," according to The Hill."While our views range from proceeding to investigate the findings of the Mueller report or proceeding directly to impeachment, we all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth," the Speaker wrote in a letter Monday to Democrats, seeking to curtail rabid partisanship in targeting the president."It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings."After the release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report last week, Democrats' interpreted Mueller's writings to be a "roadmap" for impeachment.Speaker Pelosi's letter stressed to stick to "presentation of fact" and avoid reacting with "passion or prejudice.""As we proceed to uncover the truth and present additional needed reforms to protect our democracy, we must show the American people we are proceeding free from passion or prejudice, strictly on the presentation of fact," her letter concluded, per The Hill.
Trump Defies Mueller Report: 'Nobody Disobeys My Orders':::::President Donald Trump said Monday that nobody disobeys my orders, after special counsel Robert Muellers report detailed numerous examples of aides refusing to follow his commands.CNNs Kaitlan Collins asked Trump if he was concerned that members of his staff may ignore his orders after the Mueller report was made public last week.Trump has derided the Mueller report as crazy while also claiming it totally exonerates him of any crime.Nobody disobeys my orders, Trump responded while walking on the South Lawn during the White Houses annual Easter egg roll.The report states that "The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.An unnamed senior administration official told CNN after the reports release: "that the President makes absurd demands of his staff and administration officials -- who are alarmed by them and reluctant to follow them -- is not only unsurprising but has become the norm.In September of last year, an anonymous senior official in the Trump administration published an op-ed in The New York Times claiming to be a part of a quiet resistance made up of officials working diligently from within to frustrate parts of his [Trumps] agenda and his worst inclinations.
Trump: Cain Has Withdrawn From Consideration for Fed Board Seat:::::President Donald Trump said Monday that Herman Cain has withdrawn from consideration for a seat on the Federal Reserve's board amid a focus on past scandals and doubts about his qualifications for the role.Cain is a former CEO of Godfather's Pizza who dropped out of the 2012 presidential race as he faced allegations of sexual harassment and infidelity.The issues resurfaced after Trump said he intended to nominate Cain to the central bank's board of governors.Trump tweeted Monday that "My friend Herman Cain, a truly wonderful man, has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board.I will respect his wishes."Cain's nomination was all but doomed earlier this month when four Republican senators said they wouldn't vote to confirm him if he were nominated.The GOP holds just a three-seat majority in the Senate.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to say 10 days ago whether the chamber would confirm Cain."There were so many things about (Cain) that were red flags," including his lack of understanding of monetary policy, said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton and longtime Fed watcher.Cain has served on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City but didn't participate in any interest rate decisions in that position.Trump is also considering conservative ally Stephen Moore for a separate vacancy on the Fed's seven-member board.Trump's picks of Cain and Moore raised concerns about the Fed's ability to remain politically independent.Last fall, Cain co-founded a pro-Trump super political action committee, America Fighting Back PAC.It features a photo of the president on its website and says, "We must protect Donald Trump and his agenda from impeachment."The potential nominations surfaced after Trump spent months attacking his pick to lead the Fed, Jerome Powell, and other Fed officials for raising interest rates four times last year.Those rate hikes hurt the stock market and were unnecessary because there was no inflation threat, Trump has said.At a meeting in March, Fed policymakers indicated that they expected to keep rates unchanged this year, a sharp change from December, when they suggested that they would lift short-term rates two more times.The Fed board, along with presidents of the Fed's regional banks, plays a critical role in the U.S. economy, holding meetings to debate and vote on whether to raise their benchmark interest rate.That rate, in turn, affects everything from mortgage rates to the interest rate on auto loans and the interest paid on savings accounts.The Fed typically increases its benchmark rate when it worries inflation is about to accelerate, or cuts it to accelerate growth.Like Moore and Trump himself, Cain has criticized the central bank's policies.In a 2012 Wall Street Journal column, Cain argued that the Fed's low interest rate policies had distorted the value of the dollar.He advocated a return to the gold standard as a way to control inflation, a position that most economists disagree with.Many economic historians argue that the gold standard, which fixes the dollar's value to a specific amount of gold, worsened the Great Depression.Cain dropped out of the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination after allegations that he had engaged in sexual harassment when he led the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s.An Atlanta woman also said she had conducted an extramarital affair with Cain for more than 13 years.Cain called the allegations false but said he had "made mistakes in my life."Before leaving the race, Cain had proposed a "9-9-9" tax plan that called for replacing the current tax system with a flat 9 percent business and individual income tax, and a 9 percent sales tax.
Sen. Ernst: Not Necessary for Mueller to Testify in Senate:::::The Senate Judiciary Committee does not need to hear testimony from special counsel Robert Mueller about his report, because the committee should instead be focusing on confirming federal judges, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said Monday."We have the report, so we can go on from there," Sen. Ernst, a member of the committee told CNN."Really, the House seems all over this.I know that we will continue to work on judges as a primary concern in [the Senate] Judiciary."Ernst also added, when asked if she felt alarmed after seeing Trump's behavior as described in the Mueller report, that "we all know who the president is.He has a brash demeanor, that's about all I can say."Her comments come as House Democrats call for Mueller to testify.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is scheduled to hold a conference call Monday with House Democrats to discuss a strategy following last week's report release.Last week, even before Mueller's report was released, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., asked the special counsel to appear before his committee by May 23, posting on his Twitter account a copy of a letter he sent to Mueller.Sunday, Nadler told NBC News he has not ruled out impeachment but said Congress will "have to hear from" Mueller and Attorney General William Barr first."Some of this would be impeachable," Nadler said about allegations in Mueller's report."Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable."
Hogan Gidley: Dems Should Celebrate Mueller Report:::::White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley on Monday criticized Democrats for being "upset" special counsel Robert Mueller did not return evidence President Donald Trump colluded with Russia to undermine the 2016 presidential election."They should be celebrating the fact that the president was being truthful," Gidley told Fox News' "Fox & Friends.""He was being honest and knew that there was nothing there.No evidence, to corroboration, no collusion.Instead, they are upset about it."He singled out Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., complaining the lawmaker has said he agrees he does not think impeachment is the right choice for now, but he had been telling the United States he had "stone cold evidence" against the president."No one is asking Adam Schiff, 'hey, do you retract this?Do you have the evidence?'"Gidley said."Everyone still takes him seriously.I don't even know how that's possible."Meanwhile, the mood in the White House is "very good," Gidley said, but there remains "some righteous indignation and anger why did this all start in the first place?It completely wasted the American's people's time and money."He also rejected Democrats' argument Trump is putting the Republican Party before the country."The president loves this country," Gidley said."He didn't have to run for president.He was a successful businessman.He has seen how this country has been hurt last eight years economically and ISIS taking over so much of the world.He has come in and changed all of that systematically in two years."
House Oversight's Cummings: No Legal Basis for Trump Lawsuit:::::Elijah Cummings, chairman of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, criticized as "baseless" a lawsuit filed on Monday by President Donald Trump to try to block subpoenas from the committee seeking years worth of financial documents from the president."There is simply no valid legal basis to interfere with this duly authorized subpoena from Congress," Cummings, a Democrat, said in a statement."This complaint reads more like political talking points than a reasoned legal brief, and it contains a litany of inaccurate information."He added: "The White House is engaged in unprecedented stonewalling on all fronts, and they have refused to produce a single document or witness to the Oversight Committee during this entire year.
Harris joins Elizabeth Warren’s call for impeachment:::::Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif, is the latest presidential candidate to join the call for President Donald Trumps impeachment following the release of the Mueller Report.During a televised town hall on Monday night, Harvard University student Karla Alvarado asked Harris if congressional Democrats should reconsider their position on impeachment, something top leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, has repeatedly dismissed.Harris began by declaring that its very clear that there is a lot of good evidence in the Mueller Report that points to obstruction of justice.And although she still intends on beating Trump in the 2020 election, she expressed that Congress should proceed with impeachment.CANDIDATE ASKS CNN'S CHRIS CUOMO TO STOP 'CREEPING' I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment, Harris said.I am also a realist and when I look at what has been happening over the two years and some months since Ive been in the United States Senate, I have also witnessed folks in the United States Congress and in particular the GOP, who have been presented with many reasons to push back against this president and they have not.She later elaborated that while impeachment may pass in the Democratic-controlled House, it would likely not in the Republican-controlled Senate.Last week, Harris expressed caution towards impeachment, saying she wanted to hear from Special Counsel Robert Mueller and really understand what he concluded in his report before moving forward with impeachment.Meanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass, doubled down on her call to impeach Trump at an earlier town hall.GET THE FOX NEWS APP There is no political inconvenience exception to the United States Constitution, Warren told CNN anchor Anderson Cooper.
Piers Morgan: Media and Democrats reaction to Mueller report 'a disgrace':::::DailyMail.com editor-at-large and former CNN anchor Piers Morgan appeared on "Hannity" Monday night where he lambasted Democrats and the mainstream media for their reaction to the Mueller Report's release last week, calling it "a disgrace.""Mueller was the savior, the man on the white horse riding into town to take down President Trump on collusion with Russia, he would be exposed as a traitor and this would be the end of his presidency.And then Mueller report comes out and it turns out it was all nonsense.It was to quote Donald Trump, it was 'fake news,'" Morgan told host Sean Hannity.TOP DEM DISMISSES POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION FATIGUE: 'THE RUSSIANS AREN'T GETTING TIRED' Last week, Attorney General William Barr released a redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report that revealed the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia.Morgan criticized The New York Times, The Washington Post and cable news outlets for pushing the "obstruction of justice" narrative after the Mueller report did not result in charges against the president."We are supposed to believe now that Donald Trump committed repeated obstruction of justice over a crime that he now, as we all know, did not commit?He is trying to obstruct people from investigating something he says he said he didn't do and Special Counsel has confirmed he didn't do.It is ridiculous, it is a farce, it is making a mockery of America," Morgan said.The British television presenter also mocked liberals unable to cope with the fact that Trump beat Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016."The liberals here are refusing to accept results in 2016.'But Hillary won the popular vote.'Who cares?It's not about the popular vote," Morgan said.Morgan also went after his old employer CNN, saying he still had friends there but wondering aloud if they are continuing their coverage for monetary reasons.TRUMP RAILS AGAINST 'BULLS---' IN MUELLER REPORT "I don't know why they have done that other than it gives them a lot of money, I guess.I think it damages their credibility and I wish they weren't doing it," Morgan said.Morgan warned the media and Democrats that if they continue to cover President Trump in the same vein that they are essentially guaranteeing him a second term."If the Democrats, fueled by the media, try to continue to fight this, and I'm telling you what will happen, Donald Trump will get reelected and he will have four more years of this," Morgan said.
Linda McMahon on possible Trump-Bernie matchup: 'I would love to see that':::::The former head of the Small Business Association, Linda McMahon, said Monday that for the economy to continue to grow President Trump must be reelected."We need to re-elect President Donald Trump because he put all of these policies in place.I mean, do we really want to stop this economy and the growth that is going?"McMahon said on "The Story with Martha MacCallum."SOME SANDERS BACKERS UPSET WITH BUTTIGIEG McMahon, who last month left the administration, is the chair of the pro-Trump America First Action PAC."I'm just a very practical, common sense person, when I'm out looking across the country and I see the positive impact that the president's policies have had, I'm going 'why do we want the stop this?"McMahon added saying she was 100 percent behind the president.McMahon didn't seem too worried about a matchup with Democratic presidential candidate frontrunner Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and was asked by guest host Ed Henry about a possible general election featuring pro-capitalist Trump versus Democratic socialist Sanders."I would love to see that," McMahon said."Because I really do believe Americans, and polls show, that most Americans do believe in capitalism and not socialism.It's where our country has been founded on, what made our country so successful."SANDERS NABS TOP SPOT IN NEW DEMS POLL AS PETE BUTTIGIEG GAINS MOMENTUM McMahon also touted Trump's vision for America and the economy."I think the president certainly touts that experience as an entrepreneur who built a business and has watched the economy grow here as being president.He's known what to do.He's been a bit disruptive doing it and I think that's why he was elected, " McMahon told Henry.
McConnell vows to be 'grim reaper' of socialist Dem proposals:::::Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, known for years by the hardboiled moniker "Cocaine Mitch," told community leaders in his hometown Kentucky on Monday that he wants a new nickname to reflect what he plans to do to a slew of far-left progressive policy proposals: "grim reaper."McConnell has long framed the upcoming 2020 elections as a referendum on what he has called the "full socialism on display" from prominent Democrat Party members, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and presidential contenders Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Kamala Harris.On Monday, the longtime incumbent was positioning the Senate as a bulwark to defend capitalism, even in the event President Trump doesn't win re-election in 2020."You pass the Green New Deal and Medicare for All, you have fundamentally changed this country, fundamentally changed it into an unproductive place with significant unemployment and huge problems," McConnell told supporters in Owensboro, Kentucky."I don't want you to think this is just a couple of nutcases running around on the fringe.This is pervasive policy view on the other side."NYC MAYOR SAYS GREEN NEW DEAL WILL GET RID OF PESKY GLASS SKYSCRAPERS McConnell added, according to multiple reports: "If I'm still the majority leader of the Senate after next year, none of those things are going to pass the Senate.They won't even be voted on.So think of me as the grim reaper.None of that stuff is going to pass.None of it."McConnell brought Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal resolution to a vote in the Senate in March, and it did not secure a single affirmative vote from Democrats, who charged that the the move was a stunt.McConnell later admitted in an interview with Fox News' "Special Report with Bret Baier" that the vote was indeed "for show."But it would be a grave mistake, McConnell warned Monday, to underestimate the threat posted by the "pervasive" rise of socialism."We are having a legitimate debate about the virtues of socialism, and I don't want you to think it's just a 28-year-old congresswoman from New York," McConnell said."This is much broader than that.I've got five colleagues in the Senate, five colleagues running for president, who have signed on to the Green New Deal and Medicare For All.""Think of me as the grim reaper."Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell McConnell has also cautioned that Amy Klobuchar, a relative moderate 2020 Democratic contender who has called for a public option instead of universal Medicare, would similarly destroy the private insurance industry and cause major problems for the health care system.McConnell, who first became a senator in 1985, is up for reelection in 2020, and he formally launched his campaign last week by emphasizing his work on tax cuts and federal judicial confirmations.CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have reportedly sought to recruit a challenger, despite apparent long odds.Earlier this year, Matt Jones, a Kentucky sports radio personality who has weighed a bid against McConnell, told reporters that he wanted to see a new face in office.Somebody in Kentucky has got to step up and do this," Jones said."And it will be a huge challenge, this guy is almost impossible to beat, but its possible."Last month, a campaign to enlist former figher pilot Amy McGrath to run against McConnell began fundraising.There is incredible grassroots energy for Amy McGrath to run against Mitch McConnell, Ryan Aquilina, who runs the Ditch Mitch project, said at the time.We had one of our best days ever in terms of fundraising, and that proves in no uncertain terms just how much appetite there is for Amy to run and to defeat Mitch McConnell."
Reporter's Notebook: Why House Dem leaders can't wreck the freshmen's 'homecoming float':::::Back when I was in high school, a couple of upperclassmen got in big trouble for going out late one night and trashing the freshman class homecoming float.Homecoming was a big production at my rural high school.A few weeks before the big day, each class would usually scope out a barn somewhere and begin tricking out a hay trailer with every piece of crepe paper available in southwestern Ohio.This would be the genesis of a class float for the homecoming parade.But in my junior year, vandals ruined the freshman homecoming float.People were mad.But it surprised nobody.After all, it was only the freshman homecoming float.Certainly, the freshmen werent going to defile the junior or senior homecoming float.They were lowly underclassmen.It was only natural that upperclassmen would tear up the freshman float.After all, they were just freshmen.DEM LEADERS REJECT IMMEDIATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS IN URGENT CONFERENCE CALL You wouldnt blame senior House Democrats for occasionally wanting to trash the House freshman homecoming float.After all, the left-wing messages of Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., seem to capture most of the attention in the press much to the dismay of other voices in the House Democratic Caucus.But House Democrats know they cant rip up the homecoming float of the freshmen.Thats because the politics of many House Democrats are far more moderate than those of Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, Omar and others.Democrats don't have control of the House because they won those dark-blue districts in New York, Michigan and Minnesota.Democrats are now in the majority because of freshmen most Americans have never heard of: Reps. Abby Finkenauer, D-Iowa, Ben McAdams, D-Utah, Haley Stevens, D-Mich., and Xochitl Torres Small, D-N.M., to name a few.These Democrats are more tempered in their views.They represent swing districts.They flipped their seats from red to blue in the last election cycle.And party elders know they have to keep these seats in Democratic hands or risk a return to the minority.This is why Democrats can't wreck the freshman float.The freshmen are too valuable, even if a particularly small minority of those freshmen are the ones who capture the headlines.CONWAY: TRUMP CAN'T BE IMPEACHED BY AN INVESTIGATION DEMOCRATS STARTED This reflects the current Democratic conundrum with the Mueller Report.Some liberal Democrats believe the report clears them to move to impeach President Trump.More moderate Democrats aren't so sure.The Mueller report not only revealed some of Trumps deceitful behavior but exposed chasms between House Democrats over how to proceed in the post-special counsel world.This is why House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., reiterated to her caucus in a letter Monday that House Democrats will "conduct oversight over the other branches of government."Not exactly a full-throated endorsement of impeachment.That's why Pelosi immediately pivoted in her missive to call out the GOP.CHRIS STIREWALT: IMPEACHMENT TALK PUTS DEMOCRATS IN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION "Congressional Republicans have an unlimited appetite for such low standards," Pelosi wrote of Trump's comportment as spelled out in the Mueller Report."The GOP should be ashamed of what the Mueller Report has revealed, instead of giving the President their blessings."Pelosi must walk down both sides of the street, simultaneously jabbing the President and his Administration to say nothing of Congressional Republicans without doing anything to damage her freshman class and new majority.In her letter, Pelosi wrote that Democrats were committed to finding the "truth."Thats why House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., authorized a subpoena for former White House Counsel Don McGahn to testify and provide documents about what he told Mueller.Nadler announced the subpoena moments before House Democrats jumped on the Monday conference call to discuss their options now that the Russia investigation is complete.WHY THE MUELLER REPORT COULD TURN INTO A NEVER-ENDING STORY ON THE HILL The release of the Mueller report in the middle of a two-week Congressional recess for Easter and Passover may have hindered the ability of Democrats control the narrative.Trump could thunder on Twitter there was "no collusion" and "no obstruction," Game of Thrones style.It would have been easier for Democrats to counter Trump's narrative had lawmakers been roaming the Capitol.But the timing of the report's publication may have been a blessing in disguise for Democrats.The absence of Democrats in Washington muted internal schisms over what would come next.So this is the likely path for Democrats: Lots of hearings.Attorney General William Barr is slated to appear at Senate and House sessions next week.Then a likely appearance by Mueller.Possible testimony by McGahn later in May.The trick for Democrats is to continue chipping away at the president, undercutting him going into 2020 yet not to impeach.Such a strategy might not be everything liberal Democrats want.But it could mildly satisfy the appetite of the base as they attempt to pummel the President.Moreover, such a scheme would protect many of the vulnerable House Democrats mentioned above especially freshmen from battleground districts.That said, there is a risk that the public could interpret repeated inquests into various aspects of the Mueller report as harassment.That could distract from the Democrats honed message of health care and infrastructure.But its not impeachment.If it is what we need to do to honor our responsibility to the Constitution if thats the place the facts take us, thats the place we have to go, said Pelosi on the conference call.We dont have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts, the presentation of facts.No wonder Trump told reporters Monday he was not even a little bit worried about impeachment.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP So, Democrats will kinda-sorta-maybe-perhaps-talk-about-impeachment-but-not-rule-it-out any time soon.Republicans will rail against this ploy as though Democrats are aiming for the jugular.But rank-and-file Democrats, especially freshmen, will enjoy a few layers of protection.Pelosi needs all her new members on board with the gambit.Liberals and moderates.Those from safe districts.Those from liberal epicenters.All new majorities in the House refer to their freshman as "majority makers."So, this "tweener" ploy is just for them, regardless of their politics.And thats why the freshman homecoming float will remain intact for now.
Bernie Sanders says Boston Marathon bomber, sexual assaulters should be allowed to vote:::::2020 presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday defended his stance for granting voting rights to criminals in prison, including the Boston Marathon bomber and convicted sexual assaulters.During a CNN town hall on Monday night, Harvard student Anne Carlstein asked if his position would support enfranchising people like Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who she noted is a convicted terrorist and murderer, as well as those convicted of sexual assault, whose votes could have a direct impact on womens rights.Sanders first responded by saying he wanted a vibrant democracy with higher voter turnout and blasted cowardly Republican governors who he said were trying to suppress the vote.The Vermont senator then argued that the Constitution says everybody can vote and that some people in jail can vote.5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT SEN. BERNIE SANDERS If somebody commits a serious crime- sexual assault, murder, theyre gonna be punished.They may be in jail for 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, their whole lives.Thats what happens when you commit a serious crime, Sanders elaborated.But, I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy.Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away and you say, That guy committed a terrible crime, not gonna let him vote.Well, that person did that.Not gonna let that person vote, youre running down a slippery slope.So, I believe that people who commit crimes, they pay the price.When they get out of jail, I believe they certainly should have the right the vote, but I do believe that even if they are in jail, theyre paying their price to society, but that should not take away their inherent American right to participate in our democracy.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP CNN anchor Chris Cuomo pressed the Democrats' frontrunner, asking him if he was sure about that since he effectively was writing an opposition ad.Sanders dismissed such concerns, saying he'd written many 30-second opposition ads throughout his life.This is what I believe.Do you believe in democracy?Do you believe that every single American 18 years of age or older who is an American citizen has the right to vote?Sanders continued.This is a democracy.Weve got to expand that democracy and I believe that every single person does have the right to vote.
Klobuchar has 'please clap' moment, says CNN's Chris Cuomo 'creeping' over shoulder during town hall:::::2020 presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., saw a couple of viral moments during a televised town hall on Monday night.The first: what critics and analysts have called her please clap moment.Klobuchar was boasting that in each of her elections she won every congressional district in her state, including that of former Rep. Michele Bachmann, a Republican.After the audience didnt react to her victories, Klobuchar gave them permission to be excited.Its when you guys are supposed to cheer, okay?Klobuchar grinned, which prompted applause and some laughter.Many on social media have drawn comparisons to former Florida Gov.Jeb Bush, who famously told a town hall crowd to please clap on the campaign trail during the 2016 election.STIREWALT: TRUMP SUPPORTERS UNFAZED BY MUELLER REPORT RELEASE Later on, the Minnesota Democrat had an awkward encounter with CNN anchor and town hall moderator Chris Cuomo.While discussing how to address climate change with rural voters, Klobuchar stressed how important it was and told Cuomo that she wanted to finish her thought before he interrupted.She then, however, felt a little creeped out by Cuomos presence.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I feel you creeping over my shoulder, Klobuchar told the CNN anchor.She jokingly clarified, not in a Trumpian manner.Klobuchar was referring to the second presidential debate in 2016.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton later accused then-candidate Donald Trump of being a creep for approaching behind her on the debate stage and claimed her skin crawled in her memoir, What Happened.
Stirewalt: Trump supporters unfazed by Mueller release, 'he didn't exactly run as Pope Francis in 2016':::::As a handful of top Democrats have called for the impeachment of President Trump, Fox News digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt noted Monday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report may not sway the American people as the president's opponents might expect.And, the question here is, would the American people countenance an impeachment.And, the answer is probably no, because there's nothing that anyone who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 could have read in the Mueller report, scuzzy as much of it was, unsettling as much of it was, that wasn't already baked into their consideration of Donald Trump, Stirewalt said on Special Report with Bret Baier.Stirewalt was discussing the most important question to ask for those considering impeachment of President Trump, saying pursuing that route was a nonstarter.TOP DEM DISMISSES POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION FATIGUE: 'THE RUSSIANS AREN'T GETTING TIRED' He didn't exactly run as Pope Francis in 2016, right, people knew a lot of this kind of stuff about his character before he ran, that's why I think it is a nonstarter, Stirewalt told Bret Baier.House Democrats backed off the idea of immediately launching impeachment proceedings against Trump in a conference call Monday evening, amid a growing rift among the party's rank-and-file members, presidential contenders and committee chairs on the issue.Two senior sources told Fox News that on the conference call, House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters, D-Calif., told her fellow Democrats that while she personally favored going forward with impeachment proceedings, she was not pushing for other members to join her.Washington Examiner chief political correspondent Byron York also noted that the timing of impeachment would make the political climate crazy.TRUMP RAILS AGAINST 'BULLS---' IN MUELLER REPORT One last thing that the leadership is aware of, the timing of this will be crazy.If the Democrats start now, it will take a while to rev up the impeachment machine, and when they get going, we will be smack in the middle of a presidential election campaign where the impeachee is running for reelection, York said Monday.Doing this in the middle of a campaign would put the whole process on steroids.It's crazy enough to begin with.The leadership is very worried about just the unpredictable aspect of that.Fox News' Bret Baier, Mike Emanuel and Gregg Re contributed to this report.
Rep. Doug Collins: 'Democrats don't seem to like an attorney general who knows how to do his job':::::The top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee told Fox News on Monday night that Democrats attacking Attorney General William Barr for his handling of the Mueller report are "going to try and take down the attorney general so that nobody will believe him.""The Democrats don't seem to like an attorney general who knows how to do his job," Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., told "The Story with Martha MacCallum.""And I think what he has done is his job ...He's credible, he's done what he said and the Democrats are still desperately searching for a reason to paint and smear this president."Collins spoke to Fox News hours after reading a less-redacted version of the Mueller report at the Justice Department, making him the only known lawmaker to accept Barr's offer to view the more detailed version of the report in private."There's nothing, as I said after I read the less-redacted report, that changed the conclusions, changed nothing about what Bob Mueller ... found out," Collins told Ed Henry."Not Bill Barr.Bob Mueller did these investigations.He was the one that came up with the reports.He was the one that said no charges on obstruction.He was the one that said definitively no collusion by anyone or Americans in working to do this."CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP "Maybe they [Democrats] were more used to [Eric] Holder and [Loretta] Lynch, who sort of obfuscated, hid behind executive privilege and did stuff to tear away from the fabric of the American people instead of Attorney General Bill Barr, who's actually done his job," Collins elaborated, referring to former attorneys general under President Obama.Barr is scheduled to testify before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees at the beginning of next month.Fox News' Ed Henry contributed to this report.
Ilhan Omar claims US forces killed 'thousands' of Somalis during 'Black Hawk Down' mission, resurfaced tweet shows:::::A resurfaced tweet from Rep. Ilhan Omar saw the Minnesota Democrat claim U.S. forces killed thousands of Somalis during the 1993 Black Hawk Down mission -- despite multiple analysts concluding the number was much smaller.In the October 2017 tweet discovered by journalist John Rossomando, Omar was responding to a Twitter user who'd highlighted that more than a dozen U.S. soldiers were killed and another 73 were wounded in the Battle of Mogadishu, saying it was the worst terrorist attack in Somalia history.Omar, a Somali refugee who was then a Minnesota state representative, refuted the tweet, insisting that thousands of Somalis were killed by American forces.In his selective memory, he forgets to also mention the thousands of Somalis killed by the American forces that day, Omar tweeted.She also included the hashtag, NotTodaySatan.The number of Somali casualties in the Battle of Mogadishu is widely disputed.A representative of the Somali National Alliance estimated that only 133 militiamen were killed during a 2001 interview while Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War author Mark Bowden estimated roughly 500 Somalis were killed.As the Investigative Project on Terrorism also noted, the Rand Corporation reported that about 300 civilians were killed while others estimated nearly 1,000.OMAR CALLS WHITE HOUSE ADVISER STEPHEN MILLER A 'WHITE NATIONALIST' Critics went after Omar after her tweet resurfaced.Omars office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.This was just the latest controversy surrounding the freshman congresswoman.Omar was condemned by congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle for various tweets that were considered anti-Semitic.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP More recently, she took heat including from President Trump for a line in a speech she gave to the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR).She said, in her defense of the organization, that CAIR was founded after Sept. 11, 2001, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties.CAIR formed in 1994.Critics said her line some people did something was insulting to victims of the terrorist attacks.
Investigation ongoing, House subpoenas ex-White House lawyer:::::WASHINGTON (AP) - A House chairman subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn as Democratic leaders moved to deepen their investigation of President Donald Trump while bottling up talk among their rank-and-file of impeaching him.Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler was one of six powerful committee leaders making their case on a conference call Monday with other House Democrats late in the day that they are effectively investigating Trump-related matters ranging from potential obstruction to his personal and business taxes.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged divided Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment proceedings after the damning details of special counsel Robert Muellers report.Nadler and the other chairmen made clear they believe Trump did obstruct justice, according to people on the call who werent authorized to discuss it by name.McGahn would be a star witness for any such case because he refused Trumps demand to set Muellers firing in motion, according to the report.The Special Counsels report, even in redacted form, outlines substantial evidence that President Trump engaged in obstruction and other abuses, Nadler said in a statement released as the conference call got underway.It now falls to Congress to determine for itself the full scope of the misconduct and to decide what steps to take in the exercise of our duties of oversight, legislation and constitutional accountability.The subpoena angered Republicans even as it functioned as a reassurance to impatient Democrats.Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, pointed out that McGahn sat for 30 hours of interviews with Mueller and said Nadler was asking for some items that he knows cannot be produced.Trump himself insisted he wasnt worried.Not even a little bit, he said when asked Monday whether he was concerned about impeachment.However, his many tweets seeking to undermine the reports credibility indicate he is hardly shrugging it aside.Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment, he said Monday on Twitter.There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you cant impeach.It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President!On the other end of the scale, Pelosis approach disappointed some Democrats who are agitating for impeachment proceedings.According to her spokesman, Rep. Val Demings of Florida said she believed the House has enough evidence to begin the process.McGahn was a vital witness for Mueller, recounting the presidents outrage over the investigation and his efforts to curtail it.The former White House counsel described, for instance, being called at home by the president on the night of June 17, 2017, and directed to call the Justice Department and say that Mueller had conflicts of interest and should be removed.McGahn declined the command, deciding that he would resign rather than trigger what he regarded as a potential Saturday Night Massacre, the Mueller report said.Once that episode became public in the news media, the president demanded that McGahn dispute the reports and asked him why he had told Mueller about it and why he had taken notes of their conversations.McGahn refused to back down, the report said.Nadlers announcement was one of several leadership moves aimed at calming a struggle among Democrats to speak with one voice about what to do in light of Muellers startling account of Trumps repeated efforts to fire him, shut down his probe and get allies to lie.After Muellers report was released last week, the most prominent of the Democratic freshmen, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, signed on to Rep. Rashida Tlaibs resolution calling for an investigation into Trumps conduct and the question of whether it merits a formal impeachment charge in the House.Muellers report is clear in pointing to Congress responsibility in investigating obstruction of justice by the President, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.On Monday, Pelosis letter made clear there was no Democratic disagreement that Trump at a minimum, engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior which does not bring honor to the office he holds.But she acknowledged the partys officeholders have a range of views on how to proceed.She counseled them repeatedly to go after facts, not resort to passion or prejudice in the intense run-up to the 2020 presidential and congressional elections.She is the de facto leader of her party until Democrats nominate a candidate to challenge Trump, so her words echoed on the presidential campaign trail.We all firmly agree that we should proceed down a path of finding the truth, Pelosi wrote.It is also important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment hearings.As the conference call got underway, Nadlers subpoena announcement was made public, an indication that the facts-first approach was moving ahead.Pelosi, calling from New York City, spoke briefly.Then she put a show of leadership force on the line - six committee chairmen, some of the most powerful people in Congress - to give more details, according to people on the call.Nadler went first.Others who followed were Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings, intelligence committee Chairman Adam Schiff, Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel, Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Water and Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal.The call lasted about 90 minutes and included about 170 Democrats.During a series of town hall events on CNN Monday night, several 2020 Democratic presidential candidates weighed in.Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren repeated her call for an impeachment vote, saying that if lawmakers believe the presidents actions were appropriate, they should have to take that vote and live with it.Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Trump should be held accountable, but she stopped short of calling for impeachment.Theres more coming to keep Trumps reported misdeeds in public.Congressional panels are demanding the unredacted version of the Mueller report and its underlying material gathered from the investigation.Attorney General William Barr is expected to testify in the House and Senate next week.Nadler has summoned Mueller to testify next month, though no date has been set.In the face of the intense run-up to the 2020 election, Pelosi implicitly suggested Democrats resist creating episodes like the one in January in which Tlaib was recorded declaring the House would impeach Trump.We must show the American people we are proceeding free from passion or prejudice, strictly on the presentation of fact, Pelosi wrote.___ Associated Press Writers Eric Tucker, Mary Clare Jalonick and Will Weissert contributed to this report.___ Follow Kellman on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/APLaurieKellman Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

Sri Lanka arrests 40 suspects after Easter bombings:::::COLOMBO, Sri Lanka As a state of emergency took effect Tuesday giving the Sri Lankan military war-time powers, police arrested 40 suspects, including the driver of a van allegedly used by suicide bombers involved in deadly Easter bombings and the owner of a house where some of them lived, officials said.Sri Lankas president gave the military a wider berth to detain and arrest suspects powers that were used during the 26-year civil war but withdrawn when it ended in 2009.The death toll from Sundays attacks rose to 310, police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara said.On Tuesday, which President Maithripala Sirisena declared a day of mourning, Sri Lankan authorities planned to brief foreign diplomats and receive assistance from the FBI and other foreign intelligence-gathering agencies after officials disclosed Monday that warnings had been received weeks ago of the possibility of an attack by the radical Muslim group blamed for the bloodshed.The six near-simultaneous attacks on three churches and three luxury hotels and three related blasts later Sunday were the South Asian island nations deadliest violence in a decade.The government blocked most social media to curtail false information.Even after an overnight, nationwide curfew was lifted, the streets of central Colombo remained mostly deserted and shops closed as armed soldiers stood guard.Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he feared the massacre could unleash instability and he vowed to vest all necessary powers with the defense forces to act against those responsible.In an indication of the tensions, three explosions caused panic but apparently no injuries Monday as police were defusing bombs inside a van parked near one of the stricken churches.Dozens of detonators were discovered near Colombos main bus depot, but officials declined to say whether they were linked to the attacks.At Bandaranaike International Airport outside of Colombo early Tuesday morning, police walked explosive-sniffing dogs outside as inside cheery video advertisements of gamblers and snorkelers played.At a roadside checkpoint at the airport, security officials checked car trunks and questioned drivers.The lack of social media access was contributing to the confusion and doing little to reassure residents and visitors that the danger had passed.International intelligence agencies had warned that the little-known group, National Thowfeek Jamaath, was planning attacks, but word apparently didnt reach the prime ministers office until after the massacre, exposing the continuing political turmoil in the highest levels of the Sri Lankan government.Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the warnings started April 4, the defense ministry wrote to the police chief with information that included the groups name and and police wrote April 11 to the heads of security of the judiciary and diplomatic security division.Sirisena, who was out of the country Sunday, had ousted Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in October and dissolved the Cabinet.The Supreme Court reversed his actions, but the prime minister has not been allowed into meetings of the Security Council since October, leaving him and his government in the dark about the intelligence.It was not immediately clear what action, if any, was taken after the threats.Authorities said they knew where the group trained and had safe houses, but did not identify any of the suicide bombers, whose bodies were recovered, or the two dozen other suspects taken into custody.All the bombers were Sri Lankans, but authorities said they strongly suspected foreign links, Senaratne said.Also unclear was a motive.The history of Buddhist-majority Sri Lanka, a country of 21 million including large Hindu, Muslim and Christian minorities, is rife with ethnic and sectarian conflict.In the 26-year civil war, the Tamil Tigers, a powerful rebel army known for using suicide bombers, was finally crushed by the government in 2009 but had little history of targeting Christians.Anti-Muslim bigotry fed by Buddhist nationalists has swept the country recently, but there is no history of Islamic militancy.Its small Christian community has seen only scattered incidents of harassment.Two of the stricken churches are Catholic and one Protestant.The three hotels and one of the churches, St. Anthonys Shrine, are frequented by foreigners.Tourism Minister John Amaratunga said 39 foreigners were killed, although the foreign ministry gave the figure as 31.The reason for the discrepancy wasnt clear, but some victims were dual nationals.India and Britain have confirmed eight dead each.The U.S. State Department confirmed that at least four Americans dead and several seriously wounded.Others were confirmed to be from Bangladesh, China, France, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and Australia.The scale of the violence recalled the worst days of the civil war, when the Tamil Tigers, from the ethnic Tamil minority, sought independence from the Sinhalese-dominated, majority Buddhist country.The Tamils are Hindu, Muslim and Christian.The six near-simultaneous blasts were set off Sunday morning at St. Anthonys and the Cinnamon Grand, Shangri-La and Kingsbury hotels in Colombo, as well as the two churches outside Colombo.They collapsed ceilings and blew out windows, killing worshippers and hotel guests, and leaving behind scenes of smoke, soot, blood, broken glass, screams and wailing alarms.The military confirmed two other related blasts, one near an overpass and another at a guesthouse where two people were killed.A ninth blast, which killed three police officers, was set off by occupants of a safe house trying to evade arrest, authorities said.A morgue worker in Negombo, outside Colombo, where St. Sebastians Church was targeted, said many bodies were hard to identify because of the blasts.He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the archbishop of Colombo, said at least 110 of the dead were killed at St. Sebastians, making it the deadliest of the attacks.Nilantha Lakmal, a businessman who took his family to St. Sebastians for Mass, said they all escaped unharmed, but he remained haunted by images of bodies being taken from the sanctuary.Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the archbishop of Colombo, said the attacks could have been thwarted.We placed our hands on our heads when we came to know that these deaths could have been avoided.Why this was not prevented?he said.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Pete Buttigieg says Donald Trump deserves impeachment at CNN town hall:::::MANCHESTER, N.H. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg says President Donald Trump has made it pretty clear that he deserves impeachment, but he will leave it to the House and Senate to figure that out.The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate was asked about the call from some people in his party for Trumps impeachment following the release of special counsel Robert Muellers redacted report looking into connections between Russia and Trumps 2016 campaign as well as obstruction of justice.Mueller found no evidence of conspiracy between Russia and the Trump campaign but reached no verdict on obstruction.Buttigieg says, My role in the process is trying to relegate Trumpism to the dustbin of history.He continued: And I think there is no more decisive way to do that, especially to get Republicans to abandon this deal with the devil they made, than to have just an absolute thumping at the ballot box for what that represents.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Migrant funding proposal put before Albuquerque City Council:::::ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) - An Albuquerque city councilor is proposing a $250,000 emergency fund for the city to assist migrants released by the U.S. Border Patrol.The resolution sponsored by City Councilor Pat Davis on Monday proposes funding a full-time Office of Immigrant & Refugee Affairs position for an asylum services coordinator.If approved, the money also would fund contracts with non-profits, faith-based organizations and other groups to provide medical services, showers, clothing, toiletries and shelter for migrants.The proposal follows a decision in Las Cruces for the southern New Mexico city to spend $75,000 on humanitarian aid amid an influx of international asylum seekers.Citing local officials, the Las Cruces Sun-News reports that federal authorities have dropped off more than 1,700 asylum seekers in the city since April 12.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Migrants anxious after Mexican authorities raid caravan:::::PIJIJIAPAN, Mexico (AP) - Central American migrants hoping to reach the U.S. now carry the added anxiety of the pursued after Mexican police and immigration agents detained hundreds in a surprise raid on a caravan in Mexicos south.While their compatriots were been taken into custody Monday, hundreds of other migrants scrambled away into the brush along the highway in Chiapas state to elude authorities.Many had already learned they would not be received in towns with the same hospitality that greeted previous caravans, and now they know they wont be safe walking along the rural highway either.Mexican authorities detained hundreds in the largest single raid on a migrant caravan since the groups started moving through the country last year.Oscar Johnson Rivas fled up a mountain when officers converged on the caravan and spent six hours hiding in the thick vegetation before carefully making his way back to the highway with others.Some migrants, including women and children, remained in hiding without food.What we did was find the bush and get as far away as we could so they couldnt grab us, said Rivas, a 45-year-old soldier from El Salvador who said he had to flee his country because of gang threats.They were grabbing us mercilessly, like we were animals, he said of the Mexican officials.Thats a barbarity, because were all human.Police targeted isolated groups at the tail end of a caravan of about 3,000 migrants who were making their way through Chiapas, Mexicos southernmost state.As migrants gathered under spots of shade in the burning heat outside the city of Pijijiapan, federal police and agents arrived in patrol trucks and vans and forcibly wrestled women, men and children into the vehicles.The migrants were driven to buses, presumably for subsequent transportation to an immigration station for deportation processing.As many as 500 migrants might have been picked up in the raid, according to Associated Press journalists at the scene.Some women and children wailed and screamed during the detentions on the roadside.Clothes, shoes, suitcases and strollers littered the scene after they were taken away.Agents had encouraged groups of migrants that separated from the bulk of the caravan to rest after some seven hours of trudging along the road, including about half of that under a broiling sun.When the migrants regrouped to continue, they were detained.Agents positioned themselves at the head of the group and at the back.Some people in civilian clothing appeared to be participating in the detentions.After seeing others being detained, some migrants began walking in dense groups and picked up stones and sticks.Officials from Mexicos National Human Rights Commission observed the action from a distance.The National Migration Institute did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mexico welcomed the first migrant caravans last year, but the reception has gotten colder since tens of thousands of migrants overwhelmed U.S. border crossings, causing delays at the border and angering Mexican residents.The U.S. also has ramped up pressure on Mexico to do more to stem the flow of migrants.President Donald Trump railed against the government of his Mexican counterpart, Andrs Manuel Lpez Obrador, and threatened to shut the entire border down, but then quickly congratulated Mexico for migrant arrests just a few weeks ago.Mexico already allows the United States to return some asylum seekers to Mexico as their cases play out.And government officials said in March they would try to contain migrants in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in the south.It is Mexicos narrowest area and the easiest to control.Pijijiapan and Mapastepec are not far from the isthmus narrowest point, which is in neighboring Oaxaca state.In recent months Mexican authorities have deported thousands of migrants, though they also have issued more than 15,000 humanitarian visas that allow migrants to remain in the country and work.A group of about 10 prominent social organizations recently warned that detentions of migrants have been rising and accused immigration agents and federal, state and local police of violating their human rights.The groups said the increased detentions have overwhelmed capacity at the immigration center in Tapachula.The National Human Rights Commission also said the facility is overcrowded.In its most recent statement from last week, the Migration Institute said 5,336 migrants were in shelters or immigration centers in Chiapas, and over 1,500 of them were awaiting deportation.The Rights Commission said Sunday that more than 7,500 migrants were in detention, at shelters or on the road in Chiapas.It urged authorities to carry out a proper census of the migrants and attend to their needs, particularly children.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Argentines return to Europe to escape economic uncertainty:::::BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) - Tomas Ruiz embraced his father one last time at the Buenos Aires airport before he boarded a plane in search of a new life in Ireland.His sister recently did the same when she moved to Spain.Like many other young Argentines, the siblings hold European passports by descent, and they are returning to the home countries of their grandparents - far from Argentinas sizzling inflation, high unemployment and sharp currency depreciation.My countrys situation prompted me to take this decision, Ruiz said as he finished packing his bags for his trip to Dublin surrounded by photos of his family and friends on the wall.It was a constant frustration to live constantly on the edge, barely making it to the end of the month.Ruiz studied gastronomy and was employed as a cafe manager in Argentinas capital.But even when he worked extra shifts, he couldnt manage to save money, and for months he had been living with his mother to save on rent.Outside his room, family members left him and his sister farewell messages on a chalkboard.I love you and Ill miss you, his mother wrote.Others said: The best is yet to come, and Carpe diem, Latin for seize the day.Its not the first time Argentines have sought shelter in Europe in times of economic uncertainty.Hundreds of thousands emigrated to the old continent to escape hyperinflation in the early 1990s and an economic meltdown in 2001 and 2002.Now, Argentines are losing purchasing power to a nearly 50% annual inflation rate - one of the worlds worst.Many have also protests President Mauricio Macris decision to cut subsidies, leading to a spike in the costs of utilities and public transportation.Last year, the Argentine peso lost more than half its value to the U.S. dollar following a run on the local currency, causing the government to seek a record $56 billion bailout loan with the International Monetary Fund to try to come out of the recession.As a result of the economic crisis and the devaluation, more young professionals are thinking about a future in Europe, said Alejandro Servide, director of professionals and recruitment process outsourcing at Argentinas branch of Randstad, the worlds second-largest staffing company.As part of the austerity measures aimed at balancing the budget, Macris administration has laid off thousands of government workers and slashed funding for dance, science and other programs.Hundreds recently protested outside the headquarters of the National Scientific and Technical Research Council, Argentinas main agency for science and technology.The science sector is suffering because these budget cuts ordered by Macri endanger the continuity of scientific activity, said Alberto Kornblihtt, a molecular biologist.This is undoubtedly contributing to a brain drain that weve suffered at other times (of crisis) in our country.There are no official statistics available on how many Argentines have moved to Europe.Argentinas immigration directorate said it is nearly impossible to keep track of the number because Argentines leaving the country dont have to provide information on their destination or how long theyll stay.But academics, research groups and consulting firms agree there has been a rise in the number of people leaving, especially among young, educated Argentines - just as there was during the nations worst crisis 17 years ago.Back then, millions were plunged into poverty, more than 20 percent of the population became unemployed and many reportedly went hungry in a country that is one worlds biggest producers of beef, soy and wheat.When Argentina goes through these profound crises, people search for options, and just like it happened in 2001-2002 when nearly 800,000 Argentines went abroad, today were living through perhaps the initial phase, said Ariel Gonzalez, executive secretary of the Center for International Studies at the Catholic University of Argentina.That means that theres a sector of society - the middle and high class professionals - who are eyeing a Plan B, which is that if the crisis deepens, one of the options would be to go abroad.Servide said Randstad Argentina carries out about 160 daily interviews for surveys.One of the questions they ask is whether if given the chance, they would be interested in living abroad.About 80 percent tell you yes, he said.Manuel Miglioranza, a 26-year-old lawyer, is moving next month to Toulouse, France.Although he doesnt have dual Argentine-French nationality, hes going to take French lessons and find a job through a temporary work permit allowed through a treaty between the two nations.The economic situation in Argentina is not helping.You cant progress unless you work for the state or you have dollars, he said.I know many people who are leaving.Millions of Europeans flooded into Argentina in the 19th century to escape war and poverty back home, which has been a source of pride for the country.Argentina gave peace to those who were escaping war, freedom to those escaping religious persecution, and bread and work to those escaping hunger, said Horacio Garcia, director of Argentinas National Migration Directorate.Of the last six presidents, four of them were first-generation sons of immigrants, Garcia noted.Their fathers came to Argentina with a cardboard suitcase, and they saw that their children in a short amount of time became presidents of the nation.That hardly happens anywhere else in the world.By the 20th century, a strong workforce along with export earnings from agricultural products and beef had helped turn Argentina into one of the wealthiest countries in the world.Argentines were also among the most Europeanized and educated people in Latin America, Gabriela Nouzeilles and Graciela Montaldo write in their anthology The Argentina Reader: History, Culture and Politics.Their literacy rate (about 90 percent) was the highest by far.Until 1945, the country boasted the highest per capita income on the continent, the most extensive urbanization, the largest middle class, as well as the best newspapers, universities, and publishing houses.But political mismanagement and lower prices for agricultural products that form the countrys economic backbone have for decades led to cyclical booms and busts.The Spanish government recently launched an initiative that allows a limited number of descendants of Spaniards living in Argentina without a Spanish passport to seek a special three-month work visa.Once they find a job, they can request Spanish nationality and bring their families.There were 76,328 Argentines officially registered by mid-2018 in Spain.There are many, many Argentines living here.Were like pigeons - everywhere, quipped Paz Pucheu, an Argentine now living in Spain.The 25-year-old radio and television announcer went to Barcelona in 2017 when things got really complicated in Argentina.She began working at a restaurant and eventually landed a job at a local radio station.Like other Latin American countries, Argentina was a Spanish colony.With friends now we joke around that were colonizing our colonizers, she said.__ Associated Press journalists Paul Byrne and Demian Bio in Buenos Aires, Aritz Parra in Madrid and Renata Brito in Barcelona, Spain, contributed to this report.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Pete Buttigieg walks back Bernie Sanders, Trump comparison:::::MANCHESTER, N.H. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg says Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and President Donald Trump are stupendously different in very, very many respects as he tried to smooth over an earlier comparison of the two politicians.At a CNN town hall in New Hampshire on Monday night, Buttigieg noted that anti-establishment energy can find its way in a number of very different political directions.He says recent history shows that voters arent just focused on are you close to me on a left-right political spectrum.Rather, he said, they want to know: Are you really going to profoundly change the system that were living in?Sanders and Buttigieg are among the Democrats seeking the partys nomination to take on Trump in the 2020 election.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Pete Buttigieg blasts Bernie Sanders' push to let criminals vote from prison:::::MANCHESTER, N.H. Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg says he doesnt believe convicted criminals in prison should be able to vote.The South Bend, Indiana, mayor said Monday at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire that part of the punishment when someone is convicted of a crime is losing certain rights.That stands in stark contrast to the position taken earlier Monday by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who said he believes felons even including people like Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev should be able to keep their right to vote.He says the right to vote is inherent to our democracy.Yes, even for terrible people.California Sen. Kamala Harris said she thinks we should have that conversation about whether convicted criminals like Tsarnaev should be able to keep their right to vote.Tsarnaev killed three people and injured hundreds in 2013 with a pair of pressure-cooker bombs and was sentenced to death.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Pete Buttigieg: illegal immigrants welcome in South Bend:::::South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg on Monday said he that he didnt know if he ran a sanctuary city but the police force doesnt enforce federal immigration laws.I regard us as a welcoming city.Some conservative talk show host may say that makes us a sanctuary city.I dont know, he said during a town hall-style forum hosted by CNN in Manchester, New Hampshire.He said South Bend welcomed all people regardless of whether they are in the country legally.The president thinks America is full.Were not, he said, adding that he supported a path to citizenship for the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. Mr. Buttigieg, who has surged into the top tier of the Democratic presidential candidates, said police in his Indiana town were too busy to deal with immigration enforcement.We make it very clear that our South Bend police department is not responsible for enforcing federal immigration policy, he said.Indiana does not permit sanctuary cities.South Bend does not qualify as a sanctuary according to criteria used by the Center for Immigration Studies, a low-immigration advocacy group.Mr. Buttigieg also said that getting South Bend law enforcement agencies involved in immigration enforcement would hamper policing in communities with large immigrant populations.Residents there would be hesitant to report crimes or cooperate with investigations if they believe police are conscripted by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), he said.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.Click here for reprint permission.
Pete Buttigieg on lack of policy specifics: Don’t ‘drown people in minutia”:::::MANCHESTER, N.H. South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is addressing questions about his lack of policy specifics, saying he thinks hes been pretty clear about where he stands on the major issues.At a CNN town hall Monday night in New Hampshire, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate says he thinks its important that candidates dont drown people in minutia before they show the values that animate our policies.He says Democrats sometimes have a habit of doing that.He says, We go right to the policy proposals and we expect people to be able to figure out what are values must be from that.Buttigieg is the fifth of five candidates to appear in the CNN town hall events Monday.He was preceded by Sens.Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Kamala Harris of California.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Kamala Harris open to Bernie Sanders Boston Marathon bomber vote from prison idea:::::Sen. Kamala Harris, California Democrat, said Monday that she was open to the possibility of allowing the Boston Marathon bomber and other convicted criminals and terrorists to vote while imprisoned.Ms. Harris made the comments in the fourth of five back-to-back town-hall meetings CNN gave several of the leading 2020 Democratic presidential-primary contenders.Before her, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont offered a full-throated defense of letting criminals vote while imprisoned, not ducking from including convicted Islamist terror-bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.With Ms. Harris on the stage, CNNs Don Lemon asked her what she thought of that idea.The former prosecutor initially parried the question, calling voting a right people should not be stripped of needlessly and saying that state laws that take away voting rights from freed felons racist.But Mr.Lemon persisted, asking about people currently in prison or on death row.I think we should have that conversation, Ms. Harris said.Mr.Lemon replied, OK, all right and broke for a commercial.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.Click here for reprint permission.
Kamala Harris says she would take executive action on gun violence:::::MANCHESTER, N.H. Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris says she would take executive action on gun violence if Congress fails to pass comprehensive gun safety measures in her first 100 days in office.The senator from California appeared Monday at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire along with four other 2020 candidates: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (BOO-tuh-juhj).Harris says her executive actions as president would include near-universal background checks by anyone who sells five or more guns annually; revoking the licenses of gun manufacturers and dealers that break the law; reversing President Donald Trumps change to the definition of fugitive from justice; and closing a loophole to prevent dating partners convicted of domestic violence from buying guns.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Kamala Harris says Congress should start Trump impeachment at CNN town hall:::::Sen. Kamala Harris on Monday said she backed impeachment proceedings against President Trump, saying the Mueller report showed very good reason to do it.There is an investigation that has been conducted that has produced evidence that tells us that this president and his administration have engaged in obstruction of justice.I believe Congress should take the steps toward impeachment, the California Democrat said during a town hall-style forum hosted by CNN in Manchester, New Hampshire.Capitol Hill Democrats have wrestled with the impeachment question since special counsel Robert Muellers report cleared Mr. Trump of colluding with Moscow to interfere in the 2016 election but left open the question of whether he attempted to obstruct Mr. Muellers Russia probe.Ms. Harris follows her Senate rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, in supporting impeachment.Others in the crowded field of Democrats have been more circumspect about impeachment proceeding.Still, Ms. Harris called herself a realist about the long odds against impeachment ending with the Senate voting to remove Mr. Trump from office.If the Democrat-majority House passes articles of impeachment, it would require 67 of 100 senators to vote in favor of removing Mr. Trump from office.Ms. Harris said that she has too often seen Senate Republicans ignore what she described as wrongdoing by Mr. Trump and instead protect him.We need to get rid of this president.Thats why Im running for president, she said.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.Click here for reprint permission.
Bernie Sanders says Benjamin Netanyahu racist on CNN town hall:::::MANCHESTER, N.H. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is standing by his criticism of Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying the U.S. goal in the Middle East must be to try to bring people together and not just support one country, which is now run by a right-wing, dare I say, racist government.Sanders said Monday at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire that he believes the United States should deal with the Middle East on a level-playing-field basis.The senator from Vermont says he is not anti-Israel but feels Netanyahu is a right-wing politician who is treating the Palestinian people extremely unfairly.Sanders then added that he is 100% pro-Israel and that the country has every right in the world to exist and to exist in peace and security and not be subjected to terrorists attacks.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Bernie Sanders says Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, felons should vote from prison at CNN town hall:::::Sen. Bernard Sanders on Monday said he wanted prison inmates to vote in elections, including convicted Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy.Yes, even for terrible people, Mr. Sanders said at a town hall-style forum hosted by CNN in Manchester, New Hampshire.Mr. Sanders said he took that position despite knowing it could be turned against him by his rivals in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.Restricting voting rights, even for a convicted murderer and terrorist such as Tsarnaev, he said would be a slippery slope toward undermining American democracy.Tsarnaev was convicted of the al Qaeda-inspired bomb attack on the 2013 Boston Marathon that killed three people and wounded 260 others.Mr. Sanders said restricting voting rights was the type of policy currently pursued by cowardly Republican governors seeking to suppress the vote.SEE ALSO: Amy Klobuchar finds herself in several awkward moments during CNN town hall Mr. Sanders, an icon of the far left who calls himself a democratic socialist, is a frontrunner in the Democratic race.He said there were other punishments for criminals that did not include disenfranchisement.If somebody commits a serious crime, sexual assault, murder, they are going to be punished.They may be in jail for 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, their whole lives.Thats what happens when you commit a serious crime, he said.But I think the right to vote is inherent to our democracy.Yes, even for terrible people, because once you start chipping away, and you say, That guy committed a terrible crime, not going to let him vote you are running down a slippery slope.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.Click here for reprint permission.
Elizabeth Warren doubles down on Trump impeachment at CNN town hall:::::MANCHESTER, N.H. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is doubling down on her call to impeach President Trump in the wake of the release of the redacted Mueller report and is calling on every lawmaker in the House and Senate to vote on the presidents fate.The 2020 Democratic presidential candidate said Monday at a CNN town hall in New Hampshire: If there are people in the House and the Senate who want to say thats what a president can do when the president is being investigated for his own wrongdoings or when a foreign government attacks our country, then they should have to take that vote and live with it.Warren said earlier in the town hall that if any other human being in this country had done whats documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
Elizabeth Warren at CNN Town Hall says private prisons should go:::::MANCHESTER, N.H. Massachusetts Sen.

Jerrold Nadler Trump investigation impresses far-left Democrats:::::Rep. Jerrold Nadler was not the champion the new left wanted, but he quickly proved to be the one it needed in the hunt to impeach President Trump.As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler has launched a sweeping corruption investigation of the president, spearheaded demands to see the full Mueller report and seems unafraid to explore impeachment.The vigorous pursuit of Mr. Trump impressed the new breed of far-left lawmakers and activists who have taken hold of the Democratic Party.They often eye with skepticism the old guard leaders such as Mr. Nadler, a long-serving New York liberal whose district includes Wall Street.It seems like he is the right person at the right time a sturdy hand on the rudder, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which leads the charge of what it calls the partys Elizabeth Warren wing.Other old-school liberals such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts disappointed the partys new generation by not aggressively pushing its far-left agenda.Many of the fights within the Democratic Party right now are not just relegated to progressive Democrats versus conservative Democrats, but in many cases it is the more senior, long-serving members versus those with a more immediate finger on the pulse of where the public is on issues like the Green New Deal or Medicare for All, Mr. Green said.Among the longer-serving members, Jerry Nadler is more in touch and willing to be bolder than some others, he added.On Monday, Mr. Nadler subpoenaed former White House counsel Don McGahn, saying he is a critical witness on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice.He also has issued a subpoena demanding the unredacted 448-page report by special counsel Robert Mueller and the underlying evidence he collected investigating suspected collusion between Mr. Trumps campaign and Russian officials.He said he saw plenty of evidence of obstruction of justice, which is the Democrats chief argument for impeachment after the report cleared Mr. Trump of conspiring with the Kremlin.Obstruction of justice, if proven, would be impeachable, he said on NBCs Meet the Press.Mr. Nadler, 71, has been in politics his entire adult life.He has spent the past quarter century in Congress representing his Manhattan district.Though a dyed-in-the-wool traditional liberal, he always has seemed to know where his party is moving and kept pace with it.When the Occupy Wall Street protest began in 2011 with the takeover of New Yorks Zuccotti Park, Mr. Nadler sided with the ragtag demonstrators and against his infuriated constituents in the financial district.The main thing is whats going on.This is a national issue, not a neighborhood issue, he told The Washington Times back then.When President Obama needed support for the Iran nuclear deal, Mr. Nadler was the only Jewish member of the New York delegation to endorse the deal, which critics said would doom Israel.His support was considered pivotal, and Mr. Obama personally lobbied him.Despite severe criticism, he went on to garner 89% of the vote over a primary challenger who made the Iran nuclear deal a top issue.Mr. Nadler received his liberal pedigree at an early age when his fathers New Jersey chicken farm failed.I started becoming politicized when I was growing up because there were two names that were never pronounced except with disdain, Mr. Nadler told The New York Times in 1992 when he was elected to the House.One was Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the other was Ezra Taft Benson, his secretary of agriculture.I didnt know what they did, but whatever they did made it impossible for chicken farmers to produce eggs without losing money.He entered the political fray in 1977, serving as a member of the New York General Assembly while going to law school at night.A year later, he earned his law degree.As a New York politico, Mr. Nadler had run-ins with Mr. Trump.In the 1980s, when Mr. Nadler was an assemblyman, he opposed Mr. Trumps plan to build the worlds tallest skyscraper on the Upper West Side.Mr. Trump nicknamed him Fat Jerry.Mr. Nadler, who is 5 feet, 4 inches tall, struggled with obesity for most of his life.By the early 2000s, he had reached 338 pounds and was unable to climb a single flight of stairs at the Capitol.After undergoing stomach-reduction surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan during Congress summer recess in 2002, Mr. Nadler eventually cut his weight in half and has kept it off.A skilled lawyer and politician, Mr. Nadler emerged as a formidable opponent for Mr. Trump.The chairman is regarded as someone who knows not only the immense reach but also the precise limits of congressional authority to extract information from the executive branch.He is especially suited to think through serious problems and not make false steps.This is a very thoughtful, deliberate man, said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant in New York who has known Mr. Nadler for decades.Whatever you see is not off the cuff.Whatever you see is very thoughtful and measured, he said.And he has a history of not liking Donald Trump, as does anybody who was an elected official on the Upper West Side in the years when Trump was building his massive project over the rail yards.The chairman also is not new to impeachment.Mr. Nadler watched with disdain as the Republican-led House impeached President Clinton.This is a partisan coup detat that will go down in infamy in the history of our nation, he said in the House debate of the articles of impeachment in 1998.Mr. Speaker, this is clearly a partisan railroad job.Back then, Mr. Nadler also argued against the release of the full report by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starrs investigation of Mr. Clinton.He protested revelation of grand jury testimony, including salacious material, that he said may not be true.The full Starr report was made public.Mr. Nadler now is arguing on the other side of the issue for the report by Mr. Mueller, though changes in the law have made it unlikely that an unredacted version will be released.In 2006, Mr. Nadler urged his Justice Committee colleagues to explore impeachment of President George W. Bush over his authorization of domestic surveillance without court review.The issue was on a long list of grievances that Democrats said warranted impeachment.But the congressman ultimately backed Democratic leaders who decided in 2007 that it was too close to the election and the end of Mr. Bushs final term to bring up articles of impeachment.This time, Mr. Nadler said he wont leave a stone unturned in search of evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Trump.He will do it by the book, methodically and with unrelenting determination, according to those who know him.Were going to see where the facts lead us, Mr. Nadler said.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.Click here for reprint permission.
Amy Klobuchar CNN town hall has several awkward moments:::::MANCHESTER, N.H. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has found herself in several awkward moments during her CNN town hall.Klobuchar has been trying to show her sense of humor during the televised appearance but quickly drew social media attention Monday night for the moments, including one on prescription drugs in which she evoked 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.Klobuchar says, We should bring in less expensive drugs from other countries like Canada.We can see practically see Canada from our porch when were up here.At another point, after noting her electoral success in purple-state Minnesota, she quipped, Its when you guys are supposed to cheer, OK?She also referenced a notable moment during a 2016 presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, saying she could feel town hall anchor Chris Cuomo creeping over my shouldernot in a Trumpian manner.Copyright 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
DC Heads to 100% Renewable Energy, a Symbolic Move for the Country:::::As the Trump administration moves to dismantle federal laws to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Washington, D.C., is working to bring renewable energy to the White House and the rest of the city.Under a law approved in December, the District of Columbia will require that all of its electricity come from renewable sources by 2032, the most ambitious timetable in the country.Federal buildings would be included."Its doable, it works, its not some pie-in-the-sky idea," said Mark Rodeffer, the chairman of the Sierra Clubs Washington, D.C., chapter, which backed the law."In 13 years, the U.S. Capitol is going to be powered by electricity that is 100 percent from wind and solar.At the same time, some climate deniers in the Capitol are going to be saying this is impossible to do, but theyre going to be saying that under lights that are powered by wind and solar, disproving the argument that theyre making."Washington, D.C., has the tightest deadline, but it follows the lead of Hawaii and California, both of which earlier committed to 100 percent clean energy by 2045.Hawaii, the most petroleum-dependent of the 50 states, acted in 2015 and California, a leader in environmental advances, voted last fall.More than 100 cities also have have pledged to move to completely clean, renewable energy, and a half a dozen smaller ones have already reached that goal, according to the Sierra Club.Pollen Problems: How Climate Change Supersizes Allergy Season Climate change is changing pollen production patterns and impacting everyone with seasonal allergies.Take a deeper look at the problem and see what you can do to help fight off the coughing and sneezing.(Published Monday, April 22, 2019) Cities account for more than three-quarters of primary energy use but also are the most vulnerable to power disruptions linked to climate change, notes C40 Cities, a network of the worlds mega-cities that are addressing climate change.Ninety percent of all urban areas are on a coast, at risk from flooding from rising sea levels and powerful storms.Seventy percent of cities are already seeing the effects of climate change.When Donald Trump was elected president, questioning whether climate change was real and promising he would gut attempts to cut carbon emissions, officials looked for ways to keep environmental progress headed forward.Absent a strong federal presence, cities, states and companies have taken the lead.One of Trumps early policy decisions as president was to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, a worldwide attempt to confront climate change.In response, D.C. has banded together with New York, Los Angeles and other C40 cities to meet the agreement's goals primarily to keep the global temperature increase this century to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and to try to limit the temperature rise even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius."The residents of Washington, D.C., expect local government to provide leadership to mitigate global warming," said Tommy Wells, the director of the Districts Department of Energy and Environment.The goal is to make the city carbon neutral by 2050.The Clean Energy D.C. Act of 2018 is expected to cut emissions in half by 2032.By 2041, 10 percent of the electricity must come from solar facilities located in the District of Columbia or within the area of the regional transmission organization that serves the District, PJM Interconnection.PJM Interconnection coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in the District, Maryland, Virginia and all or parts of 11 other states.Climate Change Could Change Cost, Taste of Beer New research says climate change is brewing trouble for the beer industry.Storm Team4 Meteorologist Amelia Draper explains the impact on the cost and taste of beer.(Published Thursday, March 14, 2019) The act also encourages the purchase of electric vehicles and requires that all public transportation and privately owned fleet vehicles to become emissions-free by the year 2045.It strengthens energy efficiency standards for new and existing buildings, which account for 74 percent of Washington D.C.'s greenhouse gas emissions.The District is the first jurisdiction to mandate buildings meet energy performance standards, which will be based on federal energy efficiency criteria, Wells said.Within five years every building must create a plan for meeting the standards, or the District will impose one.A green energy bank, funded with up to $100 million, will help multi-family buildings with affordable housing, he said.The new requiremens are meant to bring additional, clean energy production online -- solar and wind though not nuclear power and hydropower -- and to move the district's electricity supplier away from purchasing energy credits in favor of long-term contracts."Its a matter of supply and demand," Rodeffer said."People will build more wind and solar farms because the demand is increasing.So that will expand renewable energy production, which is what this is all about."Activists are hoping other municipalities and states will follow the lead of the nations capital.Marylands General Assembly passed a bill earlier this month that mandates half of the states electricity supply comes from renewable sources by 2030.Republican Gov.Larry Hogan vetoed a similar bill in 2016, but Democrats overrode his veto to set the current goal of 25 percent.Marylands secretary of the environment, Benjamin Grumbles, said this week that the governors office was reviewing the new bill.Since California passed its 100 percent renewable electricity standard last year, at least nine states, including Connecticut, Illinois, Maine and New York, were considering similar proposals, The Los Angeles Times noted.The biggest challenge facing California is its reliance on natural gas.Global Student Walkout to Demand Action on Climate Change Hundreds of thousands of students in more than 100 countries skipped school Friday to demand action on climate change.Kids in more than 1,200 cities across the globe are protesting a failure of governments to cut greenhouse-gas emissions.The Fridays for Future rallies were one of the biggest international climate change actions yet.(Published Friday, March 15, 2019) Renewable energy now provides just a small percentage of electricity to customers who get their electricity from D.C.'s primary electricity supplier, Pepco Holdings -- which is about 84 percent of its 308,000 customers.The remainder purchase their energy through an alternative supplier.For the first six months of last year, renewable energy was the source of just 5.8 percent of the District's electricity.Renewable energy credits, certificates that can be traded, made up the difference of a 16.5 percent renewable requirement.The source of most of the District's electricity was nuclear at 35.3 percent, followed by coal at 29.8 percent, natural gas at 28.7 percent, and oil at 0.3 percent."Weve been taking the stand for a long time now that climate change is real, we have to act, we have to act urgently, and we have to use all available carbon-free technologies that we have at our disposal today and we should be creating policies that encourage innovative and that allow us to take advantage any new carbon-free technologies that develop tomorrow," said Pepcos senior vice president of governmental and external affairs, Melissa Lavinson."Our focus is on carbon and carbon reduction, what investments are needed, what can we do, what can others do and how can we work together to most expeditiously and affordably achieve our climate change goals."The need to act was heightened by last years report from the United Nations scientific panel on climate change, which warned that the immediate consequences would be much worse than thought.The report, the first commissioned under the Paris agreement, describes wildfires, a mass die-off of coral reefs and food shortages if the worlds economy was not changed at an unprecedented speed.NASA Scientist Uses Comedy to Talk Climate Change Josh Willis is an accomplished NASA scientist, but his night job is using comedy to spark the conversation on climate change.Belen De Leon and Tommy Bravo report for NBC4 News at 11 p.m. on April 7, 2019.(Published Monday, April 8, 2019) The Fourth National Climate Assessment, a separate report by 300 federal and non-governmental agencies that was released on Black Friday, outlined the real-time effects of climate change across the U.S., broken down by region."Americans increasingly recognize the risks climate change poses to their everyday lives and livelihoods and are beginning to respond," the report said.Economists such as Noah Kaufman, a researcher who works on energy and climate change policy at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, favor a national approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.Climate change is a global problem which should be tackled at the highest levels of government, he said."Its also really important to make sure that we are reducing emissions cost effectively because if were serious about deep emissions cuts, getting to a truly low carbon economy, that implies a real transformation of our energy system which means big changes to our economy," said Kaufman, a former deputy associate director of energy and climate change at the White House Council on Environmental Quality under President Barack Obama."I think were kidding ourselves if we think thats going to be easy or cheap."Kaufman acknowledged the constraints to passing climate change policy in todays political climate, particularly a new tax.Mike Tidwell, the founder and director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, a grassroots nonprofit organization focused on Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C., called the Districts electricity goals a new bar for the rest of the country on climate action."Its one

NY-Based Artist Displays 'Obama Paintings' in Chicago to Highlight Presidential Legacy:::::Over the course of former President Barack Obamas presidency, artist Rob Pruitt took it upon himself to paint a portrait of the politician within the context of a significant event that transpired that day, every day for eight years while he was in office.In honor of the 10th anniversary of President Obamas first inauguration, an exhibit at the Rebuild Foundations Stony Island Arts Bank in Chicago displays a series of "Obama Paintings"a total of 2,922 portraits to be exact.At the end of a presidency, everybody scurries about trying to figure out what that presidents legacy will be.I did not want to highlight big moments moments like the signing of the Affordable Care Act, the Iran Nuclear Deal, or the capture of Osama bin Laden I wanted to depict a very measured, intellectual, capable statesman who showed up to work everyday and led; a leader with a long list of accomplishments we, as a nation, would be proud of.Rob Pruitt The quote above is highlighted in large lettering, front and center inside the exhibit.The artist said the idea was first sparked 10 years ago when Obama was just a candidate.Pruitt said although he doesnt consider himself a political junkie, he was so moved and inspired by Obamas message that he began to sign up for community events near where he resides in lower Manhattan.It was such a thrill when Obama was elected and I thought to myself, what am I going to do with all of this energy from the campaign that I still had?Pruitt explained.It felt to me, like the first time in my lifethat I really connected with a politician.The background of each painting is based on a gradient fade of the American flags colors and Pruitt said each portrait is meant to showcase a dedicated, public servant who showed up to work every day and made important decisions to make sure that all of our health and safety was protected.Pruitt made sure to capture not just the moments while in office, but also the regular, friendly, everyday family man.The "Obama Paintings" debuted Thursday and the new Chicago exhibit is scheduled to run through August 25, 2019.Stony Island Arts Bank is set to host programming in conjunction with the exhibition, according to a statement released, including an artist's talk, workshops, and special performances exploring the relationship between art and civic engagement.All events are free and open to the public.Pruitt said the end goal is not so much about the sale of the paintings but rather preserving the art in a safe space and more importantly, that young individuals and students are able to learn and understand Obama's time in office.I hope that it just reminds each of us of the importance of the presidency and what it means even in our own lives to wake up every morning, to do a good job, he said.

I'm Effed: Trump's Reaction to Mueller's Appointment, Other Top Takeaways From the Redacted Mueller Report:::::A redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report into Russian election meddling and President Donald Trump has been released to Congress and the public.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) A 448-page report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller gives an inside look at Donald Trump's tumultuous campaign and presidency and its possible links to Russians who tried to help win him the presidency.The report says there's not enough evidence to charge Trump with a crime, but it details vague responses to questions and staff members deleting key communications.Here are some key takeaways from the Mueller report, the conclusion of a 22-month investigation that looked at the question of the Russian interference and whether the president tried to obstruct the probe.Trump Cursed When Told of Mueller's Appointment After the special counsel was appointed in May 2017, Trump reacted with anger: Oh my God.This is terrible.This is the end of my Presidency.Im F*****, according to notes from Jody Hunt, the attorney generals chief of staff.Trump then told Jeff Sessions to resign as attorney general.Sessions submitted a resignation letter the next day, but Trump decided to retain Sessions.Trump Demanded Muellers Removal Trump directed White House Counsel Don McGahn in May 2017 to call Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to have Mueller removed as special counsel.Mueller Report: 10 Instances of Possible Obstruction of Justice by Trump Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election included instances of potential obstruction by President Donald Trump.Here is a rundown of the ten mentioned in the report.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) McGahn's clear recollection was that the President directed him to tell Rosenstein not only that conflicts existed but also that Mueller has to go, the report says.McGahn refused the directive and was prepared to resign over it he told then White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus that the President had asked him to do crazy sh*t, according to the report.Mueller was never fired.Trump was told he was under investigation In December 2017, the special counsels office advised the presidents lawyers that Trump was the subject of an investigation although Trump has repeatedly said since that he is not the subject of an investigation.Mueller determined that the Trump campaign had not conspired or coordinated with the Russian government, but the presidents team did think it would benefit from the Russian attempts to publish stolen emails.The report found that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential campaign in what it called sweeping and systemic fashion, and also that the Trump campaign expected to benefit from those efforts."The Campaign expected it would benefit electorally from information stolen and released through Russian efforts, the report said.A Timeline of Muellers Russia Investigation On May 17, 2017, former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to oversee the investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign.He secured the conviction of one Trump associate, guilty pleas from several others and the indictment of Russians who allegedly interfered in the 2016 election.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) Nonetheless the investigation did not establish that member of the Trump Campaign conspired and coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities, the report said.Barr in his letter to Congress reported the last sentence but omitted the sentence that the Trump campaign thought it would benefit from the stolen emails released on WikiLeaks.Barr earlier told Congress that there were two main Russian efforts to influence the presidential election, one involving a Russian organization called the Internet Research Agency, that used social media in the United States to sow social discord, eventually with the aim of interfering with the election, and the second involving the Russian governments efforts to hack into the emails of Hillary Clintons campaign and Democratic party organizations and publish them through WikiLeaks and other groups.According to Rick Gates, a top campaign official, "by the late summer of 2016, the Trump Campaign was planning a press strategy, a communications campaign and messaging based on the possible release of Clinton emails by WikiLeaks."Trump wanted more Clinton emails After Trump, while a candidate, said on July 27, 2016, that he hoped Russia would find the 30,000 emails that are missing, he asked people affiliated with his campaign to find the deleted Clinton emails.Michael Flynn, later his national security advisor, recalled that Trump made this request repeatedly.Flynn contacted many people in try to obtain the emails.Key Moments From Barr's Presser Prior to Report Release Attorney General William Barr addressed the media prior to his department's release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report to Congress.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) The Trump campaign did have "numerous" contacts with Russians The investigation identified two kinds of connections between members of the Trump campaign and the Internet Research Agency one by linking, retweeting or reposting pro-Trump or anti-Clinton content and two by meeting with agency employees posing as Americans to coordinate political rallies in the United States.Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale and Michael Flynn all liked or promoted social posts originally posted by the IRA.If Mueller could have exonerated the president, he would have Mueller wrote that because the members of his team were determined not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, they did not draw ultimate conclusions about the presidents actions and his intent.The evidence they obtained would need to be resolved if it were to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment, the report said.At the same time, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state, the report said.Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgment.Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.Trump associates deleted relevant communications The office said that some of those they interviewed or investigated, including some associated with the Trump campaign, had deleted relevant communications or used encrypted applications that did not provide for long-term retention of data.In those cases the office could not corroborate witness statements or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known facts.Trump Reiterates No Collusion After Release of Mueller Report President Donald Trump said at a White House event for wounded warriors on Thursday that hes having a good day, following the release of special counsel Robert Muellers report.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) Therefore, the special counsels office could not rule out the possibility that the unavailable information would shed additional light on (or cast in a new light) the events described in the report.Trump agreed to respond to written responses on Russian-related questions, but not on obstruction The report notes that Trump did not similarly agree to provide written answers to question on obstruction topics or question on events during the transition.Muellers team sought to interview the president for more than a year, and considered issuing a subpoena for Trump but decided against it because of the likelihood of a long legal battle.Prosecutors also said they believed they had enough evidence and information from other sources to draw "relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility, the report said.The written answers that Trump did provide were not sufficient, according to the report.The President stated on more than 30 occasions that he does not 'recall' or ' remember' or have an ' independent recollection of information called for by the questions.Other answers were incomplete or imprecise,'" the report said.12 mystery cases have been referred to other jurisdictions Two cases that were referred included the case against Trumps longtime associate, Michael Cohen, to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York on financial crimes that he pleaded guilty to and another involving lobbyist Gregory Craig, a White House counsel early in President Barack Obamas administration who has been charged with making false statements about work for the Ukrainian government.But information about 12 other cases were redacted on grounds of harm to ongoing matter.Why were no charges brought after the Trump Tower meeting?Muellers office considered whether to charge Trump campaign officials in connection with a now-infamous meeting at Trump Tower in 2016, which Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and others attended after Trump Jr. was told of an offer from Russias Crown prosecutor of official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to [Trump Jr.'s] father."Trump Jr. responded, if its what you say I love it especially later in the summer.But the lawyer who attended wanted to talk about adoptions and the Magnitsky Act, under which a group of prominent Russians were sanctioned for human rights violations.Prosecutors noted in the report that federal election law bans contributions and donations by foreign nationals but they argued that the special counsels office would have difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the values of the promised documents and information exceeded the $2,000 threshold for a criminal violation or the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment.Although damaging opposition research is surely valuable to a campaign, it appears that the information ultimately delivered in the meeting was not valuable, the report said.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D.-Calif., joined in criticizing Barrs spin.Yet again Attorney General Barr has tried to spin the Mueller report before providing the actual report or the evidence underlying it, Booker tweeted.This is undermining the independence of this entire process.Swalwell later called for Barr's resignation in a tweet and circulated a petition to that end, saying the attorney general acted as President Donald Trump's "defense attorney."Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the early Democratic front-runner for the 2020 nomination, weighed in, calling on Trump and Republican leaders to "stop obstructing the necessary work to protect our democracy.""It is clear that Donald Trump wanted nothing more than to shut down the Mueller investigation," Sanders tweeted."Congress must continue its investigation into Trump's conduct and any foreign attempts to influence our election."Mueller Report: 10 Instances of Possible Obstruction of Justice by Trump Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election included instances of potential obstruction by President Donald Trump.Here is a rundown of the ten mentioned in the report.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) The reports redactions were a cause of concern among 2020 candidates, who said the redacted version of the report was not enough for Congress to conduct meaningful oversight over the investigation into Russian interference and possible ties to the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election.Other presidential primary contenders, including Sen. Kamala Harris of California, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, and even Republican hopeful Bill Weld, joined in calling for Barr to resign and for Mueller to testify on his team's findings.It is essential that Special Counsel Bob Mueller come before Congress and address the validity of his report that has been redacted and released," Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, tweeted.Key Moments From Barr's Presser Prior to Report Release Attorney General William Barr addressed the media prior to his department's release of special counsel Robert Mueller's report to Congress.(Published Thursday, April 18, 2019) On MSNBCs "Morning Joe," Buttigieg called the attorney general's news conference really disturbing.If I were advising a president at a moment like this, I would advise being as transparent as you can, he said.And instead it sounds like what they want to do is describe this thing and then hand it over.Harris said Barr was acting "like Trumps defense attorney" and called his press conference "a stunt, filled with political spin and propaganda.""Americans deserve the unvarnished truth," Harris tweeted."We need Special Counsel Mueller to testify publicly in Congress."Former Texas congressman Beto ORourke, who was canvassing in New Hampshire, was more tight-lipped.As of Thursday mid-afternoon, he had not tweeted about Barr or the Mueller report, and when a reporter asked the candidate to comment, he responded that he didn't have "enough information to share.""But I'm glad that [the report]'s being released, he said.

Brexit: Cross-party talks to resume:::::Image copyright PA The government will resume Brexit talks with the Labour Party as MPs return to Westminster following the Easter break.Cabinet ministers, including the PM's de facto deputy, David Lidington, will meet senior opposition figures in an attempt to solve the Brexit impasse.But the resumption of talks has provoked anger among a number of Tory MPs, with senior backbenchers meeting later to discuss their next move.Meanwhile, Prime Minister Theresa May will chair a cabinet meeting.Tory MP Nigel Evans, a Brexiteer and critic of Mrs May, told the BBC the government's handling of Brexit had been "frustrating" and that "fresh leadership" was needed.Senior members of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, which Mr Evans is a member of, will meet late this afternoon.He said: "She's reaching out to the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn, when she should have been reaching out to the people."It comes after it emerged that Mrs May faces an unprecedented no-confidence challenge from Tory campaigners.More than 70 local association chiefs have called for an extraordinary general meeting to discuss her leadership and a non-binding vote is to be held at the National Conservative Convention EGM.Under party rules, MPs cannot call another no-confidence vote until December 2019.However, if the grass-roots vote showed a lack of confidence - it could put pressure on the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs to find a way of forcibly removing the PM from office.In separate news, Change UK will launch its European election campaign in Bristol, while Nigel Farage's Brexit Party will unveil its candidates in London.The UK has been given an extension to the Brexit process until 31 October.This means the UK is likely to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May.

Donald Trump 'set for June state visit to UK':::::Image copyright AFP Buckingham Palace is expected to announce on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump will make a state visit to the UK in early June.The president was promised the visit by Prime Minister Theresa May after he was elected in 2016 - but no date was set.Downing Street did not comment on the matter when contacted by the BBC.President Trump and the first lady, Melania, visited the UK in July 2018 for a two-day working visit.During the 2018 trip, the president met Mrs May at Chequers and the Queen at Windsor Castle before heading to Scotland, where he owns the Turnberry golf course.The president's last trip to the UK was marked by demonstrations around the UK.In London, thousands of protestors took to the streets to voice their concerns about the visit.And in Scotland, people showed their displeasure both in Edinburgh and at Turnberry.The National Police Chiefs' Council estimated that the police operation for the president's 2018 visit cost nearly 18m.It said 10,000 officers from across the country were needed to cover the occasion.What is a state visit?Image copyright PA Image caption The Queen welcomed President Barack Obama to Buckingham Palace in 2011 A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government.State visits are grand occasions, but they are not just ceremonial affairs.They have political purpose and are used by the government of the day to further what it sees as Britain's national interests.Once the location and dates are confirmed, the government, the visiting government and the royal household will agree on a detailed schedule.So what is involved?The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle.There is usually a state banquet, and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included.The Speaker of the House of Commons is one of three "key holders" to Westminster Hall, and as such, effectively holds a veto over who addresses Parliament.The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state a year.She has hosted 109 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952.The official website of the Queen and the Royal Family has a full list of all state visits since then, including details of how the ceremonies unfold.
The Queen attends an Easter service on her 93rd birthday:::::Image copyright PA The Queen has attended an Easter service at Windsor Castle on the day she celebrates her 93rd birthday.She was presented with flowers and a crowd sang "Happy Birthday" as she left St George's Chapel.In an Easter message, Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK "must stand up for the right of everyone" to practise their faith in peace.And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn compared the experience of Jesus to the challenges facing some refugees today.The Queen was joined for the Easter Sunday service by family members including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke of Sussex.The Duke of Edinburgh, who has retired from public duties, and the Duchess of Sussex, who is heavily pregnant, did not attend.But Prince Harry and Meghan posted a joint birthday greeting to the Queen on Instagram, saying: "Happy Birthday Your Majesty, Ma'am, Granny."As the Queen left the chapel, she was presented with two posies - one yellow and one white - by two boys.Gun salutes will also be fired in London to mark her birthday - although she will have to wait a day, as they are never done on a Sunday.The Queen celebrates two birthdays each year - 21 April is her actual birthday and she also has an official one on the second Saturday in June, which is commemorated with the Trooping the Colour parade.The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, used his Easter message to say the resurrection of Jesus showed "injustice and oppression don't have the last word"."The risen Jesus is the one who makes our broken lives whole," he said.In her Easter message, the prime minister said she will spend her time "giving thanks in church", but for many Christians "such simple acts of faith can bring huge danger".About 245 million Christians worldwide are estimated to be facing persecution.Mrs May, a vicar's daughter and practising Christian, said: "Churches have been attacked.Christians murdered.Families forced to flee their homes."That is why the government has launched a global review into the persecution of Christians."We must stand up for the right of everyone, no matter what their religion, to practise their faith in peace."Image copyright PA Image caption The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arriving at the 14th Century chapel in Windsor Castle Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Duke of Sussex, pictured with Autumn Phillips and Peter Phillips, attended without his pregnant wife The government review, led by the Bishop of Truro, was launched in December to look into how much help the UK gives persecuted Christians.In the Labour leader's Easter message, Mr Corbyn said the experiences of Jesus as a refugee were "still familiar to us today".He said Jesus was "a refugee whose parents were forced to flee their home", who went on to "know what it was to be ostracised, rejected and tortured".He added: "The refugee crisis is a moral test.Jesus taught us to respect refugees."Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mrs May and husband Philip attended a local church for the Easter Sunday service Mr Corbyn also used his message to criticise the government for failing to take in child refugees, as well as Home Secretary Sajid Javid's handling of the Channel migrant crossings over the winter.He said: "In Britain, we have a proud history of providing a safe refuge to those in need.But this government refuses to meet our legal obligations to child refugees in Europe as required by the Dubs Amendment."The Dubs amendment, designed by the Labour peer and former child refugee Lord Dubs, was a scheme which aimed to let unaccompanied migrant children into the UK - but it was not extended by the government in 2017.The Home Office responded by saying that the UK had provided protection to over 34,500 children since the start of 2010 and the government was "determined to deliver on its commitment" to relocating 480 children under the "Dubs amendment".
Brexit: Labour must back another referendum:::::Image copyright Getty Images Labour must promise another Brexit referendum to counter the electoral challenge posed by Nigel Farage, the party's deputy leader has said.Writing in the Observer, Tom Watson said his party could not "sit on the fence" about the biggest issue to face the UK for a generation.But ex-UKIP leader Mr Farage said a new referendum would be "a total insult" to five million Labour Leave voters.The UK has been given an extension to the Brexit process until 31 October.This means the UK is likely to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May.Mr Farage launched his new Brexit Party last week and said it had a list of 70 candidates to fight the May elections.Mr Watson warned that Labour would not defeat Mr Farage "by being mealy-mouthed and sounding as if we half agree with him"."We won't beat him unless we can inspire the millions crying out for a different direction," he added.Voters 'deserve better' He said a "confirmatory" referendum and "final say" on any deal was "the very least" voters deserved, now they knew more about what Brexit would mean.He added: "They deserve a Labour Party that offers clarity on this issue, as well as the radical vision for a new political economy achieved by working with our socialist allies inside the EU."And, above all, they deserve better than Nigel Farage's promise of a far-right Brexit that would solve nothing."However, Mr Farage accused Mr Watson of breaking promises to the British people and said he intended to "wholeheartedly target Labour lies and dishonesty in the weeks ahead".Talks with the Conservatives aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock have re-opened Labour's divisions over a possible further referendum.Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry wrote to cabinet colleagues to warn that striking a deal with the prime minister that ditched the commitment to a public vote would breach party policy.A survey earlier this year found that 70% of Labour members support another referendum, but nine of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's top team are sceptical or opposed.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Nigel Farage described 23 May as the "first step" for his party Mr Farage's Brexit Party also poses a threat to the Conservative Party, according to a survey for the Mail on Sunday.The Survation poll of 781 Conservative councillors found that 40% were planning to back the Brexit Party at the May European elections.Just over half - 52% - said they would vote for their own party.If Brexiteer Boris Johnson was prime minister this figure would rise to 65%, the survey found.Some 15% said they believed Mr Farage would be the best leader of the Conservative Party - only Mr Johnson was ahead of him, on 19%.Analysis By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent Nigel Farage relishes the opportunity to put a cat among the pigeons - and once again the two biggest parties are questioning how to deal with his unambiguous pro-Brexit message.Tom Watson's case is that Labour needs to be different.He's not impressed with the idea of "sounding as if we half agree" with Mr Farage, urging his party to strengthen its message on another referendum and provide a natural home to those on the other side of the Brexit debate.The problem is that some in the Labour completely disagree.They think it would an historic mistake to ignore Labour voters who backed Leave in 2016 and believe it may actually encourage those voters to side with Mr Farage.The Conservatives are grappling with how to fight the European elections too.Today's poll in the Mail on Sunday suggests some Conservative councillors are prepared to turn their back on the party - at least temporarily - and support Mr Farage.That will only feed into fears in the Tory leadership that these elections could be a disaster for the party - and strengthen resolve to try to stop them happening by getting a deal through Parliament.The picture isn't the same everywhere.In Scotland, for example, the pro-referendum SNP appear to be maintaining strong support.But Mr Farage will continue to argue that the main parties have failed to honour the referendum result.And his allies suspect that message will prove a powerful one for Brexit supporters if the European Parliament elections go ahead.Although Theresa May has said she still wants the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible, she is yet to get her withdrawal deal - which has been rejected three times by MPs - approved by Parliament.Cross-party talks between the government and the Labour Party are continuing, to find a way through the impasse.Labour wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, which would allow tariff-free trade in goods.The government has repeatedly ruled out remaining in the EU's customs union, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy.The EU has said the UK must hold elections to the European Parliament in May or leave on 1 June without a deal.Labour's position on Brexit June 2017 -

Huge increase in Public Spaces Protection Order fines:::::Image caption Councils can bring in PSPOs to ban activities such as begging, nuisance drinking and even unauthorised cycling Nearly 10,000 fines for breaches of "petty" council orders were issued in England and Wales in 2018, with a quarter of those in Peterborough alone.Campaign group the Manifesto Club has called for the Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPO) to be scrapped.Councils can bring in PSPOs to ban activities such as begging, nuisance drinking and even unauthorised cycling.The Local Government Association said PSPOs were one way to "tackle anti-social behaviour".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hillingdon councillor David Simmonds "makes no apology" for the fines About 60% of the 9,930 fines were issued by just four councils - Peterborough (2,430), Bedford (1,489), Hillingdon (1,125) and Waltham Forest (966) - which all use private companies to issue the fines.People who do not comply with the orders can be required to pay a 100 fixed penalty.Rosie Brighouse, a lawyer for human rights charity Liberty, said she was concerned some wardens were "acting with incentives to issue as many fines as possible".Peterborough, which uses the private firm Kingdom Services Group to collect fines, issued 1,533 for "unauthorised cycling" in 2018, 861 for spitting, and 13 for "failure to disperse".A Peterborough City Council spokesman said: "The reason Peterborough has more fines is because the PSPO areas cover a larger number of offences, including cycling, littering and spitting."What's been banned?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Slough has banned possession of a slingshot or catapult The Manifesto Club study found: Slough has banned possession of a slingshot, while Pendle introduced a curfew for under-16s Colchester council fined four people for putting up an A-frame Kirklees in West Yorkshire has outlawed fireworks and sky lanterns Three Rivers council, in Hertfordshire, issued 20 fines for school drop-offs Several councils including Derby, Newcastle, Poole, and Barking and Dagenham, issued fines for begging.The Manifesto Club, which uncovered the figures through a Freedom of Information Request, criticised the 420% increase in fines since 2016, when there were only 1,906 issued in England and Wales.Liberal Democrat peer Lord Tim Clement-Jones said: "The shocking rise in petty PSPOs and fines means that thousands of people are being punished for entirely innocuous actions."An LGA spokesman said: "PSPOs are one of a number of ways councils can tackle anti-social behaviour problem."PSPOs will not be suitable or effective in all circumstances, and councils will consider other approaches which may better resolve the anti-social behaviour identified."A Home Office spokesman added: "We are clear PSPOs should be used proportionately to tackle anti-social behaviour."
Facebook bans UK far right groups and leaders:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Former BNP leader Nick Griffin and ex-Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen are among those affected Facebook has imposed a ban on a dozen far-right individuals and organisations that it says "spread hate".The ban includes the British National Party and Nick Griffin, the English Defence League and the National Front.The list also includes Britain First, which was already banned, but this latest action will prohibit support for it on any of the US firm's services.It said it had taken the action because those involved had proclaimed a "violent or hateful mission"."Individuals and organisations who spread hate, or attack or call for the exclusion of others on the basis of who they are, have no place on Facebook," the social network added in a statement.Image copyright Facebook Image caption The pages of some organisations named were still present on Facebook before the announcement The ban includes: The British National Party and its ex-leader Nick Griffin Britain First, its leader Paul Golding and former deputy leader Jayda Fransen English Defence League and its founding member Paul Ray Knights Templar International and its promoter Jim Dowson National Front and its leader Tony Martin Jack Renshaw, a neo-Nazi who plotted to murder a Labour MP A spokesman for Facebook clarified what would now be done to the pages the groups and individuals had run on its site.All those named would be prevented from having a presence on any Facebook service.In addition, praise and support for the groups or named individuals would no longer be allowed.The ban was "long overdue" said MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select committee."For too long social media companies have been facilitating extremist and hateful content online and profiting from the poison," she added."They have particularly failed on far-right extremism as they don't even have the same co-ordination systems for platforms to work together as they do on Islamist extremism," she added.Ms Cooper said the measures were a "necessary first step" and should be strengthened by independent regulation and financial penalties for firms that were sluggish to remove material."We all know the appalling consequences there can be if hateful, violent and illegal content is allowed to proliferate," she said.Image copyright Facebook This current action, said Facebook, went further than the restrictions placed on Britain First last year when its official pages were removed for breaking the site's community standards.The latest move comes soon after Facebook said it would block "praise, support and representation of white nationalism and separatism" on its main app and Instagram.Some controversial figures, such as Tommy Robinson, are already subject to bans on the social network.
Crossrail 'could be delayed until 2021':::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December 2018 Crossrail could be delayed until 2021, according to a senior source associated with the project to build a new railway underneath central London.The east-west route, officially called the Elizabeth Line, will run between Reading and Shenfield in Essex and had been due to open in December 2018.Crossrail said testing of the trains and signalling was "progressing well".But sources told the BBC this phase - known as dynamic testing - was "proving more difficult than was first thought".The source said: "It all depends on how dynamic testing goes between now and the end of this year.""The last quarter of this year will be a critical period for the testing."Signalling software Once dynamic testing is complete then trial runs will commence.This will effectively be a simulation of the timetable in real time.The source said, with the current state of the project in mind, a "best case scenario" would be the new Elizabeth Line opening in spring 2020.A "middle probability case" would be the summer of next year."A worst case is the spring of 2021."Two other senior rail sources say this assessment is credible.It also tallies with one of the conclusions in a report written by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee which was published earlier this month.However, there is still uncertainty over when the scheme can be delivered because work to match a new signalling system in the 13-mile stretch of tunnel with software on the new trains is still ongoing.On top of the trains and signalling, all of the new stations along the route are incomplete.Paddington and Bond Street are the furthest behind.A delay to the project only first became public in the summer of last year, just weeks before the railway was supposed to open in December 2018.What is Crossrail?Image copyright Getty Images Crossrail is a new railway that will run beneath London from Reading and Heathrow in the west through central tunnels across to Shenfield and Abbey Wood in the east.Construction began in 2009 and it is Europe's biggest infrastructure project - it had been due to open in December 2018 although last summer that was pushed back to autumn 2019.It has been officially named the Elizabeth Line in honour of the Queen and will serve 41 stations.An estimated 200 million passengers will use the new undergound line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two.Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes.Roger Ford at Modern Railways magazine said he believed the failure to come clean about the delay was symptomatic of how politically sensitive the project was.Both Transport for London and the Department for Transport are joint sponsors."It was probably a situation where people don't report upwards for fear of getting shot."He said he believed "everyone is to blame" and the fact that the new management had taken several months to assess the scale of the delay "shows how bad it was".Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A drone's-eye view of a flight through Crossrail's tunnels in 2015 If there is a further significant delay it will almost inevitably cost more money.In 2010 the budget for Crossrail was scaled back slightly to 14.8bn.But when the initial delay became public last year that figure rose to 17.6bn.Much of that additional money has been lent to Transport for London by the government.Whitehall officials insist London will ultimately have to cover the extra cost, not UK taxpayers elsewhere.In a statement, Crossrail said London needed the line to be "completed as quickly as possible and brought into service for passengers"."We are working very hard to finalise our new plan to deliver the opening at the earliest opportunity and we will be providing more details later this month."Bombardier which manufactured the trains for Crossrail did not wish to comment on reports that the testing of the trains and signalling was not going to plan.Siemens Mobility is responsible for the signalling.When contacted by the BBC, it referred inquiries to Crossrail.

Brexit: No deal means hard Irish border, says Selmayr:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Martin Selmayr (right) served as Jean-Claude Juncker's chief of staff from 2014 to 2018 One of the European Commission's most powerful officials has said that a no-deal Brexit would mean a hard Irish border.The comments from Martin Selmayr feature in a documentary made by ARTE, the Franco-German broadcaster.The secretary-general of the European Commission was filmed in a meeting with senior MEPs in late 2018."Let's be very clear - if there is no withdrawal agreement there will be a hard border," he told them."This is the worst of all scenarios."So for Ireland this situation would be very tough and that's why we need to do everything to prevent that."'Will not accept hard border' Mr Selmayr was previously chief of staff to Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission.He served in the position from 2014 to 2018.The ARTE documentary The Clock Is Ticking had extensive behind the scenes access to the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and other senior EU figures.In January, the European Commission's chief spokesman said it was "obvious" there would be a hard border in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.At that time the Irish government had repeated its stance that it would "not accept a hard border on this island".Since Mr Selmayr's comments the EU has intensified its no deal planning.Officials have made clear that no deal would mean checks on goods moving from NI to the Republic.However the question of where and how those checks would take place remains open.The Taoiseach has said customs processes could take place away from the border but animals and food products present a more difficult challenge.The EU has strict rules for these products meaning they must be physically checked at a border inspection post.
Extinction Rebellion: Climate protests 'diverting' London police:::::Image copyright PA Image caption About half a dozen activists were arrested in a space of 20 minutes at Oxford Circus Police are being diverted from "core local duties" that keep London safe by the Extinction Rebellion protesters, Scotland Yard has said.More than 500 people have been arrested since Monday, including three charged with gluing themselves to a train.Police rest days have been cancelled over the bank holiday, as more than 1,000 officers are deployed in London.Sajid Javid said the climate activists had "no right to cause misery" and the Met Police "must take a firm stance".Officers have also been asked to work 12-hour shifts, while the Violent Crime Task Force has had leave cancelled."This will have implications in the weeks and months beyond this protest as officers take back leave and the cost of overtime," a Met Police spokesman said.Image copyright PA Image caption Traffic has been blocked at four sites since Monday British Transport Police said it "continues to deploy additional officers throughout the London rail network to deter and disrupt further protest activity".Heathrow Airport said it was "working with the authorities" following threats protesters may try to disrupt flights over the Easter weekend.The Met said "strong plans" were in place to enable a significant number of officers to be deployed to Heathrow if necessary.Police have made further arrests, but activists continue to block traffic at four sites around the capital.Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Waterloo Bridge have been occupied by protesters since Monday.Transport for London warned delays around those areas were expected "throughout the day".Met Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave has said police may need new powers to deal with non-violent protests on this scale, due to the large number of arrestees for police and courts to deal with.Image copyright Extinction Rebellion Image caption Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters at Marble Arch Oscar winning actress and writer Emma Thompson joined protesters, saying it was the "first real hopeful movement I've joined".Speaking from the blockade at Marble Arch, Ms Thompson said: "Our Planet is in deep danger, our grandchildren and our great-grandchildren are going to face problems the likes of which we cannot even begin to imagine."Unfortunately our governments haven't listened to us, so now we have to make them listen."Image copyright PA Image caption Activists remain glued to a boat in the middle of Oxford Circus On Wednesday, a man glued himself to a Docklands Light Railway (DLR) train carriage in Canary Wharf while a man and woman were removed from the roof.Cathy Eastburn, 51, from Lambeth in south London, Mark Ovland, 35 of Somerton in Somerset and Luke Watson, 29, of Manuden in Essex, appeared before Highbury Magistrates' Court charged with obstructing trains or carriages on the railway.They all pleaded not guilty to the charge and will next appear at Blackfriars Crown Court on 16 May.The Met said a total of 10 people had so far been charged in connection with the protests.Some protesters have been seen returning to the blockades despite being arrested.Police action to deter activists was having the "opposite" effect, according to environmental scientist Dominic Goetz who has returned to Waterloo Bridge following his arrest on Tuesday."I don't know whether I will be arrested again or not.If I am, I think the consequences will probably not be particularly severe," the 47-year-old said.Image copyright Reuters Image caption More than 425 people have been arrested since Monday Met chiefs have also condemned footage of officers dancing with protesters.The videos posted on social media, which showed police officers joining activists at Oxford Circus on Wednesday evening, have been condemned as "unacceptable behaviour"."We expect our officers to engage with protesters but clearly their actions fall short of the tone of the policing operation," Cdr Jane Connors said.Image caption Demonstrators have been holding intermittent blockages on Vauxhall Bridge In a letter to the home secretary, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan suggested cuts to police funding were restricting the Met's ability to cope with the demonstrators.A group of demonstrators has been blocking Vauxhall Bridge for short periods of time as part of a "swarming" protest.Similar intermittent roadblocks have also been formed by activists at Piccadilly Circus.What is Extinction Rebellion?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament.It has three core demands: for the government to "tell the truth about climate change"; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress.Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible.But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.
DUP only party that can unite unionism, says Foster:::::Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption The DUP's council election manifesto includes pledges on rates and playparks The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is the only party strong enough to unite unionism, according to Arlene Foster.The DUP leader was speaking at the launch of her party's local government election manifesto in Belfast.She argued that every first preference vote for another unionist party "runs the risk of dividing unionism".She said it also risked "returning fewer unionist councillors" and "bolstering Sinn Fin demands for a divisive" Irish border poll.'No free hits' The DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds rejected the argument that unionists who disagree with his party on social and moral issues or Brexit can feel free to register a protest at the council elections on 2 May.He said that was because the job of Stormont first minister is not at stake.Image copyright Pacemaker Image caption Nigel Dodds warned unionists against lodging a protest vote against the DUP There is "no such thing as a free hit" when it comes to elections, he added.On councils, the DUP commits in its manifesto to what it calls a real-terms cut in rates by keeping any rises below the level of inflation over the full council term.'More inclusive playparks' The manifesto states that there should be further discussion on whether councils should get additional powers to regenerate towns and villages.But it says that if this happened there will have to be improved protections for minorities.It argues that those already in place have proved highly ineffective in protecting unionists in western and border areas.The DUP also wants to see more playparks and leisure facilities made fully accessible for people with disabilities.The party says it is not good enough that while there are nearly 900 playparks, in some council areas only 105 of those facilities have inclusive play equipment.On Brexit, the DUP manifesto states that the UK's vote to leave the EU must be honoured but Northern Ireland cannot be subjected to onerous new trade barriers within the UK.
Conservative MP seeks to oust Commons Speaker John Bercow:::::Image copyright AFP/ Getty Images Image caption John Bercow was elected Speaker in 2009 A Conservative MP is making a fresh attempt to remove John Bercow from his position as House of Commons Speaker.Crispin Blunt has said he will table a motion expressing no confidence in the Speaker when the House of Commons returns from recess on Tuesday.In a statement posted on Twitter, the Reigate MP accuses Mr Bercow of bias over Brexit and overruling precedent on "a number of key votes".The Speaker's office did not provide a comment on the motion.Mr Blunt acknowledged there was "much to admire" about Mr Bercow's near ten-year tenure but "enough was enough" as many MPs had "an unshakeable conviction in his bias on the Brexit issue"."Even his most partisan supporters for the positive changes he has delivered as Speaker do not now seriously dispute his bias in the conduct of our affairs," he said."If colleagues are too cowed or too content with the direction of his bias to state their view on Speaker Bercow's obvious partiality then not only will he feel able to continue... but also exercising the power of his office wholly inappropriately."The essential attribute of his office is now missing.It should not be allowed to continue, not least without anything being formally said."Image caption Mr Blunt said the Speaker had displayed "obvious partiality" Mr Blunt has said he intends to write to MPs seeking their support for an Early Day Motion (EDM) expressing no confidence in the Speaker.The EDM is expected to be tabled on Tuesday when the House of Commons returns from recess - however there is no guarantee that such a motion would be debated.The Speaker, who was elected in 2009, has come in for growing criticism in recent months from pro-Brexit MPs.In January, they accused him of ignoring the advice of his officials about parliamentary procedure over Brexit.Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said his actions were "extremely concerning" but Mr Bercow said he was "not setting himself up against the government but championing the rights of the House of Commons".Following the heated row there were reports the government would block Mr Bercow from getting a peerage - normally accorded to Speakers when they retire.Mr Blunt's move is not the first time MPs have attempted to oust the Speaker.In 2017 Conservative James Duddridge tabled a motion of no confidence, but it was only signed by four other MPs.And two years earlier, he survived a bid by David Cameron's government he survived a bid by David Cameron's government to change the rules on electing Commons speakers - a move seen by Labour as an attempt to remove Mr Bercow.
UK to introduce porn age-checks in July:::::Image copyright Getty Images An age-check scheme designed to stop under-18s viewing pornographic websites will come into force on 15 July.From that date, affected sites will have to verify the age of UK visitors.If they fail to comply they will face being blocked by internet service providers.But critics say teens may find it relatively easy to bypass the restriction or could simply turn to porn-hosting platforms not covered by the law.Twitter, Reddit and image-sharing community Imgur, for example, will not be required to administer the scheme because they fall under an exception where more than a third of a site or app's content must be pornographic to qualify.Likewise, any platform that hosts pornography but does not do so on a commercial basis - meaning it does not charge a fee or make money from adverts or other activity - will not be affected.Furthermore, it will remain legal to use virtual private networks (VPNs), which can make it seem like a UK-based computer is located elsewhere, to evade the age checks.The authorities have, however, acknowledged that age-verification is "not a silver bullet" solution, but rather a means to make it less likely that children stumble across unsuitable material online."The introduction of mandatory age-verification is a world-first, and we've taken the time to balance privacy concerns with the need to protect children from inappropriate content," said the Minister for Digital Margot James."We want the UK to be the safest place in the world to be online, and these new laws will help us achieve this."Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Past moves to police porn in the UK Call to action It had originally been proposed that pornographic services that refused to carry out age checks could be fined up to 250,000.However, this power will not be enforced because ministers believe the threat to block defiant sites will be sufficient and that trying to chase overseas-based entities for payment would have been difficult.However, the government has said that other measures could follow."We know that pornography is available on some social media platforms and we expect those platforms to do a lot more to create a safer environment for children," a spokesman for the Department of Digital Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) told the BBC."If we do not see action then we do not rule out legislating in the future to force companies to take responsibility for protecting vulnerable users from the potentially harmful content that they host."The age checks were originally proposed by the now defunct regulator Atvod in 2014 and were enacted into law as part of the the Digital Economy Act 2017.But their rollout had been repeatedly delayed.UK-hosted pornographic video services already have to verify visitors' ages, as do online gambling platforms.'Porn passes' The British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) - which gives movies their UK age certificates - will be responsible for regulating the effort.It will instruct internet providers which sites and apps to block for non-compliance.In addition, it can call on payment service providers to pull support, and ask search engines and advertisers to shun an offending business.The pornographic platforms themselves will have freedom to choose how to verify UK visitors' ages.But the BBFC has said that it will award solutions that adopt "robust" data-protection standards with a certificate, allowing them to display a green AV (age verification) symbol on their marketing materials to help consumers make an informed choice.One digital rights campaign group questioned the sense of this scheme being voluntary."Having some age verification that is good and other systems that are bad is unfair and a scammer's paradise - of the government's own making," said Jim Killock from the Open Rights Group."Data leaks could be disastrous.And they will be the government's own fault."Mindgeek, one of the adult industry's biggest players, has developed an online system of its own called AgeID, which it hopes will be widely adopted.It involves adults having to upload scans of their passports or driving licences, which are then verified by a third-party.It has said that all the information will be encrypted and that the AgeID system will not keep track of how each users' accounts are used.Image copyright Mindgeek Image caption Mindgeek intends to launch its AgeID system soon in the UK High street stores and newsagents will also sell separate age-verification cards to adults after carrying out face-to-face checks, according to the government.Dubbed "porn passes" by the media, the idea is that users would type in a code imprinted on the cards into pornographic websites to gain access to their content.The BBFC has said it will also create an online form for members of the public to flag non-compliant sites once the new regulations come into effect."We want to make sure that when these new rules are implemented they are as effective as possible," commented the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC)."To accomplish this, it is crucial the rules keep pace with the different ways that children are exposed to porn online."The age checks form part of a wider effort by the UK's authorities to make the internet safer to use for young people.Most recently, DCMS proposed the creation of a new regulator to tackle apps that contain content promoting self-harm and suicide, among other problems.In addition, the Information Commissioner's Office has proposed services stop using tools that encourage under-18s to share more personal data about themselves than they would do otherwise.Image copyright Getty Images Analysis: Chris Fox, Technology reporter The idea of the government keeping a database of verified porn viewers had sounded like a privacy and ethical nightmare.Luckily it has dodged that bullet.While ministers have ordered porn sites to age-verify users, they have not told them how they must do so.That means different sites will have different systems Those "porn passes" that your friendly local newsagent may soon dish out are a theoretical solution, but there is no obligation for any porn site to accept them.So, you may potentially have to verify yourself several times for several porn sites.Despite the introduction of a new kitemark-like badge to identify cyber-security conscious systems, there's still a concern that some will suffer data breaches causing people's adult interests to be exposed.
Politicians urged to cut ties with 'homophobic' pastor:::::Image caption Pastor Yang Tuck Yoong (left), Montgomeryshire AM Russell George (above right) and Clwyd West AM Darren Millar (below right) Two assembly members have been urged to sever their links with a controversial pastor who claimed homosexuality is a "sin".Yang Tuck Yoong called homosexuality an "abomination" during a sermon.Darren Millar and Russell George are trustees of the Evan Roberts Institute which has financial links with the pastor's Cornerstone Community Church.They say they do not share his views but human rights campaigners are calling for all ties to be cut.The pastor was reported to police in 2013 after saying: "Homosexuality is a sin and it is far more rampant, militant and organised than most of us actually believe it to be."He also called on the church to "rise up and take a stand".Image caption The Pisgah chapel in Loughor was brought back to life with money from the pastor's Cornerstone Community Church It has emerged the Pentecostal minister and his church in Singapore have strong ties with Welsh charity, The Evan Roberts Institute.Named after the Welsh revivalist, the institute was formed in 2013 to safeguard sites of religious and spiritual significance in Wales.In 2014 it bought Pisgah chapel in Loughor, Swansea, which had been earmarked for demolition.However the refurbishment work was paid for by Cornerstone Community Church.Mr Yang's church was also granted a 50-year lease by the institute.Image caption Peter Tatchell have said the pastors views were "out of touch" with public opinion in Wales Clwyd West AM Mr Millar, who helped finance the original 20,000 purchase with a loan, visited Asia in 2015 to meet with the leaders of Cornerstone Community Church, according to the institute's annual report.And he "thanked God" for Pastor Yang's support for another religious project in Wales, the purchase of the Bible College of Wales.However the pastor's comments have angered human rights groups.Campaigner Peter Tatchell said the views are "not compatible with humanitarian values".He added: "The Evans Roberts Institute should not be associated with him or his church in any way."These AMs should either stand down from the institute or make sure it has broken all ties with the pastor."The institute and both Conservative AMs said they do not support the views of Mr Yang on homosexuality.The Welsh Conservatives said they do not condone homophobia or discrimination "of any sort".Image caption Cai Wilshaw said the politicians should consider standing down if they do not cut all ties with the pastor However Cai Wilshaw of Pink News, which provides news for the LGBT community in the UK and worldwide, described the comments as "dangerous"."The pastor's views are not only homophobic but dangerously so when you think of the message it sends to, for example, a child in Wales who is being bullied for their sexual orientation or gender identity," he said."It's completely unacceptable for these politicians to have social, financial and legal links with someone who has such dangerous extremist views."Cutting those links don't go far enough.They must (act) in the same way they want to be represented in their constituencies."If they're not willing to educate themselves about LGBT rights then they should think about resigning."Welsh Labour AM Jeremy Miles added: "I'd support calls for Darren Millar and Russell George to sever their links with the pastor.I hope they will reflect on the message it sends to young people in their constituencies."Having faith and being gay are not incompatible.Drawing strength from faith should give us a rich understanding of humanity.And remind us that we are all different but equal."
EU struggles over law to tackle spread of terror online:::::Image copyright Getty Images EU officials are struggling to agree on a law aimed at preventing the spread of "terrorist content" online.The European Parliament approved a draft version of the law on Wednesday evening, which would impose a one-hour deadline to remove offending content.But a European Commission official told the BBC changes made to the text by parliament made the law ineffective.It now plans to agree a version closer to the original with a new parliament after the elections in May."Given the importance, we have to come back and work on this again with them," the official said.The law would affect social media platforms including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, which could face fines of up to 4% of their annual global turnover.What does the law say?The legislation, proposed by the Commission last year, gives internet companies one hour to remove offending content after receiving an order from a "competent authority" in an EU country."Terrorist content" includes material that incites or advocates for terrorist offences, promotes the activities of a terrorist group or teaches terrorist techniques, according to the draft text.In the original text, companies are also expected to take "proactive measures" to stop the spread of terrorist content.This includes using automated tools to prevent content that has previously been removed from being re-uploaded.Under the rules, companies operating in the EU could face hefty financial penalties if there is a "systematic failure" to comply.You may also be interested in What were the changes?In its amendments, the European Parliament said websites would not be forced to "monitor the information they transmit or store, nor have to actively seek facts indicating illegal activity".It said the "competent authority" should give the website information on the procedures and deadlines 12 hours before the agreed one-hour deadline the first time an order is issued.It also ruled that authorities dealing with "terrorist content" being posted in another EU member state should contact officials in that country, rather than dealing directly with the website."This is a strong position from the parliament which ensures that there will be a one-hour deadline to remove content.It also ensures safeguards for smaller platforms, ensures that there are no upload filters and preserves freedom of speech," MEP Daniel Dalton, the rapporteur for the proposal, told the BBC.'Christchurch test' The Commission official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the BBC that the latest version did not pass the "Christchurch test" of whether it would have been effective at stopping the spread of content during last month's New Zealand mosque attacks, which was live-streamed on Facebook."We don't think the amendments provide for effective measures," he said.Mr Dalton, however, told the BBC it was "the only possible compromise agreement which could have got through the parliament"."If the Commission thinks they can make significant changes to this proposal and get it through the parliament then they don't know this parliament very well," he said."The Commission proposal simply didn't have a majority in the parliament as it raised too many questions.It also didn't properly address the legality of cross border removal orders.The modifications we have made ensured that it could pass, whilst ensuring the key elements of the Commission proposal remain".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tributes in memory of the mosque attack victims in Christchurch, New Zealand What about free speech?Others said the amendments did not go far enough in protecting free speech.In February, German MEP Julia Reda of the European Pirate Party said the legislation risked the "surrender of our fundamental freedoms [and] undermines our liberal democracy."Ms Reda welcomed the changes brought by the European Parliament but said the one-hour deadline was "unworkable for platforms run by individual or small providers."She argued that pressure to keep such content offline would result in companies using automated filters that were "bound to lead to the deletion of legal uploads".Does terrorism spread online?David Ibsen, executive director of the Counter Extremism Project, said "the easy availability of terrorist content online continues to have a huge impact on radicalisation, recruitment, and incitement to violence."Police investigations have repeatedly found a critical link between radicalising content online and terror attacks.Nice, France, the Bataclan concert hall attack in Paris, and the Manchester arena bombing are but a few examples of how individuals can be radicalised online."European Commissioner for the Security Union Sir Julian King described the spread of terrorist content online as "a clear and present danger that needs to be stamped out"."It has had a role to play in every single attack on European soil in the last few years, whether through incitement to commit an attack, instruction on how to carry it out or glorification of the deadly results," he told the BBC."The potential damage caused by terrorist content online rises dramatically with every hour it remains online, spreading from platform to platform.And it's not only Da'esh [IS]: other jihadist groups such as al-Qaeda are still a threat, as are violent right-wing extremists."He said the Commission "look forward to continuing our work with MEPs and with the Council in the coming months to find an effective way forward on this critical security file".
Brexit limbo: Hotels, packing boxes and plans on hold for the MEPs:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Lib Dem Catherine Bearder and Conservative Daniel Dalton are among the MEPs living in uncertain times Their offices are full of boxes, they're living in hotels and don't ask them when they're having their leaving drinks.How have the UK's MEPs been coping with the ever-changing Brexit situation?It's the last day of the European Parliament in Strasbourg before the elections in May, but there's not much last-minute packing for the UK group of MEPs - they've been ready to go for nearly a month.When the UK voted to leave the EU, the country's representatives in the European Parliament expected to be out of a job on 29 March.Instead they have watched two deadlines pass by as MPs in Westminster failed to agree on the withdrawal deal.Now a new Brexit date of 31 October means the UK is likely to take part in European elections on 23 May and some MEPs are eyeing an unexpected return to Europe.But job prospects there could be short-lived.Whenever the UK breaks the Brexit deadlock, they could be sent home.And if the prime minister succeeds in winning support for a deal before polling day, elections could be called off altogether.MEPs are used to a nomadic life, dividing their time between parliament sessions in Brussels and Strasbourg, as well as their home constituencies in the UK.But many of them feel recent months have taken an already unstable situation to extremes.Catherine Bearder, Liberal Democrat MEP, says: "Life is never certain as a politician, but this is beyond anything I've ever seen before."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption MEPs do not yet know when they will be saying goodbye to Brussels The 70-year-old had been planning a quiet retirement - "painting, gardening, doing yoga" - but said she is back on an election footing now, determined to fight to keep the UK's place at the European table.For Nathan Gill, a former UKIP and independent MEP who has now joined the newly launched Brexit Party, the delays have been a blow to the cause he spent the last 15 years of his life on.Speaking from an office filled with packing boxes, he says: "It's unbelievable, it's disgraceful."He says he was forced to leave his Brussels apartment and move into a hotel after his lease ended.Later he got turfed out of there too.As UK Prime Minister Theresa May sought the latest extension to Brexit and an emergency EU summit rolled into town, prices rose so much that Mr Gill had to temporarily decamp to Antwerp, some 25 miles (41km) away.Who are the UK's MEPs?Every country in the EU elects representatives to the parliament, which meets in Strasbourg and Brussels.The UK has 73 MEPs, representing each of its 12 regions for five-year terms.Their job is to debate and to help decide on EU laws, as well as scrutinising the work of EU institutions.The last election saw 19 Conservatives elected, 20 from Labour and 24 from UKIP - although 19 UKIP MEPs have since left the party and one was expelled.The Greens have three MEPs, the SNP has two and there is one each from the Liberal Democrats, Democratic Unionist Party, Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionist Party and Plaid Cymru.Labour's David Martin is the UK's longest-serving MEP, first elected in 1984.The Brexit Party is not the only new party planning to contest these European elections.Change UK - formed by former Labour and Tory MPs, initially under the name The Independent Group - says it had 3,700 people applying to be candidates.MEPs themselves will receive a transitional allowance when their term ends, equivalent to a month's salary for every year they have served.But across the political spectrum, they are united in feeling that staff have been treated badly.Each MEP has a budget to hire assistants, with up to three in Brussels as well as staff in their home region.Information about the future for these staff members is scarce and always changing, MEPs say.Contracts could not be extended until Brexit extensions were officially confirmed by the European Council, usually at the last minute as negotiations went to the wire.For some staff, the last-minute deadline extensions meant losing redundancy pay as they had already accepted jobs elsewhere.Others who remain are sleeping on sofas as their apartment leases run out.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption "We've got a plan A and a plan B, which is more than the government has," says Jean Lambert MEP "It's very brutal from a staff point of view," says Conservative MEP Daniel Dalton."You're in one day and out the other and your staff are out with you."Green MEP Jean Lambert says staff had to be made redundant and offices closed as the original Brexit deadline loomed in March.But the party kept in place a contingency plan in case the UK took part in European elections."We've got a plan A and a plan B, which is more than the government has," she says - although she plans to retire as an elected representative.If the UK does elect MEPs, what will they do in a potentially short-lived return to Brussels and Strasbourg?Some Brexiteer politicians such as Nathan Gill warn that they plan to make the EU nations "regret" the UK MEPs' return.Mr Gill says the Brexit Party hopes to work with other anti-EU and anti-euro parties across the continent, such as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Italy's anti-immigration League party, to cause disruption."We want them to realise they should have just let us go," he says."They don't need this thorn in their side."But Conservative MEP Mr Dalton, who backs the government's Brexit withdrawal agreement, says it would be "completely counter-productive".He says British politicians have often failed to understand that the EU Parliament is based on compromise, so the adversarial politics of Westminster fall flat."All it does is annoy people," he says."They're much more likely to get more stubborn."Image copyright David Martin Image caption David Martin intends to use Brexit as a "case study in how not to negotiate" UKIP MEP Stuart Agnew is another who has postponed retirement to take part in the elections, if they happen.He says he was surprised that Westminster MPs had let the Brexit deadlock get to this point."I would have lost a bet.I thought they would have banged heads together, that the Conservatives wouldn't want European elections and neither would Labour.I was wrong," he says.Other MEPs have made firm decisions not to stand again but have still been left bewildered by recent weeks.David Martin, Labour MEP, says he intends to do academic lecturing on the EU and trade policy, but had been struggling to agree a start date."The Brexit negotiations will be a really good case study in how not to negotiate with the European Union," he says.He has also been puzzling over a unique issue of etiquette: when should Brexiting MEPs say their goodbyes?As Mr Martin puts it: "You don't want to have a farewell dinner and say goodbye to everyone, and still be there the next day."
Has Brexit fractured Irish-unionist relations?:::::Image copyright European Photopress Image caption Unionists have been critical of Leo Varardkar's approach to Brexit Last week marked 21 years since the Good Friday peace agreement was signed - the deal that effectively helped bring decades of violence in Northern Ireland to an end.It was co-forged by the British and Irish governments and led to the establishment of joint Irish-British bodies to help continue building progress.But the Irish government has previously said Brexit threatens to undo much of that.Another unintended consequence of Brexit seems to have been the impact on relations between unionists and the Irish government.Last week, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Emma Little-Pengelly said it was sad that the behaviour of the Irish government in relation to the Brexit negotiations "has so fundamentally fractured the carefully built relationships with unionists".The Irish government is at odds with unionist opinion in Northern Ireland on the backstop contained within the Brexit deal, because of unionist concern that the trade differences it would cause between Northern Ireland and Great Britain could threaten the break-up of the union.All unionist parties in Northern Ireland are opposed to the backstop, but the Irish government insists it must endure in the agreement until another workable solution can be found.Mrs Little-Pengelly accused the Irish government of "completely and aggressively" dismissing unionist concerns in relation to the withdrawal agreement and suggested it had damaged relations in a way that would be difficult to rebuild.However, that is a claim the Irish government has always rejected.Image caption In a sign that there is still some warmth, Bertie Ahern and Ian Paisley hugged each other at a memorial event for Mr Paisley's father Just as recently as last week, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said he believed his government had a "good relationship" with the DUP and that they communicated at all levels.But has Brexit irreparably damaged relations built up over the past two decades?Former DUP adviser Tim Cairns said he did not think they were broken beyond repair, but he puts the blame for much of the friction at the feet of the Irish government.He said he believed that if Leo Varadkar and his current Tnaiste (Deputy PM) Simon Coveney, had been in charge in 1998, then there would not have been a peace agreement at all."They don't possess relational qualities - there seems to be no capacity for relationship building," he added.'Need to reach across' He accused them of not understanding "the relational nature of politics" in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and said Mr Varadkar could learn lessons from one of his predecessors, Bertie Ahern.Mr Ahern was taoiseach during the talks that led to the Good Friday Agreement and worked on subsequent Stormont deals including the 2006 St Andrews Agreement before leaving office in 2008.A matter of weeks ago, Mr Ahern attended an event in memory of the late DUP leader, Ian Paisley Senior.Mr Cairns said Mr Ahern had understood that in order to cut a deal, there is a "need to reach across" - but that because the UK government had agreed to the backstop, he believed that the Irish government did not feel a need to reach out.Image copyright AFP Image caption Brexit has caused division among politicians in Westminster, Belfast and Dublin Brexit has certainly created a more frosty political atmosphere and with it, harsher exchanges of language.It is not just the DUP that has accused the Irish government of ramping up tensions.The Ulster Unionist Party's leader Robin Swann attended the Fine Gael conference in October, and said some comments the Irish government had made about Brexit "were like a poke in the eye to unionists".He said when his party raised legitimate concerns over the backstop, that seemed to be met with a "suck-it-up attitude".That being said, a former taoiseach told BBC News NI that while he believes personal relations with unionists remain positive, Brexit has had "inevitable consequences" on political relationships.John Bruton, who was Irish prime minister from 1994 until 1997, said Brexit had fractured relationships - but it was not through anything the Irish government had done."I regret to say the DUP by supporting Brexit has contributed directly, and foreseeably, to the situation we have today," he said.He also rejected the suggestion that the Irish government acted aggressively in the negotiations.'Substance not adjectives' "We didn't want Brexit.What the Irish government has done consistently is to explain the consequences of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The DUP has insisted it wants the UK to leave the EU with a deal, but has criticised the Irish government's handling of negotiations "It's not about adjectives, it's about substance," he added, explaining that name-calling and describing relations as "toxic" was not helpful to anyone.It is perhaps worth noting that it was not always like this.Back in 2012, Simon Coveney became the first Irish government minister to attend a DUP conference.At the time, Mr Coveney said his appearance at the conference in the La Mon hotel was further proof of the "increasing trust" among politicians in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.Last month, the DUP's chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson was on a panel at the Fine Gael conference - but on Wednesday, Mr Coveney told the Dil (Irish Parliament) he had not had any "detailed discussions" with DUP politicians since then.It seems the seismic events at Westminster that have impacted political relationships, mean there is now much more work for both sides to do, if they want to restore and keep building trust.
House of Commons recess: How much time off do MPs get?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption MPs cheer Easter break for the House of Commons There was a collective sigh of relief around Westminster when MPs were told last week that their Easter recess would be going ahead.But others have criticised politicians for taking a break while Brexit remains up in the air - especially after a direct warning from the EU not to waste time during the latest extension.So, how much time do politicians spend at work?And do they get too much or too little time off?Here are the facts so you can make up your own mind.When do MPs sit in the Commons?Parliamentary sessions begin in either May or June.They are marked by the State Opening of Parliament - when the Queen comes to Westminster and gives a speech, outlining the government's plans for the year.A session normally lasts for 12 months, but sometimes the government decides to extend it.This happened with the 2017 session, which was extended to two years because of the looming Brexit battles.There are a number of "recesses" during a session too, similar to the timetable of school and bank holidays.But they are not set in stone, and it is up to the Leader of the House - currently Andrea Leadsom - to lay down the dates in the Commons.Image copyright PA Image caption The Queen and Prince Charles at the last State Opening of Parliament On an average week, MPs tend to sit for four days: Monday: From 14:30 up until 22:30 Tuesday: From 11:30 up until 19:30 Wednesday: From 11:30 up until 19:30 Thursday: From 09:30 up until 17:30 MPs don't have to be there for these hours.When less important business is going on in the Commons, MPs are able to do other things, such as travel abroad on fact-finding trips or even carry out other jobs - like Labour MP Karen Lee who works as a nurse, or Conservative MP Dan Poulter who does shifts as a doctor - or they can do nothing.But if important votes are expected, MPs will be put on a "three-line whip" by their party leadership, meaning they have to be in the vicinity.This has been the norm during the recent Brexit storm, with MPs reporting blanket three-line whips when there would usually be more flexibility.The late start time on Monday allows MPs who represent constituencies further away from Westminster to travel.The member with the longest commute is Lib Dem MP for Orkney and Shetland Alistair Carmichael, who has a 713 mile journey to work.MPs also sit on 13 Fridays in each session between 09:30 and 15:00 to discuss Private Members' Bills - bills proposed by backbench MPs, rather than ministers.The government can propose additional Friday sittings if extra time is needed.This happened on 29 March - the day the UK was meant to leave the EU - so the prime minister could put her Brexit withdrawal deal to MPs.But when they are not in Westminster, Fridays are often used for surgeries - where MPs can meet their constituents - and other local work, which can fall into the weekend.How many days do MPs sit in the Commons?As this session has been going on for more than a year, it is hard to compare sessions directly - but let us instead compare the years.If you take the first 10 months of the 2016-17 session, MPs sat for 125 days in the Commons.For the first 10 months of the 2017 session, MPs sat for 122 days.But in the last 10 months - from when the Queen's speech would have started the 2018 session until now - they have sat for 138 days.These additional 16 days of work include two weeks of recess being cancelled - a week in February and the first week of the usual two-week Easter recess - as well as the additional Brexit Day sitting.What about holiday, paternity leave and sick pay?The simple answer to this is that MPs are not entitled to any of it.When someone gets elected to Parliament, in legal terms they become an "office holder" - which is different to being an employee or self-employed.It means that once they have pledged their oath of allegiance to the Queen, they get their salary, regardless of whether or not they show up in Westminster.The seven Sinn Fein MPs do not get a salary, as they will not pledge their allegiance to the Crown.But being an office holder is a double-edged sword for those who do.While MPs get the money even if they don't attend Parliament, they are not entitled to maternity leave, sick pay or holidays like an average employee.For example, MPs who have had a baby often choose to take a few weeks off, but might still continue with their constituency work, even if they don't come to the Commons.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption One pregnant MP delayed her C-section to vote in the Commons Recently, proxy voting was introduced for those MPs on maternity or paternity leave, so another MP can vote on their behalf.However, this cannot be used for MPs who are sick or choose to go on holiday.Also, if an MP dies - as in the case of the murdered Jo Cox - another member from a neighbouring constituency might take on their urgent cases so people still have a voice, but they do not receive extra pay.
Conservative leadership: Javid and other contenders take to the stage:::::Image copyright PA Sajid Javid's speech on violent crime, with its deeply personal tone, is being seen as his opening salvo in the forthcoming race to succeed Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party.It's been going on in the wings for some time, although not easily visible to the audience.But we are now seeing the first tentative steps onto the stage; the start of a beauty pageant whose winner will probably be our next prime minister.Last week, it was Health Secretary Matt Hancock, the International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and the ambitious backbencher Tom Tugendhat setting out their thoughts on how the party could appeal to younger voters.Today, it was the home secretary, with a speech that had at its core two of the biggest-tell tale signs of a leadership campaign limbering up.A minister roaming beyond their brief."The mindset of government needs to shift," he said, and doing so in a speech peppered with personal experience.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Sajid Javid: I could have been drawn into life of crime Should he decide to stand, Mr Javid's greatest political asset is his own story.His is a biography that personifies the Conservative ideal; the son of an immigrant family who worked hard, became a millionaire and rose to the cabinet; a life shaped by aspiration rather than privilege.His critics, though, see a faltering public speaker.They also point to what they saw as his tortured, calculating equivocation before the EU referendum, voting to Remain "with a heavy heart and no enthusiasm" as he put it.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Amber Rudd says Conservative Party leadership bid is entirely possible Earlier on Monday, another contender tried to downplay the prospect of an imminent contest.During a visit to Japan, Jeremy Hunt insisted he was getting on with Foreign Office business and seeing Brexit through.But the foreign secretary also found time to mildly rebuke his predecessor and likely rival Boris Johnson, who had earlier weighed in on the debate on the country's future in his weekly Daily Telegraph column.And on Wednesday, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she was not ruling out a tilt at the top job, telling the BBC she had left the door "slightly ajar" to a leadership bid.Welcome to the contest for the ultimate political prize.It's only just beginning.
Is Notre-Dame fire a warning for UK Houses of Parliament?:::::After the devastating fire that engulfed Notre Dame, MPs in the UK have started to fear for another iconic building closer to home.The Houses of Parliament in London mostly date from the 19th Century, but some parts go back as far as 1099.The estate is in desperate need of repair, with an outdated electrical system being just one of the "critical risks" to the Grade I listed building.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the fire in Paris should serve as a "warning" to get the work done.And Leader of the House of Commons Andrea Leadsom said it was a "crucial reminder of the importance of preserving our historic buildings".There is a plan for a full "Restoration and Renewal programme" for the site, but what will it involve and when will it take place?What are the issues with the building?Much of the building's mechanical and electrical systems, such as heating, lighting and power, were installed into the building after World War Two and should have been replaced in the 1980s.But Tom Healey, the restoration programme director, said Parliament had taken a "patch and mend approach" instead, to keep systems plodding along despite being way beyond their shelf life.Other issues include: Steam, gas and water services being built on top of each other and next to high voltage electricity wires - posing a major risk to both A lack of disabled access into both the Commons and Lords Almost 200 miles of telephone, broadcasting and sound cabling needing to be upgraded Over 1,000 spaces containing asbestos What is the plan for future works?The Palace of Westminster Restoration and Renewal Programme aims to make the building fit for the 21st century in one single phase.It will bring the site up-to-date, including ripping out and replacing 240 miles-worth of cabling, installing a new sewage system and improving access.But to do this, MPs and peers need to move out to allow the work to be done.Image copyright UK Parliament Image caption Around 85% of plant rooms in the estate need upgrades In early 2018, both Houses agreed this was the best and most cost-effective way to carry out the upgrades, and now a bill is working its way through Parliament to set up a body to create the plan and oversee it.But again, this work is going to take time.Before the programme can get going, a number of things need to happen, including developing a detailed design brief and budget to be signed off by Parliament, and designing and testing out temporary accommodation.Richmond House, on Whitehall - near the existing Palace of Westminster - is the preferred location for the temporary Commons, while the Queen Elizabeth II Centre - a stone's throw from Parliament Square - is preferred for the Lords.Image copyright AFP Image caption Gutters have corroded around the building To allow time to get all this preparation done, the programme isn't expected to begin until the mid-2020s.It is also too early to say how much the works will cost, as a more exact figure will not be known until the body in charge makes its business case.However, in 2015, the Independent Options Appraisal did identify indicative, relative costs for a range of the options, and estimated the one phase programme would cost between 3.52bn and 3.87bn, at 2014 prices.What work has taken place so far?Some issues were deemed too urgent to wait for the full programme to start, hence why some of the buildings are already covered in scaffolding.This includes work to Elizabeth Tower - home to Big Ben - where the roof will be stripped off and restored, the bell frame repaired, leaks into the clock room stemmed and a lift installed.A brick enclosure in the tower will also be replaced with glass to allow Big Ben to be viewed by people walking up the staircase.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The clock won't chime again until 2021, except on special occasions A major project to improve fire safety across the estate was also completed last year, including upgrades to fire doors, new signs and a high pressure water mist system.Teams of fire safety officers also patrol the buildings 24 hours a day to spot any fire safety issues.Has Notre-Dame quickened the timetable?It has definitely increased attention to the issue from MPs, including from Labour's Chris Bryant.Skip Twitter post by @RhonddaBryant We have taken far too long already putting our fire safety measures in place.Parts of the Palace are as old as Notre Dame and we must make sure that every fire precaution is taken as the major work goes ahead.God knows we've had enough warnings.Chris Bryant (@RhonddaBryant) April 15, 2019 Report But there is still so much work to do, it is hard to see the process being sped up.A Parliamentary spokesman said: "Fire safety is a key priority for Parliament and protections are constantly reviewed and updated, including at our active construction sites, and in planning for the future restoration and renewal of the Palace of Westminster."We stand ready to learn any lessons that emerge from the fire at Notre Dame to ensure we do everything possible to protect our people and buildings on the Parliamentary Estate."
From Farage to Batten: What happened to UKIP's class of 2014?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption UKIP topped the polls in 2014 - but things have not gone to plan since then In the 2014 European elections, UKIP defied expectations to become the largest British party in the European Parliament.Twenty four UKIP MEPs were elected and the party won 27.5% of the vote - an achievement its then leader Nigel Farage described as "historic".UKIP's success in these elections was one of the factors behind David Cameron promising a referendum on Brexit - as he feared losing more Conservative voters to UKIP.However five years on from that election, only four of those 24 MEPs still represent the party.So, where and why did they all go?Post-referendum infighting: Expulsion, defections and a retirement Image copyright PA Image caption Amjad Bashir was the first MEP to leave the party Less than a year after being elected as a UKIP MEP in the 2014 elections, Amjad Bashir defected to the Conservative Party calling UKIP "pretty amateur".However, UKIP said he had been suspended over financial and employment concerns.In March 2015 Janice Atkinson was expelled from UKIP for "bringing the party into disrepute" following a newspaper investigation into an apparent expenses claim.Image copyright AFP Image caption Diane James lasted 18 days as leader Diane James's resignation followed a string of strange events in which she was elected leader of the party in September 2016 but stepped down just 18 days later - a move her long-serving predecessor Nigel Farage described as "yet another act of irrational selfishness".Ms James, who now sits as an independent MEP, said it was "time to move on".Image copyright UKIP Image caption Steven Woolfe was taken to hospital following an incident with a colleague in the European Parliament Another bizarre twist followed when would-be successor Steven Woolfe went to hospital following an altercation with another MEP in the European Parliament.He quit UKIP soon afterwards claiming the party was "in a death spiral".In July 2017 Roger Helmer said he was stepping down, telling the BBC "I think at the age of 73 I'm perfectly entitled to retire".The Bolton era: 'Countless leaks, briefings and character assassinations' Image copyright PA Image caption Henry Bolton was never an MEP and quickly lost the confidence of the party as leader In September 2017, Henry Bolton became UKIP's fourth leader in 18 months - following Paul Nuttall's decision to quit after the party lost ground in the snap general election.However he quickly became mired in a row over his personal life when his partner, Jo Marney, was reported to have sent racist texts about Meghan Markle.The row prompted several senior UKIP MEPs to quit their posts in the party - and one MEP - Jonathan Arnott - to quit the party altogether.Mr Arnett, the party's North East of England representative, described Mr Bolton as "not the right person for the job".He also lamented the "unpleasant nature" of the party including "countless leaks, briefings and character assassinations".Batten takes over: 'Increasingly out of kilter' Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gerard Batten's controversial reign has seen a drove of resignations In February 2018, Mr Bolton was sacked as leader and replaced by Gerard Batten.Mr Batten said he would "concentrate on doing all I can to restore the party's fortunes" but, under his leadership, eleven UKIP MEPs have quit the party.In May 2018, West Midlands MEP James Carver announced his resignation writing: "I now find myself increasingly out of kilter with the party."A year earlier Mr Carver resigned from his post as UKIP's foreign affairs spokesman in protest at the party's plans to ban the burka arguing "no-one has the right to dictate what people should wear".In October 2018 Bill Etheridge left the party describing it as a "vehicle of hate towards Muslims and the gay community".Gerard Batten said Mr Etheridge should "do the decent and honourable thing and resign his seat, thereby handing it back to UKIP to which it morally belongs".Tommy Robinson hired: 'A catastrophic error' Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Robinson was hired to advise UKIP on grooming gangs and prison reform In November, Mr Batten caused outrage when he decided to hire Tommy Robinson as an adviser arguing that the ex-leader of the English Defence League was "a good person to have onside".This prompted a wave of resignations.In December, Nigel Farage told LBC he was quitting the party and accused Mr Batten of being "pretty obsessed with the issue of Islam".Mr Nuttall followed him out of the door, saying "putting Tommy Robinson front and centre, whilst Brexit is in the process of being betrayed is, in my view, a catastrophic error".He also said the party had "lost its way in recent times" and attacked its "clumsy, blundering approach" to tackling female genital mutilation and its "hardline anti-Islam messages".Nathan Gill, one time leader of UKIP in Wales, said: "I can no longer belong to a party that has switched its primary focus from Brexit, to a foolish pursuit against Islam and the promotion of Tommy Robinson."On 15 April 2019, three female MEPs - Jill Seymour, Jane Collins and Margot Parker - all quit.Image copyright PA Image caption Jane Collins said the party's attitude to women was "disgusting" Ms Seymour, who represents the West Midlands, said she was "not walking away from the party's original core principles, but the present party's direction means it has walked away from me, and its original membership".Responding to her resignation, Mr Batten tweeted that her decision was driven by "sour grapes and hypocrisy".Ms Collins, MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber Region, blamed UKIP's "disgusting" attitude towards women for her decision, saying Mr Batten's defence of an election candidate's rape comments as "satire" in a BBC interview had "made her sick to the stomach".And Margot Parker, who represents the East Midlands, said she could not be part of Mr Batten's "distasteful regime any longer", saying he had "taken his eye off the ball" and was crusading on divisive issues.The other MEPs to quit under Mr Batten's leadership are Lord William Dartmouth, Julia Reid, Patrick O'Flynn, David Coburn, Louise Bours and Tim Aker - many of whom were allies of Mr Farage.According to the European Parliament website, Louise Bours left UKIP in November 2018 to become an independent MEP - however, she has made no public statement about her decision.Where have they gone?Ten sit as MEPs for the Brexit Party - a new group launched by Nigel Farage Seven sit as independent MEPs Amjad Bashir has joined the Conservatives Patrick O'Flynn has joined the Social Democratic Party and is planning to stand as a candidate if there is a by-election in Peterborough Roger Helmer has retired Who is left?Image caption Mike Hookem is one of only three MEPs elected in 2014 currently confirmed as standing again Of the 24 MEPs who were elected to the European Parliament in 2014, just four remain.They are Stuart Agnew, Raymond Finch, Mike Hookem and their leader Gerard Batten.UKIP has confirmed that three of them - Mr Agnew, Mr Hookem and Mr Batten - have been selected to stand in the party's top tier of candidates this May.When asked about the decline in his party's representation, Mr Batten said that many MEPs had left before he became leader .In a statement the party said: "UKIP is entering the Euro elections with the three loyal MEPs who have honoured their commitments, alongside a fresh slate of candidates."We expect to win big."
Can the Tories and Labour agree on Brexit?:::::Image copyright Reuters Image caption Andrew Fisher (centre) accompanied Mr McDonnell to the talks Cross-party talks are continuing in Whitehall, amid parliamentary deadlock over Theresa May's Brexit deal.So what are the sticking points and can Labour and the Conservatives reach an agreement?Public statements on the talks have tended to be bland, ranging from "constructive" and "serious" to the slightly more negative: "We have some way to travel."Behind the scenes, the prospect of a deal, while difficult, is not impossible.There is a big incentive for both sides to reach agreement: the avoidance of next month's European elections.Prime Minister Theresa May doesn't want to give a platform to parties such as Nigel Farage's new project which could appeal to Brexit-voting Conservatives.And, frankly, some of her own activists would be conflicted over how, or whether, to vote.For Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, awkward questions about a second referendum could be ducked if there is no election campaign.So the talks are serious and not just political window dressing, and the fact that Mr Corbyn and Mrs May met on Thursday is significant.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Michael Gove is one of the Conservatives taking part in negotiations The Labour leader's policy guru Andrew Fisher joined shadow chancellor John McDonnell for the cross-party talks on Friday.But, as I understand it, significant hurdles remain.Some of the detail of possible changes to the Political Declaration - the blueprint for the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU - is being discussed.But sequencing is a problem.Labour wants to discuss legally binding changes to the document, future-proofing it, where possible, against a change of Conservative leader.Broadly speaking, the government would rather do "the easy bit" first - discussing legislation to protect workers' rights.Resolving this tension is key to a deal.Labour is also keen to secure agreement on a customs union.It is flexible on what it would be called - an "arrangement", for example - and Mrs May hinted on Thursday that the two sides were close on this.But they are not yet close enough.The definition of what a customs union/arrangement does is vital to the Labour side.But the main constraints to a deal may come from Mrs May and Mr Corbyn's parties, rather than their negotiators.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many Labour members want another referendum if agreement is reached If there is too much compromise on a customs union, Mrs May risks losing more cabinet ministers.For Mr Corbyn, the pressure from many Labour members is for him to exact a referendum, in return for passing the deal.So far, the prime minister isn't budging on this.One way round this obstacle would be to hold a separate vote in Parliament on a referendum, possibly as an amendment to the forthcoming Withdrawal Agreement Bill.Both Mrs May and Mr Corbyn - who is not an enthusiast for a public vote - believe this would fall.But some of the Labour leader's shadow ministers - including some who are firmly on the Left - are pushing for a referendum, or confirmatory ballot, to be tied explicitly to any Brexit deal.So, getting a deal passed would be totally dependent on approving a public vote at the same time.I am told shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer is pressing for a ballot to be part of any final package.If, in the end, these difficulties can't be overcome then the hope is that both sides will at least agree a parliamentary process for discussing and voting on options which might finally break the deadlock.

European elections: How the UK is gearing up for likelihood of polls:::::Image copyright PA Image caption UKIP topped the polls in 2014 but a lot has changed since then The UK's political parties are gearing up to fight elections to the European Parliament in six weeks' time.The planning needed to stage the polls on 23 May is under way, even though Theresa May still hopes the UK will have left the EU by then and they won't need to happen.As recently as the end of March, the prime minister said the public would find it "unacceptable" to have to elect a new group of 72 MEPs almost three years after they voted to leave the EU.But things have changed since then.Under terms agreed with EU leaders in Brussels, the UK has been given a Brexit extension until 31 October.The UK "must hold the elections to the European Parliament" and if it fails to do this, the UK will leave on 1 June without a deal.Given the political backdrop, they could turn out to be the most controversial and unpredictable European elections in UK history.How are the parties preparing?In short, in something of a hurry.The parties have to submit the names of the candidates representing them to the elections watchdog by 25 April or, in the case of the South West region, 24 hours earlier.MEPs are elected on a regional list basis, representing Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and nine English regions, using a system of proportional representation.If you want to know more about the European Parliament, the UK electoral process and the cost of staging the elections, read our Reality Check guide.While many Brexiteers are angry about the UK having to participate at all, believing it is a waste of time and money, the likelihood of any kind of boycott seems remote.Many now regard the poll as a proxy referendum on Brexit and the UK's future in the EU.UKIP, whose party topped the 2014 poll, has launched a crowdfunding campaign and announced its slate of two leading candidates in each of the regions.How are candidates being selected?Image caption The leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament has said he will stand again Given the lack of time, the selection process is likely to be more truncated than usual.Labour is giving its existing MEPs preferential treatment by guaranteeing them spots at the top of each regional candidate list.As it stands, 16 of the 20 Labour MEPs elected in 2014 have applied to stand.Would-be Conservative candidates had until Tuesday 9 April to put themselves forward.The Conservative Home website said it was very unlikely all 18 incumbents would try again as many have been planning for life after Brexit.It queried whether the party would be able to fill all 70 spots on its respective lists with "candidates' WhatsApp groups full of jokes about the futility of taking part".The current leader of the Conservative group in the European Parliament, Ashley Fox, has confirmed he will be taking part and joked about the likely reception he could get on the doorsteps.The Liberal Democrats and the Green Party see the polls as an opportunity to make the case for continued EU membership, with the Greens vowing to "mobilise one of the strongest pro-EU movements ever".However, talk of different anti-Brexit, pro-referendum parties co-operating, either by putting forward a single list of candidates or not standing in certain regions, has come to nothing.Skip Twitter post by @TheGreenParty The Green Party has no plans to field joint remain lists.It is not legally viable in short time frame available.However, assertions that we were approached by other remain parties & turned down offers to collaborate are simply untrue.The Green Party (@TheGreenParty) April 17, 2019 Report How much will the elections cost?The estimated cost of taking part in European Parliamentary elections has been given as up to 109m.This is based on the cost in 2014 which was 108.7m.What happened last time?The political landscape was very different the last time the European elections were held in 2014.The Conservatives and Lib Dems were governing in coalition and even though David Cameron had signalled his desire to hold an EU referendum if he won an overall majority, the prospect still seemed far off.But, with hindsight, the result could be seen to have been harbinger of things to come as UKIP topped the polls for the first ever time, winning nearly 27% of the vote and 24 seats.The party made its first proper electoral breakthrough a decade earlier when it won 15% of the vote and 12 seats in 2004's polls.European elections have historically been more fertile territory for anti-establishment parties, which have struggled to translate votes into seats in general elections because of the first-past-the-post system.The Conservatives and Labour are understandably nervous that this trend will continue if the polls go ahead.Will there be any new faces this time?Image copyright Reuters Image caption Same message, different party: Nigel Farage is heading the new Brexit Party after leaving UKIP For the past 20 years, UKIP has been the insurgent party in British politics but now it is facing a challenge from its former leader Nigel Farage, who has launched a rival outfit called the Brexit Party.Mr Farage, who will be standing as a candidate in the South East region, has vowed to "teach the establishment a lesson".The party, which has launched its campaign, is positioning itself as the real alternative to the Conservatives and Labour which it says have betrayed the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen is leading The Independent Group into the elections There is little love lost between Mr Farage and Mr Batten after the latter appointed anti-Islam campaigner Tommy Robinson as an adviser.There are reports the ex-English Defence League leader could play some kind of role in UKIP's campaign.Eurosceptic voters are likely to have a plethora of choice in May's polls, with other parties set to stand including Our Nation, an entity formed last year by the short-lived UKIP leader Henry Bolton.The prospect of a possible realignment is not confined to the right of British politics.The breakaway Independent Group of former Labour and Tory MPs say they will be fielding a substantial number of candidates after their application to become a political party was accepted by the Electoral Commission.They will fight the election as Change UK - The Independent Group, on a platform of seeking another referendum on the terms of Brexit, with the option to remain.Interim leader, ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen, has said the poll is a "real opportunity" to build a new political movement, suggesting the public is crying out "for someone to lead and say we can just stay".What will happen after the elections?How long any UK MEPs get to stay in Brussels and Strasbourg is anyone's guess at this stage.The new European Parliament is set to reassemble in early July, and the Brexit extension is due to run up to 31 October.It is no longer beyond the realms of possibility that UK politicians and their staff, who only recently were contemplating a future outside the European Parliament, will find themselves there.
Brexit: What happens now?:::::The EU and UK have agreed a further delay to Brexit until 31 October.So how will the deadlock be broken?The UK could leave earlier if a withdrawal agreement has been ratified by MPs.The country must now take part in European elections on 23 May - if it did not the UK would have to leave the EU on 1 June without a deal.The UK was originally due to leave on 29 March.The first extension shifted that date to 12 April.But now the UK now has just over six months to decide what it wants to do.Government ministers are continuing talks with Labour leaders to try to find a compromise deal.If they can agree, MPs will be given a chance to vote on the deal.If not, a range of alternative options will be put to them instead.In either case, the prime minister says the negotiated withdrawal agreement would remain unchanged.That's the legally binding part of the Brexit deal that covers exit terms - including money, the transition period, citizen's rights and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic.There could be changes to the non-legally binding political declaration which sets out parameters for the long-term future relationship.Or new commitments on Britain's future negotiating objectives could be written into legislation.The government is still committed to trying to leave the EU with a deal as soon as possible.But if the compromise plan does not yield results, many things could happen.1.No deal No-deal Brexit is still the default outcome if MPs can't agree anything else and there are no further extensions.If Parliament can't agree a deal soon and the UK does not take part in the European elections on 23 May then a no-deal Brexit would happen on 1 June.If the elections do take place then the next deadline is now 31 October.It would also be possible for MPs to back a no-deal Brexit - although there has been a majority against that option when they have voted on it before.2.Leave the EU on the PM's deal Despite the repeated rejection of Theresa May's deal, it has not been permanently ruled out.Even now, if a compromise cannot be agreed with the Labour leader, and if there is no majority among MPs for an alternative, it remains a possibility.And with the longer Brexit delay now in place, the negotiated deal could come back at a later date as a way of allowing an early exit.Also, if negotiations with the EU on any alternative plan run into difficulties, the two sides could decide to return to the one deal that has been fully worked out.3.Major renegotiation The government could choose to negotiate a completely new Brexit deal - perhaps in accordance with votes of MPs.This wouldn't be a question of making small additions to the political declaration.Instead, there could be a complete renegotiation that would take some time - perhaps involving a rewrite of the withdrawal agreement which would take much longer.If the EU refused to re-enter negotiations, the government would have to plump for one of the other options instead.4.Another referendum A further possibility is to hold another referendum.It could have the same status as the 2016 referendum, which was legally non-binding and advisory.But some MPs want to hold a binding referendum where the result would automatically take effect - like with the 2011 referendum on changing the voting system for UK general elections.One widely discussed option would be for a "confirmatory vote" on whatever deal is finally agreed where the public would be given the choice between accepting the deal or remaining in the EU.Others argue that any further referendum should have the option of leaving the EU without a deal.Either way, a referendum can't just happen automatically.The rules for referendums are set out in a law called the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.There would have to be a new piece of legislation to make a referendum happen and to determine the rules, such as who would be allowed to vote.It couldn't be rushed through, because there has to be time for the Electoral Commission to consider and advise on the referendum question.The question is then defined in the legislation.Once the legislation has been passed, the referendum couldn't happen immediately either.There would have to be a statutory "referendum period" before the vote takes place.Experts at University College London's Constitution Unit suggest that the minimum time for all of the required steps above is about 22 weeks.5.Call a general election Theresa May could decide the best way out of the deadlock would be to hold an early general election.She doesn't have the power just to call an election.But, as in 2017, she could ask MPs to vote for an early election under the terms of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act.Two-thirds of all MPs would need to support the move.The earliest date for the election would be 25 working days later but it could be after that - the prime minister would choose the precise date.6.Another no-confidence vote The government survived a vote of no confidence on 16 January by 325 votes to 306.Labour could table another no confidence motion at any time.Under the Fixed Term Parliaments Act 2011, UK general elections are only supposed to happen every five years.The next one is due in 2022.But a vote of no confidence lets MPs vote on whether they want the government to continue.The motion must be worded: "That this House has no confidence in Her Majesty's Government."If a majority of MPs vote for the motion then it starts a 14-day countdown.If during that time the current government or any other alternative government cannot win a new vote of confidence, then an early general election would be called.That election cannot happen for at least 25 working days.7.No Brexit The European Court of Justice has ruled that it would be legal for the UK to unilaterally revoke Article 50 to cancel Brexit (without the need for agreement from the other 27 EU countries).With the government still committed to Brexit, it's very likely that a major event such as a further referendum or change of government would have to happen before such a move.It's not totally clear what the process would be.But an act of Parliament calling for Article 50 to be revoked would probably be sufficient.Other possibilities Theresa May has said she will step down if her deal is passed.Having already survived a challenge to her leadership, there is no way she can be forced out by her party until December - under the Conservative Party rules.But she could still choose to resign if she can't get her deal through and she's not prepared to change course.That would trigger a Conservative leadership campaign which would result in the appointment of a new prime minister.She might also come under pressure to resign if MPs pass a "censure motion" - that would be a bit like a no-confidence vote but without the same automatic consequences.Again this could lead to a change in prime minister or even a change in government.Whoever ended up in charge would still face the same basic range of Brexit options though.
Brexit: How do European elections work?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The European Union (EU) has agreed a Brexit delay until the end of October and preparations have started to take part in the European elections on 23 May.Prime Minister Theresa May says if a deal gets through Parliament before that date, the UK will not participate.But it seems likely that the UK will still be in the EU at that point.What is the European Parliament?The European Parliament is directly elected by EU voters.It is responsible, along with the Council of Ministers from member states, for making laws and approving budgets.It also plays a role in the EU's relations with other countries, including those wishing to join the bloc.Its members represent the interests of different countries and different regions within the EU.How are its members elected?Every five years, EU countries go to the polls to elect members of the European Parliament (MEPs).Each country is allocated a set number of seats, roughly depending on the size of its population.The smallest, Malta (population: around half a million) has six members sitting in the European Parliament while the largest, Germany (population: 82 million) has 96.At the moment there are 751 MEPs in total and the UK has 73.Candidates can stand as individuals or they can stand as representatives of one of the UK's political parties.Once elected, they represent different regions of the country, again according to population.The north-east of England and Northern Ireland have three MEPs each while the south-east of England, including London, has 18.While most UK MEPs are also members of a national party, once in the European Parliament they sit in one of eight political groups which include MEPs from across the EU who share the same political affiliation.Member states can run elections to the European Parliament according to their own national laws and traditions, but they must stick to some common rules.MEPs must be elected using a system of proportional representation - so, for example, a party which gains a third of the votes wins a third of the seats.Turnout in the UK for European Parliament elections is low both by EU standards and by the standards of other UK elections.The last time they were held in 2014, 36% of those eligible to vote did so, compared with 43% in the EU as a whole.That compares with 66% turnout at the following year's general election.In 2016, 56% of the electorate voted in the Scottish Parliament elections, 45% in the Welsh Assembly and 54% in the Northern Ireland Assembly.In local elections in England, turnout varies depending largely on what other elections are taking place on the same day, sometimes dipping as low as the European elections turnout and sometimes rising close to the level of general elections.Elections to European Parliament How much do elections cost?The last time European elections were held in 2014, the UK spent 109m on them.The main costs were running the poll itself (securing polling stations and venues to run counts) and mailing out candidate information and polling cards.The government has said that if the UK does not end up participating in the 2019 elections, it will reimburse local returning officers - the people responsible for running elections - for any expenses already paid.What happens if the UK leaves?The EU is planning to reduce the overall number of seats in the parliament from 751 to 705 when the UK leaves.There will be a reallocation of 27 of the UK's seats to 14 other member states that are currently underrepresented.And the rest will be set aside with the possibility of being allocated to any new member states that join in the future.The EU has already passed legislation to do this, but it does not take effect until the UK leaves.The number of seats is capped in law at 751.The European Commission had advised that as long as the UK made a decision to take part in the European elections by mid-April, this reallocation would be reversed.But what if the UK elects MEPs and then passes a deal to leave the EU?In that case, the UK MEPs would not take their seats, leaving vacancies.The House of Commons Library says that extra MEPs could potentially be elected on "stand-by" in some member states but not take up their seats until the UK leaves the EU.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit Halloween deadline spooks Europe's newspapers:::::The flexible Brexit extension until Halloween given to the UK by EU leaders prompts a spirited response from Europe's papers.But it's what the wrangling in Brussels means for EU unity ahead of European Parliament elections next month that preoccupies many in the media.For France's Le Monde, it's a "Halloween Brexit... due on 31 October, the Anglo-Saxon holiday of pumpkins and witches".It says President Emmanuel Macron backed Prime Minister Theresa May's request for a short delay until 30 June but "was forced to compromise".The leaders finally split the difference with a typically European compromise: "they cut the pumpkin in half".France's Libration believes the extension came at the cost of breaking the united front of EU leaders."This increasingly incomprehensible waltz of dates shows that the UK has succeeded in exporting its byzantine internal battles to Brussels.For this summit broke to pieces the nice, united European front which held together, for better or for worse, for three years."Libration says the 27 EU leaders have raised the risk of "allowing the British to weigh in on the choice of the future presidents of the EU Commission, Parliament, European Council and the European Central Bank, as well as on discussions regarding the 2020 budget and financial prospects for 2021-2027"."Which is to say, they are giving London a capacity for nuisance which it could not have dared dream of."Image copyright Liberation Germany's Die Welt agrees the effect of Brexit is that "the alliance of the 27 member states is crumbling"."The diverging 'Brexit philosophy' in Paris and Berlin is obvious.With his hard line towards London, Macron wants to scare populists in his own country about similar anti-EU plans.Berlin, on the other hand, sees long-term damage in a lacking willingness to compromise, which could truly bring the populists onto the scene."In the Netherlands, Algemeen Dagblad says Europe is in a very difficult position."Everybody agrees that a no-deal Brexit is undesirable for all parties The EU, facing the prospect of European parliamentary elections in May, does not want to be perceived as the bad guy dropping the UK into misery."Other papers take a very tough tone towards Britain.Barcelona-based La Vanguardia says: "The extension discussed through an intense debate at an informal summit in Brussels is the second one and should be final.The British decided to leave the EU by their own volition," in a post-summit editorial headlined "Brexit and the patience of the EU".In Italy, there's recognition of the EU's tough choices.For Il Sole 24 Ore, "the 27 want to rule out a dramatic, hard Brexit, but they also want to avoid Britain's permanence in the Union, one foot in and the other out, impacting on European affairs".An alternative take that cannot be allowed to slip through the net comes from Patrick Smyth in the Irish Times who warns of the very real threat of a no-eel Brexit.He's talking about the transhipment of live species - in this case eels from Lough Erne in Northern Ireland - to the Republic, and the broader point of importing animal-based food products into the EU.Image copyright The Irish Times "It is true that the fate of the eels can be said to be small beer compared with the impact on the Irish economy of a no-deal Brexit.But it is an illustration of the breadth of the potential impact."While the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit may have receded, he says, "we may well be back all too shortly facing up for real to a dreadful prospect in which, among other issues of greater import, the fate of eels and ham sandwiches will again be on the order of the day."BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.
The hustings to be our next prime minister, in all but name:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Matt Hancock and Penny Mordaunt were on the panel Nowhere in the official billing for this event did the word "hustings" appear, but it had the distinct feel of just that.Conservatives gathered in a room in Parliament dripping with history, to talk about the future.The wallpaper in the Jubilee Room was designed by a bloke who died in 1852 - Augustus Pugin.The people there had designs on the 2020s and beyond.And, perhaps, on leading us into that decade.This was a gathering organised by the Tory think tank Onward - which presented research concluding that age is the new dividing line in British politics and the Conservatives are appealing to fewer and fewer younger people.The research is stark.Onward's report said 83% of Conservative voters are now over the age of 45 and just 4% are under the age of 24 years old."The 'tipping point age' - the median age at which a voter is more likely to be Conservative than Labour - is now 51 years old, up from 47 at the 2017 general election."Before the 2017 campaign, the tipping point was 34 years old," it adds.The brand is so toxic among many younger women, the organisers said, the party did not even "pass rudimentary hygiene" tests for them.Add to that, they said, the UK was urbanising, and people who moved to cities tended to become more left wing, "shifting the soul of the Conservative Party from Kensington to North Yorkshire".No denials Among those listening to the presentation are two cabinet ministers, teased by everyone else as leadership contenders when Theresa May stands down as prime minister.When the words were uttered, there was the odd awkward shuffle or looking down at notes from International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Health Secretary Matt Hancock.But no denial.And both agreed the central conclusions of the research amounted to a "kick up the arse" for the Conservative Party.Incidentally, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Tom Tugendhat, was also on the discussion panel - although he suggested others were contenders rather than him.Image copyright AFP Image caption Tom Tugendhat also attended the event The pitch from Mr Hancock, who voted Remain, but said Brexit had to be delivered, went like this: "I'd like to change the subject."We need to talk about everything else.Not just Brexit.We need to look and feel like a party that is a champion of modern Britain."We can do that without changing the name.You can do it by providing the policies, the tone and the subject matter."Signs of contest to come Yes, Brexit was the elephant in the room, acknowledged as it had to be, while it was universally hoped that one day, eventually, it might be possible for politicians to actually talk about other stuff.Environment Secretary Michael Gove had hoped to do just that here, but pulled out at the last minute because, you guessed it, he was negotiating with Labour about Brexit.Ms Mordaunt voted Leave, but went out of her way to appeal to some who had voted in the opposite direction to her: "Those who, in my view, showed the greatest act of patriotism over the last few years weren't Leave voters."It was Remain voters who accepted the result."Because believe it or not they have faith in this institution and in our democratic traditions.And at times like this we are testing those institutions to the absolute limit."Classic signs of the contest to come were there to be witnessed.Mr Hancock appeared to address the camera at the back of the room, rather than those of us gathered within it.Ms Mordaunt started her spiel with the story of Femi, a disabled computer coder, aged 11.A classic of political communication - grounding a message in the story of an individual they have met.This was a party asking serious questions about the future, and its place within it.But it also amounted to this: pre-season training for the competition to come.The first evidence, in public, of the contest that awaits us.The battle to be our next prime minister.
Unhappiness with politics 'at 15-year high':::::Image copyright PA Image caption Politicians are now less trusted to act in the public interest than bankers The public's dissatisfaction with how government is working is at a 15-year high, an influential study of political engagement suggests.Levels of unhappiness are now greater than in the wake of the MPs' expenses scandal, the Hansard Society found.More than half of the 1,200 people questioned thought the UK was in decline and needed a "strong leader who is willing to break the rules".And more than 40% said they could support new parties with radical ideas.The Hansard Society's 16th Audit of Political Engagement was carried out in early December, before the extent of the current Commons deadlock over Brexit became apparent.But it found that MPs were less trusted to handle Brexit than judges and civil servants, while banks were more trusted to act in the public interest than MPs, ministers or political parties.The survey of 1,198 adults, carried out by Ipsos-Mori, found falling levels of confidence in the political system and the belief that the public can influence decision-making and change the country for the better.'Room for improvement' The proportion of respondents who believed the system of government required either "quite a lot" or a "great deal" of improvement rose above 70% for the first time - to 72%.This was 12 points higher than when the annual research first took place in 2004 and three points higher than in 2010 - when it hit 69% in the aftermath of the furore over MPs' expenses claims.Institutions and individuals both came in for their share of blame.Nearly 40% of respondents agreed that "neither the system nor the people making the decisions" were good enough, as opposed to 15% who said the people in power were good but the "system prevents them from making the right decisions".On Brexit, 79% of respondents had little or no confidence in political parties' ability to sort it out, while 75% said they were too divided to act in the national interest.Confidence levels in civil servants and judges were higher, at 40% and 49% respectively, than for individual MPs (25%) and ministers (26%).'Important questions' While one in three of those questioned still considered themselves to be a "fairly or very strong" supporter of an established political party, 43% said they would consider backing parties with radical ideas which had not been in power before.Some 54% said they agreed that the UK needed "a strong leader willing to break the rules" - against 23% who disagreed.And 42% of respondents said they believed many of the UK's problems could be dealt with more effectively if the government did not have to worry so much about votes in Parliament.While support for referendums to solve big political questions has declined sharply since 2016, 55% of those questioned still had faith in them as opposed to 39% who did not.Ruth Fox, director of the Hansard Society, said the findings raised "some pretty important questions about how people feel about our democracy at the moment"."We are seeing some anti-democratic sentiments coming through, through the frustration that the public have got with the politicians and the parties," she told the BBC's Politics Live.On a more positive note, she said core indicators of engagement - such as certainty to vote and interest and knowledge of politics - remained stable at average or above-average levels compared with previous years.The survey found 80% of those who voted Remain in the 2016 referendum were "absolutely certain" to vote again in a future referendum or election, compared with 64% of Leave voters.
Council elections: Why don't people vote?:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Council elections: Why don't two thirds of people vote?People are being urged to register to vote in the local elections by 12 April, but only about a third use their ballot.What is putting them off?More than 8,000 local councillors up and down England are being elected to 248 councils on 2 May, with the power to decide and scrutinise policy and spending on everything from bin collections to protecting vulnerable children.Yet turnout in local elections has been low for years.Just over one in three registered voters actually took part in the elections in 2018 and there were some areas where it was barely one in four.In Hartlepool, just over 24% of the 70,455 registered voters returned a ballot.This includes spoiled and rejected papers.The council holds elections three years out of every four, with 11 of its 33 seats up for the vote each time.Even in the areas where turnout was highest, only one council - Richmond-upon-Thames - saw more than half of people cast a vote.And of the 10 areas with the highest turnouts in 2018, six are not holding elections this year.Why don't some people vote?Voters in Hartlepool's Manor House ward, where just over 16% of voters turned out in 2018, told the BBC it was a mixture of apathy, a belief that nothing would change, disillusionment with national and local politics and having "no one party that sticks out" Rachael Farrington, founder of Voting Counts - a campaign to encourage voters to register - said: "Many of the people we speak to feel there is a disconnect between politics and their everyday lives.Everyone has issues they care about, from local planning and leisure facilities to bin collections and schools, but it can be difficult to identify how local councils operate and affect these issues."There is also little national attention paid to the role councils and councillors play in communities.While national politics continues to dominate headlines it can appear that change can only happen via Westminster - and those making decisions at a local level are neglected of the due attention, and scrutiny, they deserve."Do we have too many elections?The official data shows turnout improves dramatically when voting takes place on the same day as a General Election and people are choosing their MPs and the government.In 2017, the snap general election was not held until a month after the local elections and turnout in the council vote stayed about a third.Almost four out of 10 councils holding elections on 2 May elect their councillors by "thirds".This means they hold an election for one third of their councillors three years out of every four, rather than putting everyone up for the vote at once.Jess Garland of the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) said frequent elections where not a lot changed could put people off."There's not one big election day where everyone comes out and there's a large buzz," she said, "but there is a lot that can and must be done to ensure every voice is heard and every vote counts."The ERS has also criticised the voting system, saying the "one-person-takes-all" system made people feel like they had to vote tactically and led to "too many safe seats"."When you have one party dominating in an area it can be hugely off-putting, with many people feeling like their votes don't count and it's not worth turning out," Ms Garland said.Why should you vote?Getty Local elections 2019 What's at stake on 2 May 8,425 Council seats up for election 248local authorities 5 directly elected council mayors 1combined authority mayor Source: Electoral Commission Michael Sani from the campaign group Bite The Ballot said: "Local government decides what they do with the money provided to them by central government."This means it is crucial to vote in these elections in order to have a say on your local community.Voting in local elections also sends a message to the national parties that you are active and they can no longer overlook your needs and priorities."Ms Farrington added: "Your local council has an impact on many of the services you see and use every day, including housing, transport and public spaces and services.Choices made by the council will have visible impacts on your community, so engaging in local elections is the best way to have your say over who is making these decisions."Local councils set the rates of council tax for your area, these rates have a direct impact on your income as well as the services in your area."Councillors represent a much smaller group of people than MPs do, that means your single vote is more likely to make an impact on the result."You may also be interested in: Who can vote?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption #Dogsatpollingstations always gets people talking on Twitter but only a third of people vote in council elections To vote in local elections a person must be registered to vote, 18 years or over on polling day and also be: A British citizen, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen, or a citizen of the EU Resident in the UK Not subject to a legal incapacity to vote, such as serving prisoners The Electoral Commission has been running a campaign on social media to encourage people to register by the deadline of Friday 12 April, even attempting to drum up interest by using the hashtag #dogsatpollingstations, which has become popular in recent years with people sharing photographs of their dogs when they go to vote.Chris Hinde from the Electoral Commission said: "It only takes five minutes to register to vote online - time that you might otherwise spend waiting for the kettle to boil or a bus to arrive.So if you want to make sure your voice is heard, go online and register now."
Extinction Rebellion: The climate protesters who want to get arrested:::::Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Extinction Rebellion's fight against climate change is making headlines Protest group Extinction Rebellion's fight against climate change is making headlines - most recently when they stripped almost naked in the House of Commons.The Victoria Derbyshire programme went behind the scenes with the group, which urges people to break the law to save the world."Troublemakers change the world," says Roger Hallam, one the group's founders."When they're starting to call you troublemakers, you're starting to get some traction, right?"Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible.Since its launch last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament.Critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.Mr Hallam is unrepentant: "If you're a trade union, everyone knows that when you first go on strike everyone's going, 'Troublemakers.'But then you have to state your case, which is, 'If you don't get this sorted, we're going to die.'"We filmed members as they blocked traffic in central London - playing cat and mouse with the police - and as young members glued themselves to the entrance of a fracking conference.Civil disobedience Image caption Group founder Roger Hallam says he has spent years studying how to achieve social change It has three core demands: for the government to "tell the truth about climate change", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress.Mr Hallam has spent years researching how to achieve social change through radical movements."Mass participation and civil disobedience maximise the chance of social change in this context," he explains."It doesn't mean it's guaranteed, it just means it's massively more likely to be effective than sending emails and doing conventional campaigning.And it's significantly more effective than using violence."He estimates that thousands of people will need to be arrested before the government will take notice.So far, 222 people have been arrested for offences relating to the protests."The police will go to government and say, 'We're not doing it anymore,'" says Mr Hallam."They're not there to start arresting 84-year-old grannies or 10-year-old kids, there has to be a political solution."Non-violent Image caption The group was given its office in London by a supporter The group's headquarters is in a slightly unexpected spot, the top of a corporate building in Euston which also houses a construction company and a fashion brand.It was given to them after one of their members approached a corporate landlord and said: "We're not going to be around in 10 years, let us do something about it."He gave it to them, in effect, for free.At a training event for new joiners, a debate is held on what counts as violence - Extinction Rebellion is a non-violent organisation.In a role-play exercise, they learn how to deal with angry members of the public - the people they are often obstructing during protests.They are also taught what to do when they are arrested - how to make it more difficult for police to pick them up and their legal rights once they get to the police station.Sign up for a weekly chat about climate change on Facebook Messenger The Taxpayers' Alliance, which campaigns for lower taxes, says their behaviour is "clearly irresponsible and wasting police time".The group's chief executive John O'Connell said: "They should stop these juvenile actions and express themselves peaceably, and not resort to playground politics."Does Extinction Rebellion really think ruining people's day by blocking their way is going to change their minds?"Yes, it is," says Mr Hallam."The only way people change is by getting upset.No change is possible unless there's major emotional distress.And you can do that violently and non-violently... it's a no-brainer, that's how society changes."No arrests?Image caption Lorna Greenwood says traditional forms of campaigning are not working At their Downing Street demonstration, which they have called Blood of our Children because they are covering the street with fake blood, 31-year-old Lorna Greenwood is demonstrating with the group for the first time."I don't want to be standing here, six months pregnant, breaking the law," she tells the crowd."I don't want to spend my weekend in a police cell, and I don't want to be giving more work to our overstretched and undervalued police force.But I don't feel like I have any other options."In fact, there are no arrests during this demonstration - the police do not always give the group the results it hopes."The whole point is to get arrested - I've come from Manchester to get arrested," says one disappointed man.But there are journalists everywhere which is also what the group wants - the press covering them and telling people they exist.Later this month, the group plans to blockade London in its biggest action yet - it says its members will sit in the streets until politicians listen.Farhana Yamin, an international climate change lecturer and environmental lawyer, is one of the people prepared to be arrested for the cause.She explains: "I've got four kids and the eldest one, every year she gets older and I feel, 'Where's the progress?'All that time I spent as a lawyer and a professional away from her, what does that count for?"Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme on Facebook and Twitter -

Brexit: What are EU countries doing to prepare for no deal?:::::Political deadlock remains over Brexit because Theresa May cannot get her deal through Parliament.The UK government has stepped up its planning for leaving the EU without a deal, covering areas such as transport, healthcare, energy, food and water.What is the EU doing to prepare for this scenario?European Commission The European Commission has set out its readiness for the "increasingly likely" chances of no deal.It covers basic arrangements for road hauliers, flights and financial services.The Commission reiterated that these would not replicate the conditions of EU membership and said that it would be "required to immediately apply its rules and tariffs at its borders".The document, however, did not mention what would happen to the Irish border.The Commission has a website which links to advice from all of the EU member countries.Here are summaries of the measures taken by some of them.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The 499km (310-mile) Northern Ireland border would be hard to police Ireland The Republic of Ireland has been preparing for Brexit for a long time.It's clear that a no-deal Brexit would raise serious questions for the Irish economy.Ireland passed no deal Brexit legislation in February, which covers a number of important issues such as allowing for pension and other benefits to be paid, for cross-border rail and bus services to continue and for citizens to access services across the border as they do now.But, the most important issue - the future of the land border with Northern Ireland - does not feature in the legislation.Ireland, the UK and the EU all say they want to avoid any physical infrastructure at the border.But an EU official said checks on goods would need to be done and the EU and Ireland were working on carrying them out away from the border.In the event of no deal, the EU would add new shipping links between Ireland and ports in France, Belgium and the Netherlands; the EU says funding for this would be a priority in its budget.The Irish government has plans to expand port infrastructure in Dublin and Rosslare, to allow inspections of trucks arriving from the UK and of live animals, and to accommodate extra staff.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption France is creating extra facilities in Calais, a vital hub for trade with the UK France The French customs service has been preparing for Brexit for some time and is planning to recruit 700 extra staff by the end of 2020.It has also produced detailed online information for businesses with advice on transporting live animals, fish, chemical products, medicines and waste.France is spending 50m (43m) on expanding port infrastructure to accommodate additional officials and customs checks.If there is no deal, new border inspection posts will be needed to check food, plants and live animals.For veterinary checks, 117 new inspectors have already been trained after a fast-track programme and are ready to take up their posts.The majority will be based in Calais.The French parliament passed a law in January to give the government (rather than parliament) the power to introduce new measures by emergency decree to cope with a no-deal Brexit.The law covers, among other things, the rights of UK nationals living and working in France.Further advice for citizens and companies is available on the French government's website.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption German VWs bound for export: they could face 10% tariffs in the UK under no-deal Germany Germany has produced less detailed public information than France, which has led to some frustration among business leaders and opposition parties.The German government has a special Brexit cabinet, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.It says it is well prepared for all eventualities.Behind the scenes, Germany is making many of the same preparations as France, including the recruitment of 900 extra customs staff.In areas of social security, tax issues and financial services, the German government has initiated new legislation with the aim of creating legal certainty if there is no deal.But the government says its biggest priority is protecting the interests of citizens on both sides of the Channel.In the event of no deal, the government would give British citizens living in Germany an initial period of three months during which their rights to live and work there would not change.However, they would have to apply for residence permits during that period.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Rotterdam handles a vast amount of cargo going to and from the UK The Netherlands The Dutch have been busy.Last year the government said more than 900 customs officials and an extra 145 vets would be needed for the Port of Rotterdam.The foreign ministry has published a no-deal Brexit impact document which says that this outcome would be "accompanied by disruptions and problems".It says 321 customs officials are ready to be deployed as well as an extra 14 border guards to carry out checks on UK nationals entering the country.The main international airport, Schiphol, will have more than 100 extra customs staff.UK passport holders will face stricter checks, the airport says.Some 10.5m people fly between Schiphol and the UK every year.British nationals and their family members who were legally resident in the Netherlands before the UK's departure would retain their right to live, study and work in the Netherlands for 15 months, through a temporary residence permit.The government estimated that around 45,000 British nationals and their family members currently have residence rights, with around 20,000 of them working in the Netherlands.British students already studying in the Netherlands will be able to continue on the same terms as before, but anyone planning to study there after a no-deal Brexit will have to pay much higher tuition fees.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption An Ostend fish stall: Brexit means extra food inspections in Belgium Belgium An extra 141 customs officers are being deployed in the port cities of Ghent, Antwerp and Zeebrugge to cope with the impact of Brexit.Antwerp, Europe's second-biggest port, currently has 3,400 customs staff.The greatest impact is expected in Zeebrugge, as 45% of the port's traffic is with the UK.Belgium's government says it will maintain current rights for UK nationals -

the highest number in Europe, outside the UK.There are many pensioners among the UK nationals in Spain.The Spanish measures include healthcare provisions, stating that the current conditions will continue provided the UK government reciprocates for Spaniards living in the UK.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Gibraltar remains a thorny issue between Spain and the UK Gibraltar The Spanish plans would also cover Gibraltar, although certain additional provisions may apply, including Spain's power of veto over issues relating to the British Overseas Territory in any future agreement between the UK and the EU.An estimated 9,000 Spanish citizens work in Gibraltar, and the Madrid government says the measures would be contingent on them receiving the same rights as British citizens.The Government of Gibraltar's no-deal planning has been focused on possible delays at the border with Spain, which is crossed by thousands of people every day.It has also issued a number of notices with advice to citizens on healthcare, driving, studying, financial services, mobile phone roaming and other issues.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: Why a long extension worries Europe:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May met Angela Merkel in Berlin ahead of the EU summit The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has urged European Union leaders not to humiliate Theresa May when they discuss her latest request to delay Brexit.But the other 27 EU countries (known as the EU27) may still impose tough conditions on any extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, to ensure that they protect their own interests.So what do they have in mind?The EU's main initial demand is that the UK fulfils its commitment to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May, if Brexit hasn't happened by then.Draft conclusions for today's summit in Brussels say that if the UK were to fail to hold the elections, it would automatically leave the EU - without a deal if necessary - on 1 June.But even if those elections take place, and UK MEPs attend the first session of the new parliament in July, there is still concern in some quarters that a disgruntled British government could prevent the EU making progress on a series of important issues.Different member states have different opinions on how serious a threat this is.But it is certainly an important part of the discussion.Theresa May has already pledged that the UK will remain a "constructive and responsible" member state, and abide by its "duty of sincere co-operation" with the rest of the EU.This is a form of words that carries weight in Brussels, but it doesn't bind any future UK government to act in the same way.What else is on the EU's mind?The EU has a series of big decisions to make in the coming months.It doesn't want Brexit to get in the way.To begin with, there is a changing of the guard at the top of the EU's political structures.A new president of the European Commission has to be nominated by EU leaders, and approved by the European Parliament, in time to take over on 1 November from Jean-Claude Juncker, who is standing down.A month later, on 1 December, a new European Council president will take office, succeeding Donald Tusk.Both of these appointment, though, involve qualified majority voting - in other words they don't have to be approved unanimously by all member states.That would limit the ability of an unhappy UK government to block critical EU business."We've looked very carefully," a senior EU official says, "and in reality there aren't many things you can veto over the coming year."But there are other important issues looming for the EU notably on the size and shape of the next seven year budget for 2021-27.Negotiations on the budget will start to intensify under the new Commission, although final decisions won't be made for at least a year.The budget does need unanimous approval.That is one of the reasons why any Brexit extension will almost certainly, as Mr Tusk has suggested, be "no longer than a year".Brexit has been taking up far too much time already.It has diverted the EU from a focus on other subjects, and the leaders of the EU27 would rather concentrate on their own future than on the internal debates of a country that is trying to leave.So the leaders will have to decide how many conditions they impose on a Brexit extension, and they will want to hear Mrs May repeat her written pledge of co-operation in person.Throughout the Brexit process, the unity of the EU27 has been a consistent factor.But there is now a difficult balance to strike.Does there need to be a formal review process during an extension, or is a European Council decision to "remain seized of the matter" (EU jargon for paying close attention to it) enough?"I think the extension should be as short as possible," German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the German parliament."But it should be long enough to create calm, so we don't have to meet every two weeks to talk about the same subject," she added.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
No-deal Brexit: What is the UK government doing to prepare?:::::Image copyright Gareth Fuller/PA Image caption A section of the M20 had been reserved exclusively for lorries as part of no-deal Brexit plans The European Union (EU) has agreed to the UK's request for a further Brexit delay.Under the new timetable, the UK's scheduled departure from the EU is now 31 October 2019 - seven months after the original deadline.Despite this extra time being granted, the UK government says it will "continue to make all necessary preparations" for a no-deal Brexit.This follows reports that official planning for that scenario was being stood down.The government adds that plans "will evolve and adapt" but will not stop, while the chance of leaving the EU without an agreement remains.So what are the government's no-deal contingency plans?Operation Yellowhammer The government's no-deal Brexit contingency plan is code-named Operation Yellowhammer, after a species of bird.First launched in June 2018, it covers 12 areas including transport, healthcare, energy, food and water.It is based on worst-case scenario assumptions - delays at the border over a six-month period, increased immigration checks at EU border posts, reduction in choice and availability of food, and potential price increases for utilities, food and fuel.Operation Yellowhammer isn't the government's only Brexit contingency plan, but sits alongside broader preparations.This is to "reflect the fact that it would not be possible for departments to plan for every eventuality", according to a report by the National Audit Office (NAO), and that the government would need a way of taking control and quickly coordinating different agencies to handle any short-term disruption.Through Operation Yellowhammer, the government has been looking at what existing powers it could use to prioritise fuel to essential services or to relax rules limiting the working hours of HGV drivers, for example.As part the contingency plans, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has made 3,500 troops, including reserves, available to be deployed if necessary.It has also set up an operations room in a bunker at its main Whitehall building to coordinate efforts in the event of a no-deal Brexit.The MoD will not comment on exactly what role the troops could perform, only that they will "support government planning".Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Theresa May talking to soldiers.The MoD says 3,500 troops will be available to be deployed in the event of a no-deal Brexit if necessary In its report on Yellowhammer, published in March, the NAO said some no-deal preparations might not be ready in time.For example, the report said the government did not have enough time to put in place all of the infrastructure, systems and people required for fully effective border operations on day one.The cost of Yellowhammer is part of the 1.5bn allocated by the Treasury to government departments for Brexit preparations.For Yellowhammer to be effective, the NAO says that the "command, control and coordination" structure needs to be in place ahead of the UK leaving the EU.The Cabinet Office refused to tell the BBC whether Operation Yellowhammer was already underway ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit on 12 April.It said it would not provide a running commentary.But what about the government's broader no-deal Brexit plans?Healthcare The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says thousands of medicines have been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU.Suppliers are stockpiling an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual "buffer" stock.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Plans are in place to ensure there is enough essential medicines like insulin The same approach is being taken with vaccines as well as blood and transplant products.The DHSC has also agreed contracts for extra warehouse space with refrigeration capacity to store these supplies.A plane has been chartered to fly in medicines which have short shelf-lives and cannot be stockpiled, like medical radioisotopes used in cancer treatment.Transport The government has previously warned "there could be some freight traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no-deal Brexit".That's because under a no-deal scenario, lorries travelling between the UK and the EU will need to complete custom declarations.On top of this, certain goods from the UK, such as food and plant products, arriving at EU ports may also require physical checks, under EU single market rules.The Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day and the worry is that extra checks could lead to bottlenecks, leading to many miles of tailbacks.Independent modelling has estimated that two minutes of extra processing time for each lorry would lead to tailbacks of 17 miles.To avoid significant disruption, Operation Brock is the name of the plan to hold up to 2,000 lorries heading for mainland Europe in a queue while keeping other traffic flowing around it (ie a contraflow system).A fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time.If further capacity was still required, a "last resort" would be to turn the M26 into a temporary lorry park.The M26 is a 10-mile motorway connecting the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20, near West Malling.Under this scenario, the M26 would be closed to normal road users and lorries would park on the carriageway.Kent County Council believes this option could accommodate an additional 2,000 lorries.Roadworks have been taking place to install a temporary steel barrier on the M20 that would be used for Operation Brock.On 11 April, Highways England said it had scaled back its plan following the Brexit delay to 31 October.It said it would remove the contraflow on the M20 to "restore capacity on the motorway in time for the Easter bank holiday weekend."Kent County Council has also issued advice to local schools suggesting pupils and staff could be moved inside school buildings if extra lorry traffic causes air pollution to increase.Food The government has published a "tariff schedule" - a list of the taxes placed on different types of products when they are imported from other countries - which has removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit.It will mean some goods from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper.And some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive.The British Retail Consortium has warned that there could be gaps on supermarket shelves if there is disruption at the border.Irish border The UK government published on 13 March its contingency plan to avoid a hard border (ie physical infrastructure) in Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Under the plans, the UK will not bring in new checks or controls or require customs declarations for any goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland in the event of no deal.Image copyright Getty Images But this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer term solutions.The UK government says its contingency plan recognises "the unique social, political and economic circumstances of Northern Ireland".To protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked.The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself.But it has not specified exactly where they will take place.It remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland.Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market (such as at the Irish land border).However, the Irish government says there are "no plans for Border Inspection Posts on the border with Northern Ireland".Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Why UK child poverty targets won’t be met:::::Image copyright Getty Images Twenty years ago, then Prime Minister Tony Blair pledged to end child poverty in a generation, at a speech in central London.He called it a "20-year mission".Two decades and three prime ministers later, BBC Reality Check looks at what has happened to child poverty.What counts as poverty?If someone asked you what poverty was, you might think about how far someone's pay packet goes.Can they afford their household bills?Can they ever go on holiday?But rather than looking at how someone is making ends meet, the main way poverty is assessed is by using a relative measure - "relative poverty".It's calculated by taking the median income in the country - that's the midpoint where half of the overall population have income more than that amount and half have less.It was 507 a week in 2017-18, or 437 after housing costs.Then you take 60% of this middle amount and anyone who has less income than this is considered to be living in relative poverty.In 1998-99, 34% of children in the UK were living in relative-poverty households.Today, this proportion is 30%, which represents about 4.1 million children.How many children are in relative poverty?% of children in relative low income households after housing costs Statistics on income after housing costs and benefits received are more widely used as this gives a better idea of how much disposable income someone might have.But, some say relative poverty is flawed as a measure because the poverty line moves when average income changes.In times of recession, for example, when lots of people's wages decrease, relative poverty rates improve.That's because the gap between the median and lowest incomes is less but low-income families might not be any better off.Figures are also published on "absolute" poverty.Instead of comparing people's incomes with the average for the current year, these use a fixed year - 2010-11 - to track how many people have been in poverty over an extended period of time.This can help avoid the problems of a drop in incomes in one year changing the poverty line.But absolute poverty doesn't reflect how, if standards are rising quickly for the rest of society, the poorest are being left behind - because it is fixed on a middle income from almost a decade ago.On this measurement, the number of children in poverty has reduced more quickly, falling to 26% in 2017-18.How many children are in absolute poverty?% of children in absolute low income households after housing costs Analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC head of statistics With many different definitions of the poverty line, it's easier to understand what they mean by looking at pounds and pence.Here's what the version you'll hear most often from politicians, analysts and campaigners - relative poverty - means in real money.A one-child-one-parent family is poor unless they have more than 200 a week left to spend after paying their tax and housing costs.For a two-parent-two-child family, it's 360.That's not the dollar-a-day often referred to when talking about global poverty.In a rich country such as the UK, it's more about whether someone can do what all the people around them do and still make ends meet.In 2016, the Conservatives removed poverty targets established by Labour in 2010.The government said basing policies on "relative" poverty simply led to efforts to push income above the poverty line rather than tackling the underlying causes of poverty.Labour's targets were also based on incomes before housing costs were accounted for.Attempts have been made to agree an alternative measure of poverty - whether their income meets the material needs of a family, such as affording a bedroom for every child over 10 and a school trip once a term.Record high Meanwhile, the proportion of children living in relative poverty risks hitting a record high by the end of the Parliament, according to the Resolution Foundation.In a recent report, the research group said it was projected to rise to 37% by 2023-24.The foundation blames economic factors and government policy.It said a spike in inflation in 2017 and weak wage growth for lower-paid workers have put pressure on household budgets.Speaking to BBC News last year, Mr Blair said that efforts to reduce child poverty required a "new approach" to infrastructure, housing and investment in new technologies, saying these would help reduce wage stagnation.Image copyright Getty Images Child Poverty Action Group director of policy Louisa McGeehan said: "By 2021, we will be cutting 40bn a year from our work-and-pensions budget through cuts and freezes to tax credits and benefits and, as a result, we have put so much progress on child poverty into reverse."She also cites cuts to universal credit and the two-child cap on benefits as contributing to poverty rates.This week in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Theresa May said the government is taking poverty "very seriously".She added: "The only sustainable way to tackle poverty is with a strong economy and a welfare system that helps people into work."Since becoming Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd has attempted to soften some benefit cuts introduced under the government's austerity programme, including removing the two-child cap on universal credit for some families.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: EU weighs risks of going into extra time:::::Image copyright AFP Image caption Tense times for Europe: EU leaders Jean-Claude Juncker (L) and Donald Tusk (R), and Germany's Angela Merkel The UK impasse over Brexit casts a cloud of uncertainty over EU leaders meeting for emergency talks in Brussels on Wednesday.The 27 are frustrated with all the Brexit wrangling.They have agreed that 12 April will be the UK exit date, if by then Theresa May still has not got the withdrawal agreement passed by Parliament.So legally the UK could still exit on Friday.But neither the EU27 nor the UK Parliament wants it.An overwhelming majority of MPs voted against no deal.And there is a new complicating factor: European Parliament elections on 23-26 May.So what are Mrs May's EU partners saying?Donald Tusk's 'flextension' European Council President Donald Tusk is proposing a one-year flexible extension ("flextension").It would have a break clause, allowing the UK to exit earlier, if the UK Parliament finally ratifies the withdrawal agreement.The House of Commons has already rejected the agreement three times.The EU27 insists that the withdrawal deal cannot be renegotiated, but the accompanying political declaration - spelling out ambitions for future ties - can be revised.That declaration is not legally binding.There is still scope for the UK to agree, for example, to stay in a permanent customs union.In her Brexit "red lines" Mrs May insisted the UK would pull out of the EU customs union and single market.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.The opposition Labour Party - now in Brexit talks with Mrs May - is worried that any deal to have a softer Brexit, closer to the EU position, could still be scrapped by a future Conservative leader.So why might the EU27 opt for "flextension"?The EU wants to maintain a close partnership with the UK; a disorderly no-deal exit could ruin that The UK would have time to find a new Brexit compromise; it might even remain in the EU after a second referendum Any new EU decision to delay has to be unanimous; one country's veto could trigger no-deal Brexit.French scepticism The French government sees Theresa May's proposal, for the UK to exit on 30 June, as a political manoeuvre to appease MPs at Westminster.The EU27 have previously rejected a 30 June deadline.There is fierce Conservative opposition to the UK participating in the European elections.Exiting on 30 June would mean electing MEPs, but not actually sending them to Brussels, because the new parliament session starts on 2 July.French President Emmanuel Macron, an ardent champion of the EU, is sceptical about any further Brexit delays.One of his MPs, Bruno Bonnell, told the BBC that "we've been giving some delays so far, with no result".With all the turmoil at Westminster, he said, "we have to accept that no deal might be the option".A source close to President Macron also called Mr Tusk's one-year proposal "a clumsy trial balloon".France insists that Mrs May must present a "credible plan" for Brexit.Image copyright AFP Image caption President Macron objects to Theresa May's Brexit "red lines" What are the risks of a long delay for the EU27?Brexit threatens to eat up more of the EU's time, while other issues demand attention, such as the EU budget and new appointments to top jobs in the EU Legally it could be difficult to stop the departing UK still influencing EU policy in key areas The status of British MEPs would be strange - half-in, half-out of the European Parliament Irish border worries Taoiseach (prime minister) Leo Varadkar favours a longer extension.He has warned that a no-deal Brexit would have dire consequences, almost certainly forcing the return of a hard border with Northern Ireland.On this week's summit, he said a country "wouldn't be forgiven" if it vetoed a postponement of Brexit, as that veto would cause hardship to Ireland and other EU countries.But he is against "rolling extensions" like Mrs May's new deadline, "because that just adds to the uncertainty".The backstop in the withdrawal agreement is Dublin's guarantee that the Northern Ireland border will remain open, free of physical infrastructure.Germany fears no-deal Brexit Chancellor Angela Merkel says Germany will do all it can to prevent a no-deal scenario."Where there's a will there's a way.We still hope for an orderly Brexit," she said in Ireland last week.Norbert Rttgen, head of the German parliament's foreign affairs committee, backed Mr Tusk's one-year delay.And Merkel ally Elmar Brok, a veteran of EU politics, said "we now want as long a delay as possible, ideally unlimited".Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte says UK politicians need to "make clear how they would want to use an extension".He has demanded "clarity" on that from Theresa May.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz says the EU has set "very clear deadlines and there is no reason to further extend those deadlines"."Unless the facts in Britain change.But we have not yet reached this point," he added.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki favours a long delay."Six, or nine, or twelve months, these options are acceptable to us," he said.
Was this the weirdest week in Westminster?:::::Image copyright UK Parliament Image caption Some found the week's activities funnier than others Here in Westminster, things haven't been "business as usual" for quite some time.But this week outdid itself, with every day delivering an odd surprise - and the funny reactions to match.These are just some of the weird and wonderful things to have taken place in SW1A over the past five days.Monday: Bumday We all know what it is like - that slow start to the week, the afternoon lull... Then boom!Twelve naked people crash into your office and demand action on climate change.No?Maybe it is just MPs then... On Monday, activists took over the public gallery in the Commons during a debate on indicative Brexit votes, with slogans painted across their bodies.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Semi-naked climate change protester on interrupting Brexit debate.MPs courageously carried on, with the odd reference ad-libbed into their speeches and a hair-raising facial expression or two, as some of the protesters managed to glue themselves to the security glass.It took the police a fair while to unstick the group and carry them off the premises, but the imprints of their backsides remained for some time - both on the glass and in our memories.Tuesday: Crack out the Chilean wine Every week, Theresa May summons her cabinet to No 10 for a chat (row) about the latest direction of the government.These occasions tend to last for about two hours before the top brass can head back to their departments and maybe get on with some non-Brexit related work - Steve Barclay is exempt from this, of course.But on Tuesday, after ministers arrived at Downing Street, the doors were locked and they were stuck in talks for more than seven hours.Think what you could do with seven hours: Watch nearly five football matches Smash through the whole series of Bodyguard Get a healthy amount of sleep But no, these ladies and gentlemen had to come up with an answer to the Brexit deadlock.To stop them telling gossip-hungry journalists what had been decided before she did, Mrs May is said to have shut them up in the cabinet room, confiscated their phones and fed them "cheap Chilean red wine".Wednesday: Message from the gods?As Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn entered into their talks on Wednesday afternoon, it seemed the weather gods were siding with the angry Brexiteers.A previously fine day was shaken by a huge clap of thunder and hailstones crashing on to the pavements, despite spring being well and truly sprung.But the dramatic scenes in the Commons were still to come.For the first time in 39 years, a vote by MPs was tied.It was on an amendment calling for backbenchers to take over business in the House for a fourth day, and the lead-up to the 310-310 result produced a lot of angry exchanges.So how was the impasse solved?Mr Order himself, Speaker John Bercow, got to have the casting vote and he went against the amendment.Cue lots of oohs and aahs from a Commons beside itself with procedure.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Speaker casts deciding vote after dead heat And the day was rounded off by an odd point of order from Tory backbencher Mark Francois after MPs approved a bill - in just one day - forcing the PM to ask the EU for an extension to Brexit.The staunch Leaver chose the run-up to Holy Week to exclaim: "Forgive them Father for they know not what they do."The Lord does work in mysterious ways... Thursday: Here comes the flood The biblical theme continued into Thursday.As MPs debated the introduction of a loan charge, water began to pour into the press gallery above, with journalists sprinting out to avoid damp shoes.While the hacks were tweeting puns about "leaks in Westminster", politicians tried to continue and be heard over the sound of running water.But despite it being a somewhat busy week in Parliament, Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle was forced to suspend the House, eventually adjourning - meaning they all got an early bath.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption House of Commons suspends sitting due to water leak Meanwhile, the Lords were embarking on an epic debate that saw so many votes, peers were up and down from the benches as if they had repeatedly sat on a hedgehog.It was a battle of Brexit, as one side tried to get Thursday's one-day bill through its peer review and the other tried to stop it.The players were "dusting off camp beds" and checking times for breakfast (07:30 BST if you were wondering), promising to debate through the night.But after almost 12 hours, they called it a day and went for a nightcap.Friday: You think it's all over...So far, so normal.But there are still a few hours to go.Maybe it will be locusts next...
Losing votes, losing ministers:::::Image copyright Getty Images It's fair to say that Theresa May has not had the smoothest ride as prime minister.Her job is to run the country, but really for her, it all comes down to Brexit.That was meant to be 29 March.But the UK is still in the EU and there's still no way out which everyone can agree on.Meanwhile, she has been repeatedly defeated in the House of Commons and has lost 20 ministers over her handling of Brexit.Things were very different a couple of years ago.Minority government is tough Theresa May was riding so high in 2017 that she decided to call a general election.The idea was to boost her position even further so she could get on with a nice smooth Brexit.Her gamble backfired.She ended up with 317 MPs - not enough for a majority in Parliament.She managed to scrape together the numbers she needed by teaming up with a party in Northern Ireland called the DUP.But they're not exactly BFFs.They have voted against her Brexit deal and called her negotiations "lamentable".To add insult to injury, four of her MPs have left the Conservative Party.Image caption The PM facing the flak in Parliament Biggest loser?This means it's even harder for her to win votes.She is losing often and losing big - and always on her core policy, Brexit.So far this year, she has had the 1st, 2nd and 5th largest defeats in recent times.Her government has lost in the House of Commons 23 times since December 2017.For context, Margaret Thatcher lost four votes in her 11 years as PM.Tony Blair had four defeats, Gordon Brown had three and David Cameron's coalition government saw six losses.They did have solid majorities though, so it was easier for them to win.You have to go back to the 70s to find other governments which have had more defeats.Prime Minister Harold Wilson lost 25 times in the Commons between 1974 and 1976.The biggest loser crown goes to Jim Callaghan though, with 34 defeats in 3 years from 1976.Ministerial merry-go-round It's normal to have some ministers coming and going over time.Then again it's normally the boss making those decisions - not the other way round.But the independent research group the Institute for Government says that's been "turbocharged since the 2017 election".Thirty-two government ministers have resigned or left their jobs.Some were part of reshuffles or because of other political problems.But 20 quit over Brexit.This shows how utterly divided the party is.And no prizes for guessing which bit of government has been the most unstable...The Department for Exiting the European Union.Only one junior minister from the original team is still working there.Image copyright Getty Images MPs running Parliament Normally the government controls what Parliament debates and which laws are passed.But that's been turned on its head.MPs, including some of her own backbenchers, have taken the power to bring their own laws.They have voted to force the PM to ask for an extension to avoid a no-deal Brexit.Some see this loss of control as the most serious part of this Brexistential crisis.Meanwhile, ordinary business is not getting done.Big announcements for things like housing and education seem to have gone missing.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Things have been bad before though - literally rubbish But actually....So far, so very, very damning.But you don't have to look far back in history to find dramatic moments of crisis that affected people in their everyday lives.In the 1970s Britain was known as the "sick man of Europe" as it ricocheted from one financial crisis to another.In 1974, fuel supplies got so low, businesses were put on a "three-day week".Two years later the value of the pound plummeted and the PM Jim Callaghan had to accept a humiliating 2.3bn bailout from the International Monetary Fund.1978 was known as the "winter of discontent" as everyone from bin men to gravediggers went on strike.By comparison, the economy looks very stable nowadays.Employment figures are the best since records began.The government has launched a long-term plan for the NHS in England.And over the last couple of years, Theresa May has generally got better polling figures than the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.So really how bad are things?It all depends how you measure it.And how you see the world.And how you view Brexit.For some the bigger picture is relatively rosy, but Theresa May's biggest focus has been Brexit.She has not managed to deliver it on time.She has lost control of her government and her Parliament.But, she is dealing with an unusually complicated situation where people on both sides have passionate views.Theresa May could well argue that it's too early to judge her yet.If she manages to get her Brexit deal through soon, she could claim that it's all been worthwhile.But that's a big if.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra -

Brexit delay: What does extension letter say?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The prime minister's original letter, setting out the UK's intention to leave the EU, was handed to Brussels on 29 March 2017 Theresa May has written to the European Union (EU) to request a further delay to Brexit until 30 June.Reality Check examines some of the key passages of the letter addressed to European Council President Donald Tusk.Extension date It is only towards the end of the letter that Mrs May spells out the proposed date for the further extension - 30 June.This is the same date as the prime minister's original request last month, and just so happens to be two days before the new European Parliament meets for the first time.But such a relatively short extension may not be on offer - the talk in other EU capitals has been of a longer extension until the end of this year at the earliest.Mr Tusk is likely to suggest a one-year extension.The EU may well be more receptive, though, to the idea of a get-out clause: it would mean that if a deal were to be approved by MPs and ratified earlier, the UK could leave the EU straightaway.That would suit both sides, and it's another idea that Donald Tusk has been promoting behind the scenes.The PM still hopes a deal can be finalised before voting in the European elections begin on 23 May, but given the divisions in Westminster the timetable for that already looks really tight.It's also worth bearing in mind, given the initial reaction to Mrs May's letter from Paris and other capitals, that granting any extension is not yet a done deal.Withdrawal agreement She is referring here to discussions between the government and Labour - and MPs more broadly - aimed at agreeing a Brexit plan which can be put to a currently deadlocked Parliament.This section is also a reminder for rebellious Conservative backbenchers and the DUP and its leader Arlene Foster: under this prime minister you can forget about reopening the withdrawal agreement and changing the wording of the Irish backstop.The EU has been ruling that out for months.Theresa May tried and failed to get them to change their minds (although her Tory critics say she didn't try hard enough), and now she's emphasised again that the focus for any new suggestions has to be the non-binding political declaration on what the future holds.The votes on various options in the House of Commons are designed to do that - but there's no cast-iron guarantee that a future government wouldn't opt for a change of course.Other options The prime minister is making a promise to the EU that if the House of Commons backs any kind of compromise proposal, the government "stands ready" to abide by that decision - if Labour does the same."Stands ready" isn't quite the same as "will" but it is pretty close.The dilemma for the PM, of course, is that backing a customs union would cross one of her red lines: that the UK must have a fully independent trade policy after Brexit.And membership of the single market, another option, would cross perhaps her reddest line of all - ending the free movement of people from the EU to the UK, and vice versa.Could that be a compromise too far for Theresa May?European elections The prime minister really doesn't want to hold European elections, but here in black and white is a commitment to the EU that preparations for the elections are taking place.That includes making the legal order that sets the date of the poll on 23 May - something that needs to be done by 11 April.The government will hope that this provides reassurance to other EU countries that it will hold the elections if it has to.Downing Street will also hope that election preparations concentrate minds among MPs who are refusing to back the prime minister's deal.'Sincere co-operation' The language here is really important.The prime minister is saying that the UK will not try to block EU business or be obstructive to other countries - something backbench critics, such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, have already suggested could happen.The phrase "duty of sincere co-operation" carries some weight in Brussels, and is designed to reassure the EU that the UK will play by the rules as long as it remains a member state.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit talks: Will Labour push a public vote option?:::::Image copyright PA The view of Labour members seems clear.Polling for a project on party membership - led by Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University - was published at the turn of the year.It suggested more than 70% of Labour's members backed a second referendum.And if it were held, nearly nine out of 10 would vote to remain in the EU.But this wasn't a poll of shadow cabinet members.Nine of Jeremy Corbyn's top team are very, very sceptical of - or opposed to - another referendum.And most of these are his political allies.Public vote, private fears The man he installed as Labour Party chairman - Ian Lavery - is reported to have offered his resignation twice because he broke the party whip and failed to back a referendum in the recent indicative votes.Twice Mr Corbyn refused to accept it.From a Leave-supporting area in north east England, Mr Lavery is convinced Labour would pay a high political price if it is seen to be disrespecting the result of the 2016 referendum.It's interesting that the elections co-ordinator, Andrew Gwynne, who is not as close to Mr Corbyn, takes a similar view.So far, a formulation around the question of a second referendum has just about maintained a show of unity from senior figures in public - though this is now fraying.The form of words deployed is that Labour would support a "public vote" in order to avoid "a hard Tory Brexit" or "no deal".But these caveats now worry supporters of a referendum in the party - including some who sit at Mr Corbyn's top table.The fears are fuelled by the current cross-party talks.Because if Mr Corbyn was to reach a deal with Theresa May which avoids "a hard Tory Brexit", would the referendum commitment melt away?Shadow boxing Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry was so concerned she wrote to shadow cabinet colleagues last night to argue that ditching a public vote on any deal - including one hammered out with the prime minister - would breach party policy and would require a vote of the whole shadow cabinet.At last night's special meeting of shadow ministers, I am told Ms Thornberry's possible leadership ambitions were aired.(She couldn't be there for family reasons).Key figures in Mr Corbyn's office were furious at her intervention.But the party's deputy leader Tom Watson - who doesn't always see eye to eye with the shadow foreign secretary - took to the airwaves to insist: "Our position is we want a confirmatory ballot."It's very difficult for us to move off that because I don't think our party would forgive us if we signed off on Tory Brexit without that kind of concession."Even more uncomfortably for the Labour leader, left-wing allies have written to him to push for a referendum commitment in talks with the prime minister.The eleven signatories include shadow ministers Clive Lewis and Rachael Maskell.They wrote: "We - your supporters - urge you to make a confirmatory public vote your bottom line in negotiations with Theresa May and to fight to bring this government down."Mr Corbyn has said he did raise the "option" of a public vote with Mrs May yesterday and shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said today that a "confirmatory vote" would be discussed at what are being billed as technical discussions between Labour and Conservative frontbenchers.Meaningful policy?Behind the scenes there is what to outsiders will look like a "dance on the head of a pin" argument going on as to what Labour's policy actually is on a public vote - but the interpretation could determine how hard, or otherwise, the referendum is pushed in talks.The motion agreed last autumn at Labour's conference says "should Parliament vote down a Tory Brexit deal, or the talks end in no deal" then there should be a general election.If that doesn't happen, then "Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote".Supporters of a referendum say that Mrs May's "Tory Brexit deal" - as represented by two meaningful votes - has been voted down.So Labour should now be calling unequivocally for a "public vote" on any deal.Sceptics and opponents stress, on the other hand, that it should still be a last resort to prevent no deal, or another attempt to get Mrs May's unrevised deal over the line.Divided we stand So a group of 25 Labour MPs from Leave areas has written to Mr Corbyn urging him to "compromise" in talks with Mrs May.The group includes the shadow minister Gloria De Piero, and former shadow minister Melanie Onn, who resigned because she voted against the referendum option rather than abstain on an indicative vote.More familiar supporters of Mrs May's current deal - such as Caroline Flint and Sir Kevin Barron - have added their names too - as has Lisa Nandy, the former frontbencher who has so far held out against the prime minister's deal, but who could be persuaded if it were combined with a customs union.The signatories say: "Our policy seeks a deal that protects jobs and rights at work.It does not require a confirmatory ballot on any deal that meets those conditions."The political hook But sources close to the Labour leader think the fuss over a referendum is over-blown, as government and opposition are unlikely to agree a joint motion on Brexit in any case.It's far more likely there will be a series of votes on a range of options - including a referendum - next week.Peter Kyle, who drafted a motion on the option of a referendum during the phase of indicative votes, is hopeful of success.His formulation garnered more votes - though not a majority - from MPs than any other option.But some close to the Labour leadership believe it will, once again, be rejected.That outcome would get both the prime minister and the opposition leader off a potentially painful political hook.But it doesn't bring a Brexit deal any closer.
Led by Donkeys and Brexit Express: Why campaigners are using the humble billboard:::::Image copyright Brexit Express Image caption Campaign groups, including those for Brexit, are among those hiring out billboards In a world which is increasingly moving online, the old-fashioned billboard seems to be having a moment.Brexit campaigners on both sides have hired billboards across the UK, while activists for other causes - from promoting the Saudi crown prince to veganism - have got in on the act.This is despite internet advertising booming: in 2017, the 11.5bn online market overtook all other forms, a report for the government found.So why are billboards still popular?The Brexit campaigners Led By Donkeys is the name of a group of four friends who describe themselves as an anti-Brexit guerrilla protest group.They came up with their idea last December, while discussing Brexit in a pub.They were talking about how tweets (in particular one of David Cameron's) can get lost amid the noise of the internet.They wondered: "Can we make sure it wasn't forgotten about?"Four months on, the group has hired more than 240 billboards across the UK, having raised over 340,000.The posters feature old tweets or quotes from politicians who have been involved in the Brexit process.Image copyright Led By Donkeys Image caption The first billboard went up next to the A10 in London Why choose billboards?Co-founder Adam - not his real name - believes endless scrolling through digital content has led to a "problem in holding politicians to account - they get away with saying things"."Very quickly these quotes disappear into the digital graveyard.We have put these tweets back into the public space.It gives people the opportunity to re-read them in the reality about what's unfolding.""In an information-rich, perhaps information-overloaded age, putting these words up without... commentary gives people an opportunity to appraise them on their own terms."That's the space in which people can begin to change their own minds."Image copyright Led By Donkeys Image caption A banner in Dover shows a quote during a 2011 debate on the UK's relationship with the EU There's another point, he added - not everyone who is politically engaged is on social media."Taking [the words] off the digital, makes them more tangible.That move from digital into physical thing, the responsibility for the words becomes more acute."On the other side of the debate is Brexit Express, a pro-Leave group formed in the run up to the 2016 EU referendum.Image copyright Brexit Exoress Image caption Brexit Express says the group is not party political Its current campaign started a month ago, though not in response to Led By Donkeys, said Patrick Barrow.It has more than 100 ads up across the UK at the moment."Its simple reasoning is to really ensure MPs are reminded of public opinion," he said.The idea the internet is king is true "up to a point [but] at some point most people are on the roads, on the street, in a Tube station."Image copyright Brexit Express Image caption The response on Twitter has been "positive", the group said, although there have been some attempts to take the posters down In that regard, physical posters can complement online campaigns, he said.Billboard ads are "more impactful" and "play much more to the tried and tested techniques of commercial and political slogans".He cites iconic slogans such as "Beanz meanz Heinz", adding: "These are things that people store in their heads."The 2017 film Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, about a grieving mother who seeks justice for her murdered daughter by hiring billboards, sparked similar campaigns.Last year in London, Grenfell Tower campaigners drove banners in the same colours and font of those in the film through the capital.Image copyright Jeff Moore/Justice4Grenfell Image caption The billboard campaign demanded justice for the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Other stunts - including one by NHS campaigners in Bristol - have also taken inspiration from the film.And separately, in March last year, huge signs promoted the Saudi crown prince ahead of his visit to London.Yvette Williams, from the Justice 4 Grenfell group which was behind their billboard effort, said organisers were looking for new ideas to draw attention - and, in particular, catch the eye of young people.The three signs achieved their aim."Stormzy picked it up," she said, referring to the south London grime star who, during his Brits performance a week later, criticised Theresa May over the government's response to Grenfell.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption "Billboards still work," said Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri actress Frances McDormand, who said she enjoyed seeing them move "off the screen and onto the street" Last summer, vegan Tony Galuidi, from Middlesbrough, spent 2,400 on four billboards near the town's traffic hotspots, to urge people to consider what they eat.For Mr Galuidi, the publicity was much of the attraction.Image copyright Tony Galuidi Image caption Mr Galuidi said "the novelty" of buying a billboard is a "different way to get the message across" "I was wanting the press to see all of it.As a consequence, I have been on TV twice, written in the i newspaper and on the radio.It's been brilliant for promoting the message."The money was "absolutely" worth it, he said.The billboard businesses According to Outsmart, the trade body for the billboard industry, the market for "out of home advertising" grew by 5.7% last year to be worth 1,209m.However, data suggests this growth is down to the boom in digital billboards.Traditional ad hoardings have seen a decline in revenue.The market for billboards is showing "continued steady growth" said Martin Corke, of Clear Channel UK - part of one of the world's largest outdoor advertising firms.Globally, it sells space on hundreds of thousands of billboards.With 12,000 in the UK, national reach - "they are kind of everywhere" - is a big draw.But also, they are a "safe place"."Brands don't have to worry about appearing next to inappropriate content.You are in the public domain, it's a very open environment."By contrast, online ads risk appearing next to offensive content.An obvious perk for advertisers is that "the public can't miss them".Another is they represent good value, with rent for a two-week billboard starting from hundreds of pounds.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption "We know through research that brands that are in the public domain are more trusted," Mr Corke said Meanwhile, Simon Boon, director of billboard advertising company Airoutdoor - one of several which sold space to the group Led By Donkeys - said traditional billboard advertising "works beautifully" with online."Although we spend a lot of time on a device, we are still driving our cars, walking to work."Mr Boon said the company is apolitical, but believes in freedom of speech."We said we will do this as long as there's no politics and swearing," he said."No obscenities, nothing which can be any way illegal or immoral.As long as it meets that criteria, we are happy to put it up."The Advertising Standards Authority said billboard ads must not be misleading, harmful or offensive.However, it said it does not regulate political ads, so when campaign groups buy billboard space it is likely to be considered political and falls out of its remit.
Brexit talks: What are the likely sticking points?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Cross-party talks between the Conservatives and Labour, aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock, are continuing.Theresa May has said she wants to negotiate a "joint plan" with Jeremy Corbyn.If that is agreed, it would then be put to MPs in the hope that a Brexit deal could finally be voted through Parliament.Both leaders have agreed a "programme of work" for their negotiating teams to work on.So, what are the main differences likely to be when it comes to Brexit and where might possible compromise be found?Customs union Theresa May has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU - it's one of her so-called red lines.As a member of the European Union, the UK is part of the EU customs union.Its members have an agreement not to carry out checks or put tariffs (extra payments) on goods that move around the area.This can be particularly advantageous for businesses whose goods cross multiple EU borders.But critics of the system say it has several drawbacks.For one, members of the customs union cannot negotiate their own trade deals, on goods, with other countries - such as the United States.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.As recently as 25 March, the prime minister rejected the idea of a customs union, saying it "does not deliver on [an] independent trade policy".Labour says it wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, after Brexit.But it also says it wants the UK to "have a say" when the EU strikes future trade deals.The level of UK involvement would depend on what Labour means by "have a say" but EU law currently prevents a non-EU member from influencing or vetoing its trade negotiations.But Labour says its policy cannot be ruled out until it has had a chance to negotiate this with the EU.Single market Membership of the single market is another area where there are differences.The EU single market requires members to follow the same regulations and standards to keep trade flowing freely.It is based on four freedoms: goods, services, money and people (this last one allows EU citizens to live and work in the UK, and vice versa).When Theresa May first set out her Brexit negotiating objectives, she said failing to leave the single market "would to all intents and purposes mean not leaving the EU at all".That's because the UK would have to continue to pay into the EU budget, follow all the rules, and continue to allow freedom of movement.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.Labour's policy, on the other hand, is to have "close alignment with the single market".But the EU has previously said the UK cannot cherry-pick only the parts of the single market it likes.So, it's unclear what the EU would accept as "close alignment", which Labour is calling for.Immigration Theresa May has always been firm that Brexit must mean the end to freedom of movement.In her 2017 election manifesto, she set out plans for an immigration system designed to "reduce and control" the number of people coming to the UK from the EU - and she hasn't wavered from this pledge.Like the Conservatives, Labour also pledged at the 2017 election to end freedom of movement.So, on the surface, this looks like something on which the two party leaders could agree.But in January, when it came to voting on the Immigration Bill, which would put an end to freedom of movement, Labour encouraged its MPs to vote against it.A big unknown is whether Labour's policy of "close alignment" with the single market might restrict the UK's ability to set its own immigration policy.Its Brexit Secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, previously told BBC News the party would be willing to accept some EU workers but with restrictions."If somebody is coming to do a job and it needs to be done and it has been advertised locally beforehand with nobody able to do it, then most people would say, 'I accept that,'" he said.A Labour spokesperson said: "We support fair rules and the reasonable management of migration."Workers' rights Theresa May has said she's made it clear in the political declaration - the part of her deal agreed with the EU concerning the future relationship - that the UK agrees to not going backwards in terms of workers' rights.But she has not guaranteed that when the EU introduces a new right or protection for workers, the UK will also adopt it.In Prime Minister's Questions last week, though, Jeremy Corbyn said he wanted to use EU standards, including any introduced in the future, as a minimum for the UK to improve on.He accused the prime minister's deal of involving a "race to the bottom" on workers' rights - something he said Labour's proposals would prevent.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: Can you have frictionless trade in a customs union?:::::Sir Oliver Letwin told BBC News on Wednesday morning: "I think it should be possible to forge an arrangement in which we do have frictionless trade in a customs union, for the time being at least."At the moment, the UK has frictionless trade with other European Union (EU) countries because the EU is both a single market and a customs union.The customs union means that once goods have cleared customs in one country and the commonly agreed tariffs (charges on imports) have been paid, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed.The single-market part means that there is free movement of goods, services, capital and people and all the members follow the same rules, regulations and standards.Having just one or the other does not give you frictionless trade.Image copyright AFP Turkey, for example, has a customs union with the EU, covering most manufactured goods, but is not part of the single market.The border between Turkey and Bulgaria is far from frictionless.Documentation is needed to cross the border, including things such as export licences, invoices and transport permits.A report prepared for the European Commission in 2014 suggested a waiting time of about three hours for lorries travelling from Turkey to Bulgaria - but, anecdotally, lorry drivers say they sometimes have to wait for more than 24 hours, in queues several kilometres long.Norway is part of the single market but not part of the EU or its customs union.Image copyright Getty Images That means that goods exported from Norway into the EU must meet rules of origin requirements, to demonstrate that they do not contain more than the maximum permitted level of parts and components from elsewhere.Norway's border with Sweden, for example, is one of the most frictionless in the world between two countries that do not have a customs union - but it still takes about 20 minutes on average for a lorry to pass through its main border crossing, at Svinesund.Sir Oliver told BBC Reality Check: "I am of course assuming that the Chequers arrangement for a single market in goods is also part of the deal, as both Mr Corbyn and Mrs May will wish it to be."While Theresa May's Chequers agreement did indeed suggest a common rulebook on goods, the political declaration that sets out the starting point for the negotiations on a future relationship says that trade in goods should be "as close as possible", which is not the same as being frictionless.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Has Theresa May's Brexit strategy left the DUP in the lurch?:::::Image copyright Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA Image caption The DUP and Conservatives entered a confidence-and-supply arrangement after the 2017 General Election Has the shift in Theresa May's Brexit strategy left the DUP in the lurch?It certainly looks that way.Up to now, the prime minister had been trying to win the votes of the 10 DUP MPs, by seeking changes to her deal.It seems she has now decided that path has reached a dead end.Mrs May has side-stepped her confidence-and-supply partners, and turned to the official opposition benches to reach consensus.Yet again, the DUP has criticised her overall handling of the negotiations, this time as "lamentable".It's warned that allowing Jeremy Corbyn to "sub-contract" the future of Brexit is unlikely to end well.But Number 10 has likely listened to the repeated opposition coming from DUP quarters and figured that it's time to pursue a more flexible route.As recently as Sunday, Sammy Wilson said the DUP would vote against the deal "1,000 times", if it stayed the same.Well, there's no re-negotiation on the backstop forthcoming from the EU.Theresa May has accepted that avenue isn't open to her - despite the DUP's repeated calls for it.It's not clear if talks with Labour will lead to much, or if the EU will be willing to grant another extension, without enforcing certain conditions like the UK taking part in next month's European elections.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jeremy Corbyn: "I recognise that she has made a move...I recognise my responsibility" If something can emerge from the May-Corbyn talks, the government has said that won't change the withdrawal agreement - but rather shape the UK's future relationship with the EU (the political declaration).That means getting Labour to accept the backstop, which will prove a big task unless the prime minister is willing to show flexibility on some of Labour's demands.Other parties in Northern Ireland, who are pro-remain and support the backstop, will hope Theresa May has now left behind the Brexiteer wing of her party and the DUP.The repeated criticism being that the DUP does not represent the majority in Northern Ireland who voted remain in 2016's referendum.The DUP, meanwhile, has not indicated that it is preparing to withdraw its support for the government.It's always said it would only take drastic action, if the government got the withdrawal agreement (including the backstop) through Parliament.That's still a big if: Mrs May's change of direction, however, shows she is determined - one way or another - to get the votes she needs from somewhere, to avoid no deal.Pulling the plug The DUP could yet pull the plug - but given the influence it wields at Westminster, that's not a decision it will take easily.On Tuesday night, Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the government still wanted to secure the support of the DUP - but it's hard to see how this could happen, when it is now pursuing options the DUP is so against.Image copyright PAcemaker Image caption Boris Johnson was a guest speaker at the DUP party conference in 2018 Labour's call for a permanent customs union with the EU would breach the version of Brexit that the DUP wants, and also would not eliminate the potential for border checks in Ireland.For its part, the DUP says it will judge all outcomes in the coming days against its "clear unionist principles".However much resistance it puts up, for now Mrs May is taking her chances with Labour - and leaving her Northern Ireland allies in the margins.
Brexit deadlock: The Commons in numbers:::::The House of Commons continues to struggle to break the Brexit deadlock.MPs have rejected the UK's withdrawal agreement with the EU three times and have twice voted down all the alternative options put forward.An explanation for this stalemate can be found not only in MPs' deeply-held and divergent views on Europe but also in the fluid political make-up of the House of Commons.What was the situation in 2017?Image copyright PA Image caption The DUP have supported the Conservatives since 2017 but will their agreement survive Brexit?No political party won a majority at the 2017 election, which resulted in a Hung Parliament.After the poll, the Conservatives agreed a parliamentary pact - officially known as a confidence and supply agreement - with the Democratic Unionists.This arrangement gave Theresa May's government an overall majority of six - in other words, the Tories and DUP had six more MPs elected than all the other parties combined.But in reality it had what is called a working majority of 13.That's because Sinn Fein - which currently has seven MPs - historically does not take up its seats.Excluding Commons Speaker John Bercow and his non-voting deputies, Tory Eleanor Laing and Labour's Lindsay Hoyle and Dame Rosie Winterton, Theresa May has typically needed to get the backing of 320 MPs to get a majority in Commons votes.For the first year or so, the government got its legislation through Parliament quite comfortably but as Mrs May has found to her cost, things have become much more problematic in recent months.What's changed?Image copyright AFP Image caption Anna Soubry (centre) and Sarah Wollaston (right) are among those to have left the Conservatives The government's already slim working majority - the smallest of any new government since the 1970s - has been further whittled down this year.In January, three Conservative members of Parliament - Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry - quit the party to join the Independent Group of MPs.Then on Monday, former minister Nick Boles resigned the Conservative whip over Brexit and said he would be sitting as an Independent Progressive Conservative.What's the current state of play?Image copyright AFP Image caption Labour has suffered its own casualties - losing more than a dozen MPs As it stands, Theresa May currently has a working majority of six.This will fall to five if Labour wins the Newport West by-election on Thursday.The seat has been vacant since the death of Paul Flynn in February.Labour has held the seat since 1987 and Mr Flynn re-gained it with a majority of 5,658 two years ago.The Conservatives are still the largest party by far in the House of Commons, with 312 MPs.Their direct numerical lead over Labour, the second largest party, has actually grown since 2017.After the last election, it stood at 55 seats.Now it is 68.That's because Labour, which currently has 243 MPs, has suffered a slew of defections of their own.Eight of their MPs left to join the Independent Group while another five - Ivan Lewis, John Woodcock, Jared O'Mara, Frank Field and Ian Austin - have quit the party for a variety of reasons and are now sitting as independents.Fiona Onasanya was expelled after being jailed for perverting the course of justice while Kelvin Hopkins and Chris Williamson are currently suspended pending internal inquiries into their conduct.What does this mean for Brexit?With the DUP opposed to her agreement and Tory MPs increasingly prepared to defy the whip, Theresa May has no real majority to speak of for her Brexit policy.As well as the three defeats on the withdrawal agreement, the government has been left red-faced on numerous other occasions, even losing control of the House during the indicative votes process.When it has won key votes, it has often only done so by the skin of its teeth.The government is opposed by a broad coalition of Labour, SNP, Lib Dem, Plaid Cymru and Green MPs who are pushing for a different kind of exit, or who want to remain in the EU.While some of the newly-independent MPs, including ex-Liberal Democrat Stephen Lloyd, have sided with Mrs May over Brexit, most have not while the Independent Group has voted as a bloc against the PM.What does this mean for a confidence vote?Jeremy Corbyn tabled a no-confidence motion in the government in January, shortly after its first defeat on Theresa May's Brexit deal.Every single Conservative MP at the time supported the government, as did the Democratic Unionists, as the government survived by a margin of 325 to 306 votes.But the result could be a lot closer if the Labour leader chooses to repeat the exercise again.Not only do the Conservatives have fewer MPs but leading Tory Brexiteers have warned the PM their support cannot be taken for granted if they think the future of Brexit is under threat.And the DUP have said they will use all means to oppose the withdrawal agreement in its current form.
Brexit delay: How can Article 50 be extended?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May has said she will ask the European Union for a further delay to Brexit to break the political deadlock at Westminster.As things stand, the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April.The prime minister said a further extension to Article 50 was needed in order to leave the EU "in a timely and orderly way".She has offered to sit down with the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to agree a plan.She said it would have to include the current withdrawal agreement (negotiated between the UK and EU) and would focus on the future relationship with the EU.The aim would be to put it to MPs for approval and then take it to Brussels next week.If Mrs May and Mr Corbyn couldn't agree on a single plan then a range of options could be put to MPs instead.Article 50 This further delay requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty which sets out what happens when a country decides that it wants to leave the EU.It allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on a divorce - finalising a withdrawal agreement and drawing up the broad outlines of a future relationship.Theresa May and her fellow EU leaders agreed both of those but their deal has been rejected - in successive votes - in the House of Commons.The UK was due to leave on 29 March (two years after Article 50 was triggered) but, because no agreement could be reached at Westminster, the prime minister asked the EU for a delay to avoid the UK leaving without a deal.Now, she says she needs more time - so how does she go about getting it?The UK makes a request The UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it needs the agreement of all 27 other EU countries (EU27).That's what happened when the original 29 March deadline was extended.On that occasion, the request was made in a letter from Theresa May to the European Council, on 20 March.The EU agreed to delay the UK's departure although not the UK's suggested date, of 30 June.Instead, it offered two alternative dates: until 22 May, if MPs voted through the government's withdrawal agreement (by 29 March).They didn't.until 12 April, if they rejected it.Now, Theresa May has said she wants a further extension that is "as short as possible".She said the government would want a deal to be passed before 22 May to avoid the prospect of the UK having to take part in European elections.The UK will need to submit its request to EU27 leaders ahead of an emergency summit on 10 April.The EU's decision But the EU is not obliged to say yes to the UK.One big issue is the European elections which are due to start on 23 May.The EU has said the UK cannot stay beyond 22 May if it doesn't take part in the polls.The European Parliament's legal service had argued that an extension to the end of June would be fine because the new parliament would not have held its first session by then.But EU leaders have sided with a stricter legal interpretation put forward by the European Commission, which argued that allowing the UK to stay in the EU without taking part in European elections was far too much of a risk.A longer extension?The EU could insist on a longer extension.But Theresa May has been firm in saying that she doesn't want one because she "shares the frustration" that many people feel about the Brexit process.If the EU decided to offer the UK a delay of between nine and 12 months, or even longer, there could be a get-out clause: an understanding that the UK could leave the EU earlier than the specified date if the government managed to get an exit deal passed in Parliament.A long extension could also buy time for either an early UK general election or even another Brexit referendum.For now, the government says it doesn't want either of those.Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator has said a long extension carried "significant risks for the EU" and that a "strong justification would be needed" before the EU would agree.Revoking Article 50 It's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be withdrawn or revoked.The UK can do that without consulting anyone else.It would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now.But, again, Theresa May has said she does not intend to do that.The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be "unequivocal and unconditional", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter

What does a no-deal Brexit actually mean?:::::Image copyright REX/Shutterstock Image caption Not now, mate What does the phrase "no deal" mean to you?Depending on whether your answer is "an anonymous phone call offering me money" or "one of the options MPs are being asked to consider to determine how the UK leaves the EU" will probably show how devoted you are to Brexit.Similar to any big game show (we're talking politics now, sorry Deal or No Deal fans), Brexit has had its fair share of twists and turns and dramatic moments since the referendum vote in June 2016.Whether it's the "Nick, don't go!"EastEnders-style moment... Or Theresa May's car door being an analogy for the whole process... Or Brexit making a celebrity out of the grown man that has to shout "order" at MPs in a very dramatic way...It's been FULL.OF.BANTS.Well stitch up your sides and buckle up because there's another Brexit staple that's popping up more and more now (which you might want to add to your Brexit vocabulary): No-deal Brexit.What does it mean?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption No deal is becoming "more likely" according to the EU's chief negotiator No deal means the UK leaving the European Union and cutting ties immediately, with no agreement at all in place.The EU has previously said a no-deal Brexit would mean border checks would have to be brought in - which would affect things like exports and travel between the UK and EU.Things like how the UK trades with the EU and the rights of UK citizens living in the EU and visa-versa would also be up in the air.The government says it's made initial plans for a no-deal Brexit and has told businesses to do the same.Image copyright UK PARLIAMENTARY RECORDING UNIT Image caption Heads up, this is what Theresa May means if she ever invites you to a lock-in The UK was due to leave the UK on 29 March but so-called Brexit day sailed by after politicians repeatedly voted against the proposal Theresa May hammered out with the EU (aka the withdrawal deal).The EU has given the UK until 12 April to see if Parliament can agree on what should happen next - with the general understanding that yet another extension would only be on the table if the UK knows what it wants to do.At the moment, that's not happening.MPs have been voting on various other options but none have been agreed.On Tuesday 2 April, Theresa May emerged from a mammoth Brexit-escape-room-type-nightmare round of talks to say she wants a short extension to the deadline - no later than 22 May.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Thankfully, for everyone involved, this guy has nothing to do with this type of deadlock But, if things carry on until 12 April without MPs agreeing another option - as it stands - the UK would leave the EU with no deal.And if (yes, another if) that happens the UK would have to follow rules set out by the World Trade Organization (WTO).It would mean UK exports would be put under the same checks and tariffs that the EU puts on other non-EU countries which also follow these rules.Some Brexiteers support a no-deal Brexit and say it would mean the UK would be fully independent, would be able make trade deals around the world and wouldn't have to pay the divorce bill - estimated to be 39bn.But no-deal critics say it could cause chaos at the borders, push up food prices and damage businesses and the economy.With Brexit Day 2.0 still days away, there's still time for Theresa May to ask MPs to vote on her deal for a fourth time, an emergency summit of EU leaders to consider another Brexit extension to be held, and a load more no-deal memes to spread around WhatsApp.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.
Soft Brexit: What are the options?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Brexit isn't a moment or a single day.It's a long-term process.And that begs the question: where is the UK likely to end up?When people talk about a "soft Brexit" they are usually referring to the kind of economic relationship the UK will have with the EU in the future.And most of the debate revolves around two things: membership of a customs union and membership of the EU single market.Customs union Being in a customs union means there are no tariffs (or import taxes) on goods traded between two countries or trade blocs, and no other customs infrastructure.Once goods arriving from other countries have crossed the external border of a customs union, they can then move around freely without any further customs checks or payments.For companies that operate in European markets that is a huge benefit.It helps protect their complex supply chains, which often see parts cross borders several times during the manufacturing process.But the removal of internal tariffs also means members of a customs union have to apply the same external tariff to goods arriving from the rest of the world.And, after Brexit, that would limit the UK's ability to pursue a fully independent trade policy, breaking one of Theresa May's red lines.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.The UK wouldn't be able to sign separate trade agreements on goods, but it would still be able to do deals in the service sector (there are no tariffs on services).The other thing worth remembering about a customs union proposal is that - on its own - it wouldn't meet the test of avoiding a hard border in Ireland "under all circumstances".It would help, but there are other checks that need to take place at borders that have nothing to do with customs.So a customs union alone also wouldn't guarantee that trade between Dover and Calais, an economic lifeline for the UK, would be as open as it is now.Single market This is the other main building block for the UK's current economic life inside the EU.Being in the EU single market means all the rules that govern the economy are the same.That can be anything from regulations on chemicals or pharmaceuticals, to the rules on food safety and animal welfare.Staying in the single market would mean all those rules stay the same - and the UK would have to continue to respect the EU's four freedoms.That's the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.So it would be good news for the service sector, which makes up about three-quarters of the UK economy.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.But the reddest of the prime minister's red lines is probably her determination to end the free movement of people from the EU.Staying in the single market (but outside the EU) would mean that isn't possible.There are circumstances in which you can limit free movement if there is a sudden surge of arrivals, but it's fairly limited and not automatic.Common Market 2.0 Some MPs want to combine single market membership with some sort of customs arrangement that would be a customs union in all but name.This is the proposal known as Common Market 2.0 and is probably the softest form of Brexit being debated.It would resolve problems at the Irish border.One of the big differences from the UK's current status is that it would no longer have to be part of the EU's common fishing and agriculture policies.But critics argue that if you're staying in the single market and in a close customs partnership, there's not much point in leaving the EU in the first place.None of the above There are of course plenty of Conservative MPs who would prefer to leave with no deal than any of the options outlined above.Initially, trading would be done on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms - which would mean some goods would be subject to tariffs.The UK would also lose all the trade deals it is currently part of as an EU member - although the government is currently trying to replicate these "as far as possible".In addition to tariffs, there would be extra checks at the external border of the single market - which could lead to bottlenecks at some ports (such as Dover).But even if you leave with no deal, you still need to negotiate a future relationship.No-one is advocating cutting trade links with the EU altogether.Most no-deal Conservatives want to end up in a free trade agreement with the EU, similar to the one negotiated in the last few years between the EU and Canada.They argue that because the UK will be a much more important trading partner for the EU, it can get a much better deal than Canada.That would get rid of most tariffs on goods, but it wouldn't deal with other aspects of customs such as rules of origin, which mean companies have to prove where all the parts in their products have come from.That can be a time-consuming and expensive business.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some Brexiters favour a future relationship based on the EU-Canada free trade deal A free trade agreement is a much looser economic partnership than membership of the single market and the customs union, or of any combination of the two.It would allow the UK to regain more sovereignty over the economic decisions it has to make, but it would make trading with the EU, its largest single partner, more difficult.Nearly three years after the Brexit referendum, these are the choices that MPs are still struggling with.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions
Brexit: Your simple guide to the UK leaving the EU:::::Image copyright AFP Feeling a little lost on Brexit?Never really got your head around it in the first place?Let us walk you through it.What is Brexit?Brexit is short for "British exit" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU).What is the EU?The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries which trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work (click here if you want to see the full list).The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973.Why is the UK leaving?A public vote - called a referendum - was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.The Leave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m - but the exit didn't happen straight away.It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been extended twice (we will explain in more detail below).What has happened so far?The 2016 vote was just the start.Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries.The discussions have been mainly over the "divorce" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards.This deal is known as the Withdrawal Agreement.Image copyright AFP What does the Withdrawal Agreement say?The Withdrawal Agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about 39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU, and equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) A length of time, called the transition period, has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust.That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020.Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term.This is the political declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks.The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs.Have MPs backed the Withdrawal Agreement?Well, no.They have voted against it three times.On 15 January they rejected the deal by 432 votes to 202 - a record defeat.Then on 12 March, after Theresa May had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances, they rejected it again.And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU - MPs rejected it for a third time (this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration).The UK was meant to leave on 29 March - why didn't it?As MPs did not approve Theresa May's withdrawal deal in a vote on 12 March, the prime minister was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit.They agreed to postpone it until 22 May, if MPs approved her deal in a new vote.As they didn't (on 29 March), the UK missed that deadline and faced leaving on 12 April instead.But Mrs May has now gone back to the EU to ask for another extension - which the EU has agreed to.The new deadline is 31 October.However, the UK can leave before then if the prime minister can somehow get her deal approved by Parliament.So what happens now?The government will continue talks with Labour to try to come up with a solution.If the two sides do not come to an agreement, Theresa May has said she will put a number of options to MPs to work out what to do next.Why do people oppose the deal?Image copyright Getty Images There are a broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU.One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border.Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something called the backstop - a sort of safety net - was included in the deal.What is the backstop?The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations.It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products.The prime minister insists that if all goes as planned it will never be used.But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good.Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still, in it.And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK.On 11 March, Mrs May and the EU released a statement, giving added legal reassurances that the backstop plan, if it ever needed to be used, would only be temporary.Mrs May hoped the statement would persuade her MPs to vote for her deal, but it was still rejected.So could Brexit actually not happen at all?It is written into law that the UK will be leaving.The European Court of Justice has said the UK could cancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations, but politically, that's not likely to happen.What happens if the UK leaves without a deal?"No deal" means the UK would have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement.That would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves, and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately (more on that here).The government says it is preparing for this potential situation.It expects some food prices could rise and checks at customs could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here).It has published a series of guides - which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies.Here is a list of 10 ways you could be affected by a no-deal Brexit.
Brexit: What is Common Market 2.0?:::::Image copyright Getty Images A group of Labour and Conservative MPs is promoting what they call Common Market 2.0 as an alternative model for the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit.You may have also heard it referred to as Norway Plus.The MPs promoting it say it would go back to the sort of economic relationship the UK had with the European Economic Community in the 1970s and 80s, without having to be involved with closer political union or the direct involvement of the European Court of Justice.They also say it could be agreed with the EU quickly and that there could be a majority for it in the House of Commons.Critics point out that it would still involve freedom of movement, making significant contributions to the EU Budget and following EU regulations without membership of the bodies that create them.It crosses several of Theresa May's red lines.How would it work?The European Economic Area (EEA) includes all 28 EU countries and three nations that are not members of the EU: Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, which are part of the Single Market but not the EU or its Customs Union.They are members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), along with Switzerland, which is not part of the EEA, having single market membership as a result of a complicated set of trade deals with the EU.They make substantial contributions to the EU budget, and have to follow many EU rules and laws.EFTA members are not part of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) or the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), so they can set their own policies in those areas.They are also exempt from EU rules on justice and home affairs.What about the Customs Union?EFTA members are not members of the EU Customs Union, which means they can sign their own trade deals with other countries, but they do not benefit from EU trade deals with other countries.There have to be some customs checks on goods travelling between EFTA countries and EU countries.Norway's border with Sweden, for example, is one of the most frictionless in the world between two countries that do not have a customs union, but it still takes about 20 minutes on average for a lorry to pass through its main border crossing at Svinesund.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Svinesund Bridge is a border crossing between Sweden and Norway This is a problem for the Common Market 2.0 plan because in order to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, its supporters are proposing that there should be a customs arrangement that basically mirrors the Customs Union.It is the extra customs arrangement that makes the proposed solution a "Norway plus" deal.But having that sort of customs arrangement would be against EFTA's current rules.How much would it cost?As an EFTA member, the UK would continue to make contributions to the EU Budget.They would be calculated based on which EU programmes the UK wished to continue to be involved with.It is likely that the bill would be considerably lower than it is as an EU member.It's not clear exactly how much lower it would be, with estimates ranging between two thirds and 88% of the current level, which is about 9bn a year on average.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.What about having no say in the rules?When the EU adopts a measure that is relevant to the single market, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have to bring it into their domestic laws.The three countries do not get seats in the European Parliament, membership of the European Council or the right to appoint a commissioner, but they do have some influence over legislation.At the early stages they sit on committees at the European Commission, and they are entitled to submit comments on upcoming legislation.At a later stage, they can challenge a new law relating to the single market via the EEA Joint Committee, which includes representatives of the EU as well as the three countries.Through that body, they may secure exemptions from new laws and regulations.Could freedom of movement be restricted?EFTA members have to follow the four freedoms of the single market - freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and people.That means people from across the EU are free to live and work in EFTA countries, and people from EFTA countries can live and work across the EU.But the MPs promoting Common Market 2.0 have suggested that EFTA rules could allow freedom of movement to be restricted in exceptional circumstances."We would have critical new powers that we would unilaterally be able to bring in if we needed to, if a new country joined the EU, for example," Labour MP Lucy Powell told BBC News.But imposing restrictions on migrants from new EU member states is not a new power.All the existing EU states apart from the UK and Ireland temporarily imposed restrictions on the right to work for citizens of the eight countries that joined the bloc in 2004: the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.The UK did the same to Romania and Bulgaria in 2007.Image copyright Getty Images Ms Powell's claim is based on Article 112-114 of the EEA Agreement, which says countries can take unilateral action if they are facing "serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties".The measures have to be taken in consultation with other EEA members, and reviewed every three months.The only EEA country that has managed to use this is Liechtenstein, which was allowed a restriction on freedom of movement based on it being a very small country, with a population that would only fill about half of Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium.There is considerable doubt that a country with the size, population and economy of the UK would be able to do the same thing.What about the European Court of Justice?Clearly, European Court of Justice (ECJ) rulings on single market matters would still be relevant to the UK, but the court would no longer have direct powers to rule on matters of European law arising in the UK.Instead, such issues would be heard by the EFTA Court, which has a judge from each of the member countries, so currently it has three judges and presumably if the UK were to join EFTA it would also get to nominate a judge.The EFTA Court tends to follow ECJ rulings closely.Also, its rulings are not legally binding on the member states, unlike the ECJ's.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Game of Thrones, hamsters and other things that didn't last as long as Brexit:::::Image copyright Getty Images/Alamy Whatever you think about Brexit - or even if you try not to think about it at all - we can probably all agree on one thing.It has gone on for a long, long time.We're more than 1,000 days on from when the UK voted to leave the European Union and it seems politicians are only just starting to enter the endgame.Maybe.The UK and the EU have now agreed on an extension to Brexit until 31 October, here are five things that don't - or didn't - last as long as Brexit.Building the Titanic Image copyright Getty Images Image caption ERROR: Metaphor not found Before it rose to international fame as the home of the backstop, Northern Ireland was legendary for many reasons.Among them, the construction of the Titanic.The mighty liner was built in Belfast - the keel was laid in 1909 and the ship launched just 26 months later - that's about 790 days.The Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in 1912.Similarly frozen and bigger than it appeared at first sight: the question of what happens to the Irish border in the future.The frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic will become the only land crossing between the UK and the EU - so there's huge controversy about what customs arrangements could be put in place.That, simply put, is the issue that's been stopping Theresa May's deal sailing through Parliament.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.Travelling to Mars Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mars yesterday Distant, lonely, red.Thirty-five million miles away from the House of Commons.Sounds idyllic, doesn't it?When Mars and Earth are closest together, it should take around 300 days to fly between them.So since the referendum in 2016, you'd have had time to get there, harvest an entire crop of potatoes like Matt Damon and bring them home to make Mars mash for your friends.And here's something that sounds like a distant planet but isn't: MV3.That stands for Meaningful Vote 3: Theresa May's planned third attempt to get MPs to back her deal.She's promised that if they do, she'll go.Not to Mars, just out of her job as prime minister.The entire plot of Game of Thrones Image copyright HBO/Sky Atlantic Image caption "He would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes" (said no-one about Brexit ever) Estimates vary, but all the events of the epic swords 'n' sorcery saga seem to take place over a period of around three or four years (around 1,100 - 1,400 days) And Brexit has packed in enough plot twists and backstabbing in the same timescale to make Lord Baelish look like a rank amateur.Allegiances have shifted, people have been double-crossed and deep-seated loyalties have been tested.Who will be sitting on the Iron Throne - and in 10 Downing Street - when the dust settles?Only one thing is certain: both battles are going to be messy.Your pet hamster Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Wait, what?The average lifespan of a hamster is around three years (around 1,100 days) So countless hamsters have lived out their entire lives knowing nothing but endless Brexit negotiations.Just think of that.Fun fact: hamsters are immigrants.They were native to Syria and Turkey before being bred domestically.They've been with us a while now though, so like EU citizens already living here they should be fine to stay after Brexit.Constructing the Eiffel Tower Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Who doesn't love Brexit in the springtime?How long does it take to build a proud, majestic symbol of national identity?Well, if you're French, around two years (a little more than 700 days).The Eiffel Tower was erected between 1887 and 1889.The tower was supposed to be dismantled after 20 years, but of course that never happened.Because, as Theresa May has discovered, plans can change.Especially where Europe is concerned.Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitterand YouTube.Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 every weekday on BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra - if you miss us you can listen back here.
Brexit: What deal did MPs reject?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The withdrawal agreement is 585 pages long, while the political declaration is just 26 pages MPs have rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal for a third time.The government lost by 344 votes to 286, a majority of 58.But on this occasion there was a key difference: MPs only voted on the withdrawal agreement and not the political declaration.Previously, both of these were voted on and rejected.So, what are they?Withdrawal agreement This is the deal the UK government negotiated with the European Union, over 18 months, and it sets out the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.First published in November, it is almost 600 pages long and some of the key areas it covers are: The transition Under the withdrawal agreement, the UK would enter into a 21-month transition period with the EU after Brexit.During this time the UK would continue to follow EU rules and remain in the single market and customs union to allow frictionless trade to continue.The UK would also lose membership of EU institutions.The transition period could be extended, but only for a period of one or two years.Money This is known as "the divorce bill" - the amount of money the UK would need to pay the EU to settle its obligations.Although no figure appears in the document, it is expected that the UK would pay at least 39bn over a number of years.The Irish backstop The most controversial part of the withdrawal agreement is the Irish backstop, which has proved to be the main reason it cannot command a majority in Parliament.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics The backstop is the insurance policy designed to prevent a hard border in Ireland after Brexit.It would kick in at the end of the transition period in the event that a comprehensive trade deal, that avoids the needs for checks at the Irish border, is not reached between the UK and EU.The terms of the backstop would effectively place the UK into a temporary customs union with the EU.Critics worry that the UK could find itself trapped in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to pursue its own independent trade policy (signing trade deals with countries like the US).Citizens' rights During the transition period, UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, would retain their residency and welfare rights after Brexit.The withdrawal agreement also allows citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK, of course) to be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.Political declaration The political declaration - also published in November - is all about the future relationship between the UK and the EU, after Brexit.This document is far shorter (just 26 pages) and, unlike the withdrawal agreement, it is not legally binding.Some of the keys areas it covers are: Trade The document calls on the trading relationship to be "as close as possible" and says there would be an "ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced" economic partnership.But it does not a set out what the final outcome for UK-EU trade will look like.Customs The political declaration refers to an "ambitious customs arrangement".The concern, from some, is that this could turn into a permanent arrangement that could prevent the UK from pursuing its own independent trade policy.The government dismisses this concern, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future.Irish border Technology and other alterative arrangements would be considered in order to keep the Irish border open with no physical infrastructure (eg border posts).However, presently, there is no border which the EU shares with a non-EU country that is entirely open and frictionless.Freedom of movement The UK, according to the document, would take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK (and UK citizens to the EU) would come to an end.The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: what is the withdrawal agreement?:::::Image copyright Getty Images The draft Brexit withdrawal agreement stands at 599 pages long.It sets out how the UK leaves the European Union.Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been going through it in detail and pulls out the key points from the agreement and what they mean.Transition The transition period (which the UK government calls "implementation period") is due to last for 21 months.The UK will need to abide by all EU rules, but will lose membership of its institutions.The draft withdrawal agreement says the transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years.Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension.Chris Morris's analysis: The details of transition aren't new but they are no less awkward for that.At a time when the government wants to trumpet that it is taking back control (its slogan, not mine), it will be ceding control for 21 months and very possibly longer.There will be no UK presence in the European Parliament, at the top table of the European Commission or in the European Court of Justice.The UK will have no formal say in making or amending EU rules and regulations, but it will have to follow them to the letter.The great advantage of transition, of course, is that it buys more time for businesses and governments to prepare for a new regime, and it smoothes the path out of the EU.Transition also gives the UK continued access to EU databases on crucial issues like security while a future relationship is negotiated.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.Money The draft agreement sets out the calculations for the financial settlement (or "divorce bill") that the UK will need to pay to the EU to settle all of its obligations.While no figure appears in the document, it is expected to be at least 39bn and it will be paid over a number of years.Part of that money will be the financial contribution that the UK has to make during the transition period.In 2018/19 the UK's contribution to the EU budget is forecast to be a net 10.8bn.If the transition is extended, there will have to be additional UK payments to the EU budget, which will be agreed separately.Chris Morris's analysis: It seems a long time now since the size of the "divorce bill" was the big issue that was never going to be resolved, but the government knew that without a financial settlement, progress on other issues would be impossible.Money remains a cause of controversy, though, because many Brexit supporters hate the fact that large sums will be handed over without any cast-iron guarantee about the nature of the UK's future trade relationship with the EU.Any refusal to pay, on the other hand, would sour relations and could - in extremis - end up in court.Citizens' rights This is broadly unchanged from the initial draft of the withdrawal agreement which came out in March.UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit.Citizens who take up residency in another EU country during the transition period (including the UK of course) will be allowed to stay in that country after the transition.Anyone that stays in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence.Chris Morris's analysis: The European Parliament has promised to make citizens' rights its top priority.But while politicians on all sides are telling citizens that they want them to stay, the Brexit process has caused an enormous amount of anxiety and uncertainty.British citizens in other EU countries, for example, still don't know whether they will be able to work across borders after the transition period, because their right to reside only applies to the specific country where they live.Recognition of professional qualifications, and access to university education on the same terms they have now are also unresolved issues.Northern Ireland/the backstop If no long-term trade deal has been agreed by the end of 2020 that avoids a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and if there is no extension to the transition period, then a backstop consisting of "a single customs territory between the (European) Union and the United Kingdom" will be triggered.Northern Ireland will be in a deeper customs relationship with the EU than the rest of the UK; it will also be more closely aligned with the rules and regulations of the EU single market.As long as the backstop is in operation, the UK will be subject to "level playing field conditions", to ensure it cannot gain a competitive advantage while remaining in the same customs territory.The UK cannot leave the backstop independently, it needs to be decided together with the EU.Chris Morris's analysis: The single customs territory is basically another name for a temporary customs union and, if it were needed, it would ensure that completely frictionless trade could continue across the Irish border.But it would also prevent the UK implementing any trade deals with other countries around the world that involve removing tariffs on goods.That upsets supporters of Brexit, especially as there is no guaranteed route out of this backstop unless the EU gives its consent.The Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland was the toughest part of the draft agreement to negotiate and, now it has been published, it has triggered a series of government resignations.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Confused by Brexit jargon?Reality Check unpacks the basics.Fishing The agreement says that a separate agreement will need to be reached on access to EU fishing in UK waters.The document says: "The Union and the United Kingdom shall use their best endeavours to conclude and ratify 'an agreement' on access to waters and fishing opportunities."Chris Morris's analysis: Fishing is always a hot button issue, even though in most countries the fishing sector forms a tiny part of the economy.Fishing has been left out of plans for a single customs territory because several countries objected to the idea that UK fish produce would be allowed unimpeded access to EU markets, without any corresponding guarantee that EU boats would be granted access to UK fishing waters.It's an example of how negotiations on a temporary customs union were bound to throw up a host of complications - and a reminder of how tough negotiations on a future trade agreement are likely to be.Laws and disputes The UK will remain under European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction during the transition.A joint UK-EU committee will be set up to try to resolve any disputes on the interpretation of the withdrawal agreement.If the backstop is triggered and the UK forms a single customs territory with the EU, the ECJ will not be able to resolve disputes between the UK and EU directly.Instead, the whole dispute resolution procedure will be backed up by an arbitration panel.However, if any dispute rests on the interpretation of EU law, the arbitration panel refers the case to the ECJ for a binding decision.Chris Morris's analysis: Most of this draft agreement deals with matters of EU law, so the European Court of Justice casts a long shadow.The arbitration system for resolving disputes creates a semblance of independence and ECJ rulings will no longer have direct effect in the UK once transition is over.That is an important point of principle for the UK government, but the European Court will continue to have indirect influence over the UK for many years to come.What else is in it?Elsewhere in the agreement there are protocols on Gibraltar and the British military bases in Cyprus.There's a provision that the UK will withdraw from the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom), which relates to how nuclear material is handled.EU-approved geographical indications, protecting approved names like "Welsh Lamb" or "Parma Ham" remain.Alongside the withdrawal agreement, there's the outline of the political declaration, setting out what the future UK/EU relationship might look like.It's currently only seven pages long but it's being fleshed out in negotiations that are still continuing in the run-up to the EU's Brexit summit on 25 November.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: Can Norway say no to the EU?:::::The claim: Norway, using its "right of reservation", has refused to implement the EU's Postal Services Directive.Reality Check verdict: While Norway initially notified the EU that it might opt out of the Third Postal Services Directive, it was adopted by the new coalition government in 2014.Nick Boles is one of the cross-party group of MPs that has been promoting the idea of Common Market 2.0, otherwise known as Norway plus, as a model for the UK's future relationship with the European Union, after Brexit.It was one of the alternatives to Theresa May's Brexit plan considered as part of the indicative votes process in Parliament on Wednesday, when it was defeated by 283 votes to 188.One of the key objections to the proposal is that Norway adopts the rules and regulations of the single market without having any seats on the European Parliament, membership of the European Council or the right to appoint a commissioner.Norway, along with Iceland and Liechtenstein, is a member of the European Economic Area (EEA), but not of the EU itself.EEA members are part of the EU's single market.Asked about this in Parliament on Wednesday, Mr Boles told the House: "There is an absolutely crucial process for EEA members called the EEA joint committee."All new rules passed under single market legislation are referred to that committee and members of the EEA have a right of reservation, which means that the postal directive, for instance, has still never been implemented by Norway because they don't like it and they just say no."Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg has said she may be prepared to help if the UK decides to pursue a Norway plus model The EEA joint committee does indeed get to scrutinise new EU rules and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein have the right to opt out, but they have never done so."Although this 'safety valve' provision has never been used, Norway has considered invoking it a number of times and, legally speaking, there is no doubt that it can be used," Liv Monica Stubholt, partner at the Norwegian law firm Selmer, told Reality Check.The example Nick Boles used was the Postal Services Directive, which Norway said could be a reservation matter in 2011, but eventually accepted under a new coalition government in 2014.The directive introduced competition in postal services into areas that had previously generally been monopolies for national postal companies.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Norway was worried about how the directive could affect the viability of postal services in remote areas "While it's clear that states do have the right to opt out of new laws, the political costs for using it are considered to be potentially quite high, which is why it hasn't yet been used," Hanne Zimmer, from the Norwegian law firm Wikborg Rein, told Reality Check.While this has never been tested, the EU could impose sanctions under the EEA agreement such as suspending parts of the single market in ways that could be damaging to businesses in the country making the objections.Mr Boles told Reality Check: "I wasn't aware that Norway had ultimately accepted the postal directive but the broader point about the right of reservation still stands."In addition to the right of reservation to completely opt out, EEA members can also negotiate adaptations to new EU rules.While most of these are minor, technical points, there are a few examples of more significant changes, such as Norway's exemption from implementing EU rules on emergency exits in certain tunnels."Such examples are relatively rare, and the EU is generally reluctant to grant them except in very specific circumstances," Hanne Zimmer said.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: What John Bercow's intervention means for May's deal:::::Image copyright HoC Never afraid of stoking controversy, the Speaker has again infuriated many Tory MPs with his latest surprise pronouncement to the Commons.Just as it seemed the government was poised to try and get its Brexit deal through again, John Bercow took it upon himself to tick ministers off before they had even tried.Why?Because last week he ruled the deal could not be brought back to the Commons for a third time without "substantial" changes.Mr Bercow's intervention today suggests he doesn't think that test has yet been met.But No 10 disagrees and points to the additional backstop guarantees agreed at a summit in Strasbourg, and formally approved by the EU last week.It's clear the date of Brexit has changed too.It will be 22 May if the withdrawal agreement is passed by the Commons this week and 12 April if not - unless there is a further extension.With so little time, there is some incredulity around Parliament that the Speaker is sticking so rigidly to his ruling.The government was considering a procedural move that could have proved MPs wanted to have a vote, regardless of the parliamentary convention.But John Bercow said that wouldn't do.Hannah White from the Institute for Government said that while the Speaker is the ultimate authority on parliamentary procedure, "the government ought to be allowed to test the will of the House on whether to set aside its own rule".So what happens next?It still seems likely the government will have another crack at getting its deal through the Commons before Friday night.Tory opposition to the agreement seems to be crumbling at the same rate interest in alternative forms of Brexit is growing.Many Tory Brexit-enthusiasts who hate the withdrawal agreement are now very worried the indicative vote process might lead to a long extension and possibly no Brexit altogether.No 10 will only bring the deal back for a third vote if it thinks it could pass.That probably requires DUP backing and a guarantee some Labour MPs will vote for it too.As it stands, there isn't yet a majority for the deal, but the mood is shifting fast.It is possible the government attempts to pass the withdrawal agreement on its own - detaching the non-binding political agreement MPs are arguing over now from the terms of divorce.That may well satisfy the EU's deadline and allow MPs time to continue their wrangle over the sort of future relationship they want after Brexit.
Weary EU press say they're appalled by Brexit deadlock:::::Image copyright BBC Monitoring European newspapers say UK Prime Minister Theresa May's promise to quit if MPs back her Brexit deal - and the failure of Parliament to agree on any of the eight proposed alternatives - have plunged Britain deeper into paralysis.In Germany, Die Welt says "Mrs May plays her last card - her own job".It notes growing support for her proposed deal among MPs from her Conservative Party but says it remains doubtful that it will eventually be approved, adding: "The Brexit chaos in the British Parliament goes on."Similarly Germany's Bild speaks of the "chaos becoming even more confusing" after MPs rejected all eight alternative Brexit proposals.Der Spiegel magazine describes proceedings as "another day of chaos in Westminster".Image copyright Bild France's Le Figaro observes that Mrs May made a "Faustian pact" with Conservative MPs by offering to resign, but adds "on the other side of the Channel, Europeans are watching these developments with a feeling of weariness".Meanwhile, Le Monde's headline says: "The prospect of a no-deal increases by another notch."Image copyright Le Monde It recalls that French President Emmanuel Macron and Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel "openly evoked it as an option" at a European Council meeting earlier this month.For Polish broadsheet Rzeczpospolita, last night's Brexit wrangling was the "Final humiliation of Theresa May"."For a moment, it seemed that the never-ending Brexit saga was over.But this illusion lasted for two hours tops" it said, referring to the continuing refusal by the Northern Irish DUP party, on whose support the Conservatives rely, to back Mrs May's deal.Image copyright Rzeczpospolita In a similar vein, La Libre Belgique says the votes, "far from bringing the awaited clarity, plunged the United Kingdom into confusion even more profoundly".Looking ahead, Belgium's Le Soir points out that the UK may face a "cordon sanitaire" setting it apart from the rest of the EU in case of a lengthy exit process."The hypothesis of a long delay to the UK's departure, for example for a year, will give the British an influence in the EU that the EU27 will do their best to limit," it notes.For Stephen Collins in the Irish Times, letting the UK hold another European election would be "disastrous" as the European Parliament already faces an upsurge of populist forces."There is a serious danger that the Brexiteers who have paralysed the House of Commons and undermined the reputation of British politics will take their wrecking tactics to the European Parliament if the United Kingdom is allowed to remain in the European Union for an extended period," he says."It is theoretically possible that European elections in the UK could provide a rallying point for those who want to remain in the EU or at least desire a softer Brexit The problem is that no party apart from the Liberal Democrats is committed to remaining in the EU so the odds must be that, as last time, the elections will be a vehicle for anti-EU forces to mobilise."BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.You can follow BBC Monitoring on Twitter and Facebook.
Brexit: What are the options now?:::::MPs vote: What's next for Brexit?With MPs voting to take control of Commons business, what does this mean for government and how will it affect the Brexit process?
What do voters make of Brexit now?:::::Almost three years ago the UK voted in favour of leaving the EU.Yet the original departure date of 29 March has been delayed and the government is searching for a way forward.So, what do the majority of the UK's voters now think about Brexit?How well have talks been handled?Theresa May argues that her deal is the best way of fulfilling the instruction to leave given by voters in the EU referendum.Trouble is, voters themselves - including not least those who voted Leave - have become deeply critical of how the UK government has handled Brexit negotiations.This is seen in data from a newly published survey from NatCen Social Research, conducted between 24 January and 17 February.Two years ago, those who voted Leave were inclined to give the government the benefit of the doubt.However, as many as 80% of Leave voters now say that it has handled Brexit negotiations badly.That figure is almost as high as it is among Remain voters (85%), who had previously been more critical of the government's approach.Remarkably, Leave voters are now just as critical of the UK government's role as they are of the EU's: 79% of Leave supporters say the EU has handled Brexit badly.Will the UK get a good deal?Meanwhile, the longer negotiations have continued, the more pessimistic voters have become about how good a deal the UK will secure.Two years ago, there were almost as many who thought that the UK would obtain a good deal (33%) as thought it would find itself with a bad one (37%).However, that mood soon changed and by last summer as many as 57% reckoned the UK would emerge with a bad deal.Now that the first phase of the Brexit negotiations has been concluded - though, as yet at least, not approved by MPs - the proportion who think the UK is heading for a bad deal is, at 63%, even higher.Here too, Remain and Leave voters are now largely in agreement.This is despite Leave voters initially being much more positive.As many as 66% of Leave supporters now believe that the UK is faced with a bad deal - even more than the 64% of Remain voters who express that view.It seems that the prime minister's deal has failed to satisfy many of the very voters whose wishes the deal is intended to fulfil.Do UK voters still want to leave the EU?But does this negative reaction to the deal mean voters have changed their minds about leaving the EU in the first place?In truth, a moving average of the six most recent polls, has been indicating for some time that slightly more people now say they would vote Remain than Leave in another ballot.At present, the average level of support for the two options (after Don't Knows are excluded) is Remain 54%, Leave 46%.In part, this is because Leave voters are a little less likely to say they would vote the same way again (82%), than Remain voters are (86%).But the swing to Remain, such as it is, is also down to those who did not vote in 2016.Of this group, 43% say they would vote Remain, whereas 19% say they would back Leave.In truth, the polls are too close for opponents of Brexit to assume that a second ballot would produce a different result.But, equally, supporters of Brexit cannot say with confidence that the balance of opinion remains as it was in June 2016.More like this Do people support another referendum?So, do the UK's voters want another referendum?That depends on how they are asked.Some polls introduce the idea of another ballot as a "people's vote", or a "public vote" and do not make it clear that remaining in the EU would be an option.When put to the public in this way, the polls suggest on average that supporters of a second referendum outnumber opponents by 12 points.However, the average level of support and opposition changes when people are asked if there should be another referendum with Remain as an option on the ballot paper.Asked in this way, opponents outnumber supporters by nine points.But perhaps what is more important is that Remain voters are much keener on this idea than Leave supporters.That suggests the proposal is not yet a way out of the Brexit impasse that is backed by both sides in the Brexit debate.Remain and Leave voters may agree that they do not like Mrs May's deal, but that does not mean that they agree on what should happen instead.About this piece This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.It is partly based on research published by NatCen Social Research and the website WhatUKThinks.Sir John Curtice is professor of politics at Strathclyde University, senior fellow at NatCen Social Research and The UK in a Changing Europe.He is also chief commentator at WhatUKthinks.org.Edited by Duncan Walker Charts by David Brown
Brexit debate: Do petitions ever work?:::::More than five million people in the UK have signed a petition calling on the government to stop Brexit by revoking Article 50.It's the most popular petition to ever have been submitted on the UK Parliament's website - and historians say it is the biggest ever petition to parliament in history.But the government has ruled out cancelling Brexit, and rejected a previous petition for a second referendum.MP Andrea Leadsom, leader of the House of Commons, has dismissed the petition, saying it has far fewer signatories than the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU during the 2016 referendum.So do petitions ever achieve anything - and is there any point in signing one?"Petitions by themselves don't do anything, but they can be a very valuable tool for change," says Cristina Leston-Bandeira, a professor of politics at the University of Leeds, who specialises in petitions and public engagement.It all comes down to "how campaigners use the petition to put pressure on their representatives".Can petitions succeed?The petitions website Change.org says that, globally, one of its petitions secures a campaign victory ever hour.One of the campaigns it lists as a success is the 2015 petition to scrap the "tampon tax" - a sales tax on sanitary products - in the UK.The organiser, Laura Coryton, was a student when she started the petition - and made headlines after more than 320,000 people signed up.Image copyright Change.org Image caption Laura Coryton (centre right) started her first-ever petition in 2015 Months later, the government said it would try to change the relevant EU law so the tax could be removed.Many retailers also cut costs on sanitary products to shoulder the cost of the tax themselves.Ms Coryton says she did not expect her petition to be so popular, but believes it was helpful in allowing large numbers of people to document their desire for change."320,000 signatures is much harder to ignore than one person writing to their MP," she told the BBC.However, she's keen to stress while the petition helped attract attention, there were many more factors behind the campaign's success."So many people wrote to their MPs, started localised campaigns, or raised motions at their universities - it was definitely a combination of traditional campaigning methods and petitions at the same time."Another reason petitions can work is by raising awareness, says Bettina Siegel, a US blogger who led three petitions given "confirmed victory" status by Change.org.Ms Siegel is known for her campaign to stop the use of "pink slime" (lean beef trimmings made from fatty beef carcass off-cuts) in US school lunches, and also petitioned to block a McDonald's infomercial from local schools."In general, I think a petition can attract the attention of news media because it's a very tangible indication of public interest," she told the BBC.However, she adds: "A business is likely to be more responsive because they have a direct financial interest in pleasing their customers.I think it's more complicated when you're petitioning a government."Why do people sign petitions that are unlikely to succeed?It's fair to say that not all of the 5.6 million people behind the "Revoke Article 50" petition expect the government will suddenly agree to keep the UK in the EU.Image copyright EPA Image caption Hundreds of thousands took part in a "Put it to the People" march in London on Saturday But, people signing petitions for causes they think are unlikely to win is nothing new."A traditional historical feature of petitions is that many people will sign it without an expectation that it is necessarily something the government will turn around and agree to" right away, says Dr Richard Huzzey, a historian at Durham University leading a study into petitions.Instead, many signed petitions "out of a sense of duty and self-expression" and to "discharge their own personal sense of responsibility".They "hope it will draw attention [to the issue] and play a part in shifting the dynamic", he says.He points to a 1783 petition against slavery in the colonies - which was not abolished until 1833 - as an example of a petition that supporters would have signed without expecting any immediate change."Thinking about petitions in isolation misses the fact that historically they've been the lynchpin of broader activism and campaigns - they are very important but rarely a solution in their own right."What makes a modern petition successful?Both Ms Coryton and Ms Siegel believe that petitions work best when they are specific and asking for something "realistically achievable".For example, "ending sexism" is a great goal but too vague, whereas targeting the tampon tax addresses "a specific symptom of a sexist society", says Ms Coryton.Prof Leston-Bandeira argues that petitions don't have to dominate headlines, or attract millions of signatures, to be successful."If you have a system where petitions are integrated into policy processes, like parliamentary procedures or debate... they can really effect change."She points to the example of a petition into funding for brain tumour research, which sparked a petitions committee inquiry at a point when it only had about 14,000 signatures.Eventually it attracted 120,000 signatures, enabled the stories of many affected by brain tumours to be heard in parliament, and did lead to increased funding.Another petition, to give police dogs and horses more legal protections if they are attacked on duty, received 128,000 signatures.It was debated in parliament, and legislation, known as Finn's law, has now been approved in the House of Commons.Image copyright BCH Police Dogs Image caption German shepherd Finn was stabbed in the head and chest after pursuing a suspect in 2016 Prof Leston-Bandeira says petitions can be divided into "substantive" petitions - that tend to relate to specific policies to be changed, and "protest" petitions, which are more of an reaction or expression of dissatisfaction."Petitions on specific issues, that are non-partisan, are most likely to be successful," she says, especially if it raises an issue that lawmakers haven't thought about before.However, "protest" petitions can also be effective in less obvious ways.In 2017, more than 1.6 million people signed a petition calling for US President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK to be cancelled, and while Mr Trump still visited the UK, "it took a long time for him to come to the UK, and it was a much more low key type of visit than it would have been when it was first announced", she says.What does all this mean for the 'Revoke Article 50' petition?Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 17.4 million people - 52% - voted for Brexit in the 2016 referendum "The issue with this is it's very divisive - I wouldn't be surprised if there's a counter petition developing as we speak," says Prof Leston-Bandeira.However, she believes the petition is still "likely to apply pressure" and "shape the discourse" with the government."It will not achieve the revoking of Article 50 by itself, but it's another indicator, like the mass protest on Saturday, that MPs and the government will take into account."Even if millions more sign the petition, however, "it's not the same as people going to vote", given that all UK residents are able to sign the petition whether they are eligible to vote or not.A brief history of petitions Petitions are not a new thing - in fact there were one million petitions submitted to the UK's parliament between 1780 and 1918.Historians have suggested the first documented petitions were from slaves building pyramids in ancient Egypt, who tried to petition for better working conditions.Until this week, the biggest recorded petition to parliament was a petition against ambulance service cuts, in 1990, that attracted 4.5m signatures.Source: Dr Richard Huzzey, Durham University History department
Brexit votes: The lowdown on MPs' alternative plans:::::Image copyright Getty Images MPs are trying to forge a Brexit consensus as they debate and vote on alternatives to the government's EU withdrawal agreement.In an unprecedented show of strength by the Commons, MPs are wresting control of the parliamentary timetable from the government for a few hours to consider a range of other options and try to break the current deadlock.Commons Speaker John Bercow has chosen eight proposals, out of more than a dozen put forward by MPs, to be debated.It will then be up to MPs, when they fill in their ballot papers, to express an opinion on each of them.Any that secure the support of more than 50% of MPs could go forward to be debated again on Monday as Parliament tries to convince the government, and just as importantly the EU, that it has an alternative solution.Here's a brief rundown of proposals up for consideration and who's backing them.No-deal Brexit The general idea: It's a very straightforward motion: "That this House agrees that the UK shall leave the EU on 12 April 2019 without a deal."The key bits: It seeks to ensure that there will not be further delay to Brexit.Who's backing it?Conservative Brexiteers John Baron, Sir David Amess, Martin Vickers and Stephen Metcalfe A customs union The general idea: At least three motions were being circulated around Westminster which argue for the UK to negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU.The Speaker has selected the most straightforward one, tabled by veteran Tory MP Ken Clarke.The key bits: It does not argue for the UK to remain in the EU's current customs union.It says that any EU withdrawal agreement, and declaration on the future trading relationship, "must include, as a minimum, a commitment to negotiate a permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union with the EU".Who's backing it?The cross-party proposal has the backing of a smattering of senior Conservative and Labour MPs, including Ken Clarke, Oliver Letwin, Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper.Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button Labour's plan Image copyright PA The general idea: Aside from the customs union, the opposition's motion unarguably points in the direction of a "softer Brexit" while, the party insists, still honouring the result of the 2016 referendum.Labour argues that its proposal is negotiable with the EU - something its detractors contest.The key bits: The motion calls for "close alignment" with the single market, underpinned by shared institutions and obligations, and for the UK to be in harmony with laws on workers' rights and environmental protections.It seeks guarantees over the UK's continued participation in educational, scientific and cultural programmes and access to security and law enforcement schemes, including the European Arrest Warrant.Who backing it?It is being put forward by party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer.But it is unlikely to attract much support from other parties, particularly opposition parties who favour another referendum.Common Market 2.0 The general idea: Also known as "Norway plus", this motion takes as its starting point the Scandinavian country's relationship with the EU and seeks to build on it.It derives its name from the common market, the vernacular name for the European Economic Community (EEC) at the time the UK joined it in 1973.The key bits: The UK would reapply to join the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which it left when it signed up to the EEC.If successful, it would join what is known as the "EEA pillar" of the EFTA agreement.In essence, the UK would not leave the European Economic Area, to which it currently belongs as an EU member, and would continue to participate in the single market.It envisages a "comprehensive customs arrangement" with the EU until alternative arrangements are put in place and would maintain freedom of movement, albeit with conditions.Who's backing it?It is the brainchild of Tory MP Nick Boles, who has been championing it for nearly 18 months.It has the support of Brexiteer Tory Andrew Percy and a number of Labour MPs, including Stephen Kinnock.The Labour leadership has indicated it will order its MPs to vote for this, increasing its chances of success.EFTA/EEA The general idea: This is similar in some respects to Common Market 2.0 but with a number of important differences.While the UK would rejoin EFTA and stay within the EEA, it makes clear the UK's rights and obligations would be enforceable by the domestic courts, not the European Court of Justice.The key bits: It rejects any kind of customs union with the EU after Brexit and says the Irish backstop must be replaced with alternative arrangements to preserve the territorial integrity of the UK.Who's backing it?It has been drawn up by George Eustice, who quit as a minister last month to vote against delaying Brexit.It is largely a Tory affair but does draw support from "soft Brexiteers" like Nicky Morgan and Jeremy Lefroy and members of the Brexit Delivery Group of MPs.Confirmatory referendum The general idea: This one is pretty straightforward.It says Parliament cannot ratify or implement any agreement on the UK's withdrawal and future relationship "unless and until they have been approved by the people of the UK in a confirmatory public ballot".The key bits: It basically requires Parliament to withhold its consent for any deal until it is approved in a referendum.Unlike Labour's motion, it does not specify what deal could be voted on or whether there should be an option to remain, thereby differentiating itself from the People's Vote campaign.Who's backing it?This was known around Westminster as the Kyle-Wilson amendment, as it's the idea of Labour MPs Peter Kyle and Phil Wilson, but it has been tabled by Labour MP Dame Margaret Beckett.They have a long list of Labour, Lib Dem, SNP, Independent Group supporters, and a smattering of Tory rebels.Revoking Article 50 The general idea: This requires the government to stop Brexit in its tracks if the UK gets to within days of its scheduled departure from the EU and the necessary legislation implementing any withdrawal deal has not been approved.The key bits: Talk of revoking Article 50 - the legal process by which the UK is leaving the EU - has been all the rage in the past week, with a petition backing the move attracting more than five million signatures.This motion obliges the government to act if the UK reaches "the penultimate House of Commons sitting day before exit day" and no law implementing Brexit has been passed.In such a situation, MPs would be asked to vote on a no-deal exit and if they rejected that, Article 50 would be revoked.Who's backing it?The prime mover is the Scottish lawyer and SNP MP Joanna Cherry, who was behind a legal challenge earlier this year to establish whether the UK could unilaterally revoke Article 50.Its supporters include Lib Dem leader Vince Cable and members of the Independent Group of MPs.Malthouse compromise Plan B The general idea: This looks a bit like the "managed no-deal" plan that was being touted by some cabinet Brexiteers.It would see an extended transition period to December 2021 to allow time to prepare for departure on World Trade Organisation terms or a revised version of the withdrawal agreement.The key bits: It would seek to reduce the 39bn "divorce bill" to the smallest amount possible - and introduce a "standstill period" with no tariffs and no new barriers to trade with the EU while talks are ongoing.The first part of the plan, Malthouse Plan A, which called for the current withdrawal agreement to be implemented with the "backstop" for the Irish border replaced by alternative arrangements, which had cross-party support, was not selected for debate Commons Speaker John Bercow.Who's backing it?Mostly Conservative Brexiteers, including Marcus Fysh, Steve Baker and Priti Patel.
Brexit: What are indicative votes?:::::Image copyright UK Parliament MPs have decided to try to break the Brexit deadlock by holding a series of "indicative votes".But what does it mean?Indicative votes are where MPs vote on a series of options designed to test the will of Parliament to see what, if anything, commands a majority.In the case of Brexit, supporters of indicative votes believe it could provide a way out of the current political stalemate.How will it work?Usually the government has control over what happens day-to-day in Parliament, but on Monday evening MPs backed a proposal by a cross-party group of MPs, including Labour's Hilary Benn and Conservative Sir Oliver Letwin, to take control of the timetable.Under the cross-party plan, MPs can put forward their preferred Brexit plans this evening to Speaker John Bercow.Tomorrow he will select all or some of these options for debate.MPs may be asked to consider whether any plan agreed by Parliament should be put back to the public in another referendum, or whether the UK should stop Brexit altogether by revoking its notification of Article 50.Following a debate on the various options, at 7pm the Commons will be suspended for 30 minutes so MPs can vote on the each plan.During the indicative votes, MPs will enter one of the division lobbies - the corridors in the House of Commons where votes are normally counted - and will receive a paper ballot.They can vote "yes" or "no" on as many options as they are prepared to support.The results will be announced by the Speaker later that evening.After the results are in and options are narrowed, a second round of voting could also take place next Monday to find a single preference.It is unclear if the voting system will remain the same for this.Among the possible ideas are: Would MPs be forced to vote a particular way?Usually, MPs are instructed to vote with their party line (a process known as "whipping") and they can face repercussions if they don't.But with indicative votes, MPs might be allowed "free votes" - where they can choose to vote as they wish - meaning the final outcome could be substantially different.Government ministers have indicated free votes are likely.Does it tie the government's hands?Any decision taken by indicative votes would not compel the government into pursuing that course of action, but would show what Parliament wants and where the most votes lie.However, there is always a risk that either no single Brexit option secures a majority, or more than one does.If this happens then Parliament would still find itself deadlocked over Brexit.If certain options such as Norway plus or another referendum are chosen and enacted by the government, it would require a longer extension to Article 50.The Prime Minister Theresa May has also warned that the votes could lead to an outcome which the EU would not agree to.Have they happened before?Yes.One occasion indicative votes were used was in 2003 when MPs were presented with seven different options on how to reform the House of Lords.It produced exactly the deadlock some fear would be the case over Brexit as nothing was able to secure a majority.This meant reforms were not passed and the status quo prevailed.But haven't MPs already voted on all the options?MPs have had a number of opportunities to vote on different ways forward, and, as Mrs May has pointed out, they have "equally been rejected".But these were all "whipped" votes and each proposal was taken in isolation, rather than side by side.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: How could another referendum on leaving the EU work?:::::Image copyright Getty Images With Parliament still deadlocked over Brexit, EU leaders have agreed to Theresa May's request to delay the UK's departure date for a second time.Under the plan, the UK is now scheduled to leave on 31 October 2019.One option to break the political stalemate, could be to offer the public a new Brexit vote.The Electoral Commission has told BBC News it has "contingency plans in place" and is ready "to respond quickly to any unscheduled poll".So how would another referendum on the UK's membership of the EU work?Passing the legislation To allow a referendum to happen, legislation would first of all need to be passed in Parliament.This would set the rules of the poll and the regulation of the campaign.That would mean the majority of MPs would need to support the idea of holding another vote.It took seven months before Parliament signed off the previous legislation which led to the 2016 referendum.But could it be done more quickly this time?One possible option is to use the 2015 Act as a template and, in effect, copy over large chunks to speed the process up."This could be done very quickly in theory," says Alan Renwick, deputy director of the Constitution Unit at University College London.If it were shortened in this way, Mr Renwick estimates it would still take about 11 weeks to get through Parliament.Based on that timetable, it would take until late June for the bill to be passed - and that's if the process started now.But the legislation could take much longer to pass if there was a lot of disagreement amongst MPs.For example, should there be multiple options on the ballot paper, as opposed to the straightforward choice of "Leave" or "Remain" in 2016?The question In the end it would be up to Parliament to decide what the question might be.The People's Vote campaign, which wants a referendum on a final Brexit deal, says a choice between the deal and remaining in the EU is their preference but it doesn't rule out the possibility of voters having three options.Justine Greening, a former Conservative cabinet minister who supports another referendum, has previously called for three choices when people come to vote: accept a negotiated Brexit deal stay in the EU leave with no deal On the other hand, some argue that if there was to be another vote, "Remain" should not appear on the ballot paper and it should be a straight choice between a Brexit deal and leaving the EU with no deal.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Justine Greening favours a second referendum and says voters should have three options If there were several options, MPs would also need to decide what voting system to use - ie would voters make one choice or vote in order of preference?The Electoral Commission would also need to test the proposed question and ensure it was presented "clearly, simply and neutrally".The campaign Once the legislation is passed, official campaign groups would have to be selected.The Commission would need to provide information to voters about how to take part in the referendum and ensure there were enough counting officers in place around the country.Once that's out the way, there's the campaign - which usually lasts four weeks - and the vote itself.The Electoral Commission told BBC News all of this would take a minimum of 10 weeks - from passing the legislation to holding the vote, as set out in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.So adding together the time to pass the legislation and organising a campaign, the process would take a minimum of 22 weeks says Alan Renwick.The 10-day referendum But it's not unheard of for countries to hold referendums on much tighter timescales.Three years ago, Greece organised a referendum in just over a week, in which voters rejected the terms of an international bailout following the country's debt crisis.However, Alan Renwick says that if referendums are organised too hastily, it can give the impression that "normal procedure is not being followed" and that voters may see the eventual result as illegitimate.A referendum similar to Greece's timescale, for example, would not allow enough time to organise postal votes and assess the question on the ballot paper.What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter
Article 50: Can the UK revoke Brexit?:::::Image copyright Getty Images Prime Minister Theresa May has been granted another Brexit delay by European Union (EU) leaders with a new deadline date of 31 October.European Council President Donald Tusk said the UK should use the extra time to either pass the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the UK and the EU, rethink its strategy or "cancel Brexit altogether."If the UK chose this last option, it would mean revoking something called Article 50.Article 50 This is the part of the Lisbon Treaty which sets out what happens when a country decides that it wants to leave the EU.It was triggered by Theresa May on 29 March 2017, starting a two-year countdown to leaving - although this period has now been extended twice.A petition calling for Article 50 to be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit - has been signed by more than six million people.But Theresa May has said that it should not be revoked.How could Article 50 be revoked?The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruling last year confirmed that the UK could revoke Article 50 itself, without having to ask the other 27 EU countries for permission.This could be done by writing a letter to the European Council, made up of EU heads of state.The ECJ said the UK would then remain a member of the EU on the same terms - as it has now - including keeping its budget rebate.But it did set some conditions.The ruling said revocation should be "unequivocal and unconditional", suggesting that the UK could not simply revoke Article 50 in order to buy more time and then resubmit it at a later date.A senior lawyer at the ECJ said that "appropriate legal instruments" could be used if a member state tried to trigger and revoke Article 50 in order to secure a better withdrawal deal.Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button Who decides?Theresa May or Parliament?On this, the ECJ did not give a definitive answer.The court ruled that: "Revocation must be decided following a democratic process in accordance with national constitutional requirements."The UK government has a power known as the Royal Prerogative, which allows it to do certain things including deploying armed forces, granting honours and altering international treaties without consulting Parliament.So it is possible in theory that Mrs May would be able to revoke Article 50 without giving MPs the chance to vote on it.But there are limits to that power, and those limits have been tested during the course of the Brexit process.Their use to activate the two year Article 50 negotiating period was challenged by Gina Miller at the beginning of 2017.The Supreme Court ruled in her case that the government could not trigger the EU exit process without bringing it before Parliament.Because an act of Parliament was required to trigger Article 50, it has been suggested revoking it would also need parliamentary approval."The balance of opinion is that the safest and most secure legal route is to enact a very short piece of legislation to authorise the prime minister to revoke," according to Kenneth Armstrong, professor of European law at the University of Cambridge.Although some lawyers believe a letter from the prime minister would do.That's if Theresa May were to make the decision - but what if Parliament wanted to force her hand?They could potentially do this by taking control of Parliamentary business, as happened last month enabling Labour MP Yvette Cooper to pass legislation compelling the Prime Minister to seek a Brexit extension.In the same way, if there were a majority to do so, MPs might be able to instruct the Prime Minister to revoke Article 50.Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: Can May still bring back her deal after Bercow statement?:::::Image copyright EPA Here is the relevant commandment from Erskine May aka the parliamentary bible: "A motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session, may not be brought forward again during that same session."So, how can the government get round this rather large obstacle and get another vote on Theresa May's deal?Change the rules... Well, first of all, rules are there to be changed.If MPs suspend or change the "standing orders" of Parliament, they could get the Brexit deal back on the agenda.But here the power would be in the hands of Parliament as a whole, and could not be done at the whim of government ministers.Change the offer... Secondly, the government could change the proposition on offer.The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has suggested that something "substantially" different would be to ask Parliament to vote for the deal subject to a referendum.It may be argued too that moving the Brexit date from 29 March to a later date would be substantial enough if Mrs May tacks this on to her deal.But the Speaker can set a high bar here.In response to MPs' questions, he has hinted that simply coming up with new legal advice or clarifications wouldn't be substantial enough.Change the Parliament...So, already there is a focus on the word "session" in Erskine May.If MPs can't discuss the same thing in the same session of Parliament, why not simply start a new one?In the parlance, Parliament would be "prorogued" - in other words, the Queen would end the current session and a new one would begin soon after.But this strategy would be extremely controversial, and may even be resisted by Buckingham Palace if it appeared that the monarchy was being used in a politically contentious way.
Brexit: Does the UK need to hold European elections?:::::Image copyright Getty Images It is becoming a key question in this complex Brexit process.If the UK was to request, or be offered, a lengthy extension of its membership of the European Union (EU), would there be an obligation to take part in May's European elections?Both the UK government and the European Commission (EC) say that there would; but legal opinion is divided, and many lawyers argue that a satisfactory fix could be found.The elections are taking place between 23 and 26 May, although the new parliament will not sit, and new members will not be sworn in, until 2 July.That is why it has been argued that an extension of Article 50 until the end of June would not prove to be a problem.But what about a much longer extension - potentially as long as 21 months until the end of 2020?That takes the debate into much trickier legal and political territory.The issue has taken on renewed relevance after the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, wrote in a tweet that he will appeal to the 27 other EU leaders over the next few days "to be open to a long extension if the UK finds it necessary to rethink its Brexit strategy".What does the government say?Theresa May has indicated that she would only favour a "short technical extension" to the UK's EU membership, if that was necessary in order to turn a last-minute agreement into law.But a longer extension, she told MPs, "would undoubtedly require the United Kingdom to hold European Parliament (EP) elections in May 2019".And the European Commission agrees?Yes - as the "guardian of the treaties", the Commission has strong views on this.In a letter to Mr Tusk on March 11, Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said that if the UK is still part of the EU at the end of May "it will be legally required to hold these elections, in line with the rights and obligations of all Member States as set out in the Treaties".There is no question that the UK would be in breach of those treaty obligations if it failed to hold elections.But how much would that matter, if the UK was on a path out of the EU anyway?What do others think?That is an unresolved debate that may eventually have to be tested in court.A legal opinion issued by the German Bundestag's Europe Department says that Article 50 cannot be extended beyond the end of May unless the UK holds elections.It suggests that the European Commission might choose to begin treaty infringement proceedings against the UK for denying the vote to UK or EU citizens in the UK.The UK's Department for Exiting the European Union argues that the UK would have to take part in the elections because "the EU Treaties provide that EU citizens have the right to be represented" and the European Parliament "needs to be properly constituted with duly elected representatives from all Member States" in order to perform its functions.But others disagree.A confidential legal opinion, written by the European Parliament's own legal service and seen by the BBC, argues that the new parliament could be legally constituted even if the UK had not taken part in the elections."The potential infringement by a Member State of its duties and responsibilities under the Treaties and the Electoral Act cannot amount," the opinion says, "to an absolute bar to the regular functioning of the Institution."So what happens next?If the UK didn't take part in the elections, there would be considerable concern about legal challenges, either from those who might argue that their right to be represented was being denied, or from those who might argue that the UK was paying money into the EU budget without receiving all the benefits.But representation is not necessarily the same thing as holding elections.When countries join the EU, there have been periods when national MPs have been appointed to serve as representatives in the European Parliament until the next European elections take place.This happened with Romania and Bulgaria in 2007.Could a similar temporary measure apply as an existing EU member seeks to leave?Perhaps.Another alternative that has been suggested is that the UK's current MEPs could continue to sit in the next European Parliament until the end of the Article 50 period, or they could be granted some form of observer status.All of this is uncharted legal territory.Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Jean-Claude Juncker says the UK "will be legally required to hold these elections" if it is still part of the EU at the end of May But the UK's most senior lawyer at the European Court of Justice, Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston, seems convinced that a solution can be found.There would be a need, she wrote on Twitter, "to arrange for British MEPs to sit in the new (parliament) as additional members on a temporary 'Brexit-limited' basis".Any suggestion that the European elections represent an "insuperable obstacle" to a longer extension of Article 50 is, she added, "an oversimplified and ultimately fallacious presentation of the facts".Ms Sharpston emphasised that she was writing in a personal capacity, but her opinion clearly carries some weight."If the political will to agree a longer extension of Article 50 is there, she concluded, "a legal mechanism can be found to accommodate that desire and 'deal with' the issue of the EP elections."Article 50 A legal solution could be found within Article 50 itself.It is already being used to offer the UK an extensive transition period after Brexit, even though it does not mention transition explicitly."An argument could be made that extending existing MEPs also qualifies as a transitional arrangement," says Catherine Barnard, professor of EU law at the University of Cambridge, "The formal position is that the UK would need to hold elections," Prof Barnard says."But it is likely that those MEPs would only serve for a maximum of two years, so it would be in the interest of both sides to find a creative solution."One possibility is to see how far Article 50 can be stretched."Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter
Brexit: What votes does Theresa May need for her deal to pass?:::::Image copyright Reuters Theresa May will put her Brexit deal to the House of Commons later for a second "meaningful vote" as she seeks approval for her updated plan.Last time the prime minister put her deal to MPs, she lost by a historic 230 votes.What support does Mrs May need to ensure her Brexit deal passes tonight?The magic number of MPs the prime minister needs to back her deal is 318 - that is if everyone who can vote does so.When MPs voted on the deal in January, 432 voted against, but 202 voted in favour.That means, if there are no abstentions from the vote later - when an MP does not vote either way - Mrs May needs to convince 116 more MPs from any side of the House to change their minds and support her.Persuading the rebels There were 118 Tory rebels who voted against the deal last time, but three of them - Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston - have now left the party and joined the Independent Group, who are expected to vote against the deal.So even if Mrs May persuaded the other 115 Conservative rebels to toe the party line, she would still be one short of securing her deal.The PM may have been hoping to convince the 10 members of the Democratic Unionist Party - her confidence-and-supply partners in the Commons who, in normal cases, give her a working majority - to change their minds and vote for a deal.But earlier, a statement from the party confirmed they would be voting against it.Hope from the opposition?There may be hope for the PM from the Labour benches.Although the party's leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he and his MPs will vote against, it is thought some have been convinced to back the deal and vote in favour.This could cancel out the need for DUP votes to get it through, but only if there are no Conservative rebels.And here is where the European Research Group - the Conservative Brexiteer backbenchers who also voted down her deal in January - could come into play.We are still waiting to hear from some of the major figures in the group on which way they will go later.But a number of members have already rejected the deal, meaning the PM is unlikely to get a clean slate from her own benches.We will know shortly after the vote at 19:00 GMT tonight whether the magic number has been reached or not.
Brexit: 10 ways you could be affected by no-deal:::::Image copyright Getty Images The EU has said Brexit can be delayed from 29 March by two weeks, with that date being pushed back further if Theresa May's withdrawal agreement gets through Parliament.But if MPs still don't agree on it, the UK has to propose a way forward - and European Council President Donald Tusk has said that the UK government would face "a choice between a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50".With all options still on the table, how would you be affected if the UK leaves the EU with no deal?1.The contents of your shopping basket may change What you find on the supermarket shelves could well be where you see the first effects.About 30% of our food currently comes from the EU, and it is likely that some foods, such as fresh vegetables and fruit, will become more expensive in the event of no deal.Increased import taxes and transport delays could all mean a rise in prices.And if a no-deal Brexit was followed by a fall in the value of the pound, that would also have the same effect.Supermarkets themselves have already warned that there could be empty shelves and higher prices.And Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said that, in a worst-case scenario, our shopping bills could increase by 10%.The government has said that while a no-deal Brexit alone won't lead to food shortages, consumer behaviour could.Panic buying could mean food retailers run short of some products.Supermarkets say they have been stockpiling some foods - but they are unable to do that for some fresh fruit and veg.2.You will need to take extra measures when travelling to Europe Millions of people from the UK travel abroad each year - the vast majority of journeys made to Europe.If you are planning to make a journey to an EU member state after Brexit, the government is advising you to check you have the right paperwork.Flights and Eurostar The government and the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) have both said that flights to and from the UK would still operate in a no-deal scenario.And Eurostar bosses have said they are working to ensure their services run as smoothly as possible, despite a government assessment that warned of long queues at London's St Pancras International, the main Eurostar terminal in the UK.Visas In terms of paperwork, you won't need a visa for stays in countries in the Schengen area - where passports are not required and all other types of border control have been abolished (full list here) - of up to 90 days out of any 180-day period.However, you may need a visa if you intend to stay for longer.Passports Image copyright PA The government is also advising you to make sure your passport is valid for at least six months if you are travelling to the Schengen area.Until recently, UK citizens who renewed their passport before it expired could have up to nine months of the remaining validity added to their new travel document.But the government has now warned that this time carried over will not count towards the six-month requirement after a no-deal Brexit.You can check if your passport has enough time left with this government tool.For countries that are in the EU but not in the Schengen area (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania), you'll need to check the entry requirements for the country you're travelling to before you travel.Travel to Ireland is subject to separate Common Travel Area arrangements, which will remain the same after the UK leaves the EU.Bank cards If you have a UK bank account and intend to use your bank card to pay for goods and services while you are in the EU as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (the European Economic Area), the government has warned that it may become more expensive.European health cover In addition, if there is no deal, then in theory the cover provided by your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) would cease to exist.The government is advising travellers to buy insurance to cover health care "just as you would if visiting a non-EU country".Driving If you intend to drive in the EU after exit, you may need an International Driving Permit and a green card from your insurer.3.You may need to check medication is available and it may be more expensive Ministers and NHS leaders say every effort is being made to ensure there will be enough medicines and clinical equipment available in the event of delays to imports from the EU.Measures taken include: a six-week stockpile of essential medicines a plane chartered to fly in medical devices and clinical consumables that can't be stockpiled warehouses with refrigeration capacity rented ports other than Dover and Folkestone prepared to take ferries with lorries carrying imported medical supplies However, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society warned in January that pharmacists were struggling to obtain common medicines - including painkillers and anti-depressants.While there are regular fluctuations in medicine supplies, there are concerns a no-deal Brexit could make shortages worse.Pharmacists have advised patients to order medicines in advance to give them time to deal with requests.And the Royal College of Radiologists has told doctors to prepare for delays in some drugs used to detect cancer, by reducing their workload in the days after the UK leaves the EU.4.UK nationals living abroad may have to take extra measures About 1.3 million UK-born people live in the other 27 EU countries.The government is advising UK nationals living in the EU, the EEA or Switzerland to take steps to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.These will differ according to the country being lived in.The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country.There is country-specific government advice here.Health UK nationals living in, working in, or visiting the EU may find their access to healthcare in EU member states will change after the UK leaves the EU.If you are eligible, you should register for healthcare under your country's local rules.You may have to be a long-term legal resident or pay social security contributions to access free or discounted healthcare.The government recommends you get health insurance while you are applying for residency.UK students studying abroad are also advised to buy health insurance.Information on how to access healthcare abroad can be found on the NHS website.Pensions The UK government will continue to pay state pension, child benefits, and disability benefits to eligible UK nationals in the EU.Tax The UK's exit from the EU will not change existing double taxation arrangements.These ensure everyone - not just British citizens - living in a country that has a treaty with the UK will not pay tax in two countries on the same income/gain, and determine which country has primary taxing rights.5.EU citizens need to apply for 'settled status' The UK government has reached an agreement with the EU, as well as Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland, that will protect the rights of EU citizens and their family members who are living in the UK.There are currently 3.8 million EU citizens living in the UK.If you are an EU citizen and living in the UK, the government has a tool to find out what you need to do and when.Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button 6.Importing goods from the EU may get more expensive Importing goods from the EU is likely to get more expensive when free movement of goods ends with the UK's departure.As a member of the EU, UK firms don't have to pay extra duties, taxes or have customs checks on goods travelling to or from the EU.But after a no-deal Brexit, new rules will apply.Earlier this month, the government published a 1,477-page document outlining their plan for tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Under the temporary scheme, 87% of imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access.At the moment 80% of imports are tariff free.Tariffs would be maintained to protect some industries, including agriculture.Beef, lamb, poultry and some dairy products would receive protection.7.House prices could be affected Most commentators and industry experts agree uncertainty created by the Brexit process is causing buyers and sellers to sit tight, causing a slowdown in the housing market.UK house prices grew at the slowest annual rate for nearly six years in January, according to the Nationwide.It said it was likely that the recent slowdown in the market was due to "the impact of the uncertain economic outlook on buyer sentiment".The Bank of England says the impact of the UK leaving the EU on the housing market could be significant.It has said house prices could fall by up to 30% from pre-Brexit levels if there was no deal, or a "disorderly Brexit".Property agents Savills suggest buyer confidence will have a bigger role to play than affordability in house price movements this year.8.Mobile phone roaming charges may rise Using your mobile in the EU may be more expensive in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the government has warned.The amounts EU mobile operators would be able to charge UK operators for providing roaming services would no longer be regulated after Brexit.Digital, Culture and Media Secretary Jeremy Wright has said although mobile operators will be able to implement roaming charges if they want to, the government would be legislating to put a 45-a-month limit on the amount customers could be charged.To be safe, the government advises you to understand how to turn off data roaming on your mobile if you are worried about being charged.9.Some ports and motorways could see extra delays Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said there could be freight traffic disruption in Kent in the event of a no deal, if additional customs checks are introduced in Calais, Coquelles and Dunkirk - where freight services disembark.At the moment, freight vehicles going through Dover are subject to passport and security checks.But under a no-deal scenario, EU-bound lorries will also need to complete customs declarations, and certain goods may also require physical checks, and this could lead to bottlenecks.In this scenario, a traffic management system known as Operation Brock would come into force on a section of the M20.Traffic would be allowed to flow in both directions on the same carriageway, while lorries would be left queuing on the other side.If that proved to be insufficient, a disused airfield near Ramsgate would be used as a lorry park, and if further capacity was still required, the M26 could also be used.Kent County Council says it has employed extra staff and stockpiled supplies in preparation for six months of disruption in the event of no deal.10.UK students studying in the EU and EU students studying in the UK face a period of uncertainty More than 16,000 British students studied on placements organised by the Erasmus study abroad scheme - in place since the 1980s - in 2016-17.UK universities say they would expect a similar number to be planning to do the same this coming academic year.The government is committed to funding everything already agreed, so people who have already started Erasmus trips will be able to continue them.But if the UK leaves the EU without a deal before the exchanges for the next academic year have been finalised, then the government would need European agreement to keep taking part.It has issued a technical note explaining this.That is true for both UK students planning to go to EU countries, and EU nationals hoping to come to the UK.Meanwhile, Universities UK has launched a campaign supporting opportunities for studying abroad.Remind yourself of the Brexit basics with: .
Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU:::::Here is an easy-to-understand guide to Brexit - beginning with the basics, then a look at the current negotiations, followed by a selection of answers to questions we've been sent.What does Brexit mean?It is a word that is used as a shorthand way of saying the UK leaving the EU - merging the words Britain and exit to get Brexit, in the same way as a possible Greek exit from the euro was dubbed Grexit in the past.Further reading: The rise of the word Brexit Why is Britain leaving the European Union?A referendum - a vote in which everyone (or nearly everyone) of voting age can take part - was held on Thursday 23 June, 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union.Leave won by 51.9% to 48.1%.The referendum turnout was 71.8%, with more than 30 million people voting.Find the result in your area What was the breakdown across the UK?England voted for Brexit, by 53.4% to 46.6%.Wales also voted for Brexit, with Leave getting 52.5% of the vote and Remain 47.5%.Scotland and Northern Ireland both backed staying in the EU.Scotland backed Remain by 62% to 38%, while 55.8% in Northern Ireland voted Remain and 44.2% Leave.See the results in more detail.What is the European Union?The European Union - often known as the EU - is an economic and political partnership involving 28 European countries (click here if you want to see the full list).It began after World War Two to foster economic co-operation, with the idea that countries which trade together were more likely to avoid going to war with each other.It has since grown to become a "single market" allowing goods and people to move around, basically as if the member states were one country.It has its own currency, the euro, which is used by 19 of the member countries, its own parliament and it now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport, consumer rights and even things such as mobile phone charges.Click here for a beginners' guide to how the EU works.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How does the European Union work?When is the UK due to leave the EU?The UK had been due to leave on 29 March 2019, two years after it started the exit process by invoking Article 50 of the EU's Lisbon Treaty.But the withdrawal agreement reached between the EU and UK has been rejected three times by UK MPs.Having granted an initial extension of the Article 50 process until 12 April 2019, EU leaders have now backed a six-month extension until 31 October 2019.However, the UK will leave before this date if the withdrawal agreement is ratified by the UK and the EU before then.So is Brexit definitely happening?As things stand, the UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 31 October 2019.If the UK and EU ratify the withdrawal agreement before then, the UK will leave on the first day of the following month.But could Brexit be cancelled?Yes.Stopping Brexit would require a change in the law in the UK, something neither the government nor the main UK opposition parties want to do at this point.The European Court of Justice ruled on 10 December 2018 that the UK could cancel the Article 50 Brexit process without the permission of the other 27 EU members, and remain a member of the EU on its existing terms, provided the decision followed a "democratic process", in other words, if Parliament voted for it.In March, an online petition calling for Article 50 to be revoked gained over six million signatures.Could Brexit be delayed?Theresa May has said she wants the UK to leave the EU as soon as possible, if possible by 22 May, so the UK will not have to take part in the European Parliament elections taking place across Europe that month.The EU has said the Brexit process should not be extended again beyond 31 October 2019, but legally speaking another extension could happen if all EU countries, including the UK, agree to it.Could there be another referendum?It would have to be put into law by the government, which has previously ruled it out.But having failed three times to get MPs to support her withdrawal deal, Theresa May has held talks with Jeremy Corbyn about finding a way forward.Some Labour MPs want Mr Corbyn to make a "confirmatory vote" on any deal a condition of any agreement.If Labour and the Conservatives fail to reach an agreement, MPs will face a series of votes on Brexit options, which could include another referendum.Mrs May has said her government "stands ready to abide by the decision of the House" if Labour does the same.MPs have twice rejected a "confirmatory vote" in Commons votes although the second attempt saw an increased number back it.Why do politicians want a deal?The main point of having a deal between the UK and the EU is to ensure as smooth as possible an exit from the EU for businesses and individuals - and to allow time for the two sides to hammer out a permanent trading relationship.What is in Theresa May's deal with the EU?After months of negotiation, the UK and EU agreed a Brexit deal.It comes in two parts.A 585-page withdrawal agreement.This is a legally-binding text that sets the terms of the UK's divorce from the EU.It covers how much money the UK owes the EU - an estimated 39bn - and what happens to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and EU citizens living in the UK.It also proposes a method of avoiding the return of a physical Northern Ireland border.A 26-page statement on future relations.This is not legally-binding and sketches out the kind of long-term relationship the UK and EU want to have in a range of areas, including trade, defence and security.What is the transition period?This is part of the withdrawal agreement, which so far, has not been approved by MPs.It refers to a period of time after Brexit until 31 December, 2020 (or possibly later), to get everything in place and allow businesses and others to prepare for the moment when the new post-Brexit rules between the UK and the EU begin.It would also allow more time for the details of the new relationship to be fully hammered out.Free movement would continue during the transition period, as the EU wanted.The UK would be able to strike its own trade deals - although they wouldn't be able to come into force until 1 January 2021.But it all rests on the withdrawal deal being ratified.Could we leave without a deal?Yes.This is the so-called no-deal Brexit.What would happen if the UK left without a deal?The UK would sever all ties with the EU with immediate effect, with no transition period and no guarantees on citizens' rights of residence.The government fears this would cause significant disruption to businesses in the short-term, with lengthy tailbacks of lorries at the channel ports, as drivers face new checks on their cargos.Food retailers have warned of shortages of fresh produce and the NHS is stockpiling medicines, in case supplies from EU countries are interrupted.Government ministers and multinational companies with factories in the UK have also warned about the long-term impact on the British economy.Brexit-supporting MPs claim it would not be as bad as they say and the UK would save on the 39bn divorce bill, as well as being free to strike its own beneficial trade deals around the world.Here is a collection of papers published by the government on a 'no-deal' Would trade with the EU continue?The World Trade Organization sets rules for countries that don't have free trade deals with each other, including tariffs - the taxes charged on the import of goods.Without an agreement on trade, the UK would trade with the EU under World Trade Organization rules.Here is a full explanation of what that would mean.Is Theresa May's Brexit deal now dead?Theresa May's deal cannot come into effect until it has been passed by Parliament.It has now been heavily defeated in two "meaningful" votes, and a third vote just on the withdrawal agreement itself, governing the terms of the UK's departure, not the "future relationship", a non-binding bit of the deal which maps out aspirations for long-term trade, economic and security cooperation and more.She has told EU leaders that her cross-party talks with Labour are "based on acceptance of the withdrawal agreement without reopening it" - with the aim of getting it - and a "shared vision for the future relationship", which could be subject to some change, approved by the Commons.So she has not ruled out having another go at getting it ratified - and hopes that reaching out to Labour can help break the deadlock.There is a separate sticking point about whether Speaker John Bercow will allow her to bring the deal back again for another vote.What is the backstop?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop When the UK leaves the EU, the 310-mile border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will become the land border between the UK and the European Union.Neither side wants to see a return to checkpoints, towers, customs posts or surveillance cameras at the border, in case it reignites the Troubles and disrupts the free cross-border flow of trade and people.But they can't agree on a way to do that.The UK and EU agreed to put in place a "backstop" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU.The backstop agreed between the two parties would keep Northern Ireland aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards.That would prevent the need for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls.The backstop would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union.If future trade talks broke down without a deal, the backstop would apply indefinitely.The arrangement would end only with the agreement of both the UK and the EU.Why are so many MPs against it?The backstop was a key sticking point for many MPs who voted down the deal.They feared it could leave Britain tied to the EU indefinitely with no say over its rules and no ability to strike trade deals with other countries.Are there any solutions to it?If there were an obvious solution that people agreed guaranteed no return of a hard border in Ireland it would probably have been implemented by now.Possible alternatives suggested include a "trusted trader" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border, "mutual recognition" of rules with the EU and "technological" solutions.However the EU has insisted that the backstop plan is necessary.Ask me Where does Theresa May stand on Brexit?Theresa May was against Brexit during the referendum campaign but is now in favour of it because she says it is what the British people want.She triggered the two year process of leaving the EU on 29 March, 2017.She set out her negotiating goals in a letter to the EU council president Donald Tusk.She outlined her plans for a transition period after Brexit in a big speech in Florence, Italy.She then set out her thinking on the kind of trading relationship the UK wants with the EU, in a speech in March 2018.Is she safe as prime minister?Theresa May has been in a precarious position because she lost her House of Commons majority in the 2017 general election.She has survived two attempts to remove her from office so far.The first, in December 2018, was from a group of her own MPs unhappy at her Brexit policy, who organised a no confidence vote in her as Conservative leader.She survived by 200 votes to 117.She is now immune from another attempt to oust her as Tory leader until December 2019.The second was from the Labour Party, who held a no confidence vote in her government after her Brexit plan was voted down in January 2019.All MPs were able to take part in this and she survived by 19 votes.Unlike the internal Tory no confidence vote, there is no limit to the number of times she could face a confidence vote in Parliament and Labour have not ruled out holding further ones.However Mrs May herself has told Tory MPs she will resign, if MPs back her deal, so someone else can lead the next phase of Brexit negotiations, so her time in the top job is limited.What is the Labour Party's position on Brexit?Image copyright PA Labour says it accepts the referendum result and that Brexit is going to happen.But it opposes Theresa May's Brexit plan, and wants to stop it and force a general election.In February, it said it was prepared to back another EU referendum, to prevent a "damaging Tory Brexit", having failed to win a vote of no-confidence against the government.Leader Jeremy Corbyn says he would negotiate a permanent customs union with the EU after Brexit, which would be very similar to the one it has now.This is the only way to keep trade flowing freely and protect jobs, he says, as well as ensuring there is no return to a "hard border" in Northern Ireland.He has ruled out staying a member of the single market, as some of his pro-EU MPs want, so he can carry out his plans to nationalise key industries without being hampered by EU competition rules.He says the UK should have a very close relationship with the single market.Labour accepts that some form of free movement of people might have to continue.IF THERE IS A DEAL WITH THE EU What happens to EU citizens living in the UK and UK citizens in the EU?An agreement between the UK and the EU provides what Theresa May says is certainty to the 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK - as well as citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland that they will be able to carry on living and working in the UK as they have done with their rights enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts.UK citizens in the EU will also retain their current rights with what the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker called a cheap and simple administration procedure.The proposal provides a cut-off date of Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - for those to be covered by the rules.Babies born after that date to people who have qualified under these rules will be included in the agreement.Under the plan EU citizens legally resident in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be able to leave for up to five years before losing the rights they will have as part of the proposed Brexit deal.How will EU citizens apply for the new status?The UK government is launching an online system to allow EU citizens to apply for settled status on 30 March.The government had originally planned to charge people 65 to use it but that fee has now been dropped and it is free.Anyone who had already paid, when the scheme was being tested, will be reimbursed.What about EU nationals who want to work in the UK?Any EU citizen already living and working in the UK will be able to carry on working and living in the UK after Brexit.The current plan is that even after Brexit, people from the EU will be able to move to work in the UK during a "transition" phase of about two years.There is also some debate over whether they will have the same rights as those who came before, with possible restrictions on access to benefits or to vote in local elections.The EU wants them to have the same rights as now - the UK doesn't.What exactly happens after the transition period has yet to be decided, but the proposal is for a work permit system along the lines of that for non-EU nationals (see below).Will immigration be cut?Image copyright PA Prime Minister Theresa May said one of the main messages she took from the Leave vote was that the British people wanted to see a reduction in immigration.She has insisted the UK government remains committed to reducing annual net migration - the difference between the number of people entering and leaving - to below 100,000.Home Secretary Sajid Javid has declined to commit to this, however.Instead, he has said it will be brought down to "sustainable" levels.Mr Javid published the government's long-awaited post-Brexit immigration plans in December.Free movement of people from the EU will effectively continue until the end of the transition period in December 2020.After that, people from the EU will need visas to work in the UK, with priority given to skilled workers - the same system that currently applies to migrants from outside the EU.A consultation is being held on a minimum salary requirement of 30,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas.However, tens of thousands of low-skilled migrants could come to the UK to work for up to a year to protect parts of the economy that rely on overseas labour.That measure would last until 2025.Visitors from the EU will not need visas.More details here.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?No.Under the Brexit deal, EU citizens and UK nationals will continue to be able to travel freely with a passport or identity card until the end of the transition period in December 2020.After this period ends, the European Commission has offered visa-free travel for UK nationals coming to the EU for a short stay, as long as the UK offers the same in return.British citizens will, however, have to pay 7 (6.30) every three years to travel to EU countries, because of a new security system for countries in the passport-free Schengen zone.Will I still be able to use my passport?Yes.It is a British document - there is no such thing as an EU passport, so your passport will stay the same.The government has decided to change the colour to blue for anyone applying for a new or replacement British passport from October 2019.Could the transition period be extended?If no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead.This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now.They could do this only once.The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely.But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be.Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022.Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about.IF THERE IS A NO-DEAL BREXIT Will EU nationals have to leave the UK?Mrs May has said EU citizens in the UK will be able to stay even if there is no deal done on Brexit.It's worth saying that even if no Brexit deal was done, EU nationals with a right to permanent residence, which is granted after they have lived in the UK for five years, should not see their rights affected after Brexit.What about Brits living in EU countries?There is uncertainty about what no deal would mean for Britons living in France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere.The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules - including deadlines for paperwork - vary from country to country.More details here.Will I need a visa to travel to the EU?If the UK leaves without a deal, British citizens who travel to the EU for up to 90 days will not have to apply for a visa - as long as the UK grants reciprocal visa-free travel for all EU citizens in return.The law confirming this arrangement has been adopted by the European Parliament, and now awaits the final sign-off from EU countries.It would come into force whenever the UK leaves the EU, regardless of whether a withdrawal agreement is reached.In the longer term, the EU is planning to launch an electronic application form, called ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System), for many non-EU countries, including the UK.It would involve paying a fee of 7 (6.30) every three years.More details here What about healthcare rights?Image copyright Thinkstock No deal would mean the current reciprocal healthcare, shared by the UK and the EU27, would no longer apply.It could send health insurance premiums soaring for UK citizens who need sufficient cover for holidays or work in the EU.Britons could also find their European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) - a passport to emergency medical treatment - is no longer valid in some EU countries.Read more here What's going to happen to all the EU laws in force in the UK?All existing EU laws will be copied across into UK law, to prevent legislative "black holes", under the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal Bill).The UK government can then decide over a period of time which ones it wants to keep, change or ditch.SOME KEY BREXIT QUESTIONS Will the UK be able to rejoin the EU in the future?BBC Europe editor Katya Adler says the UK would have to start from scratch with no rebate, and enter accession talks with the EU.Every member state would have to agree to the UK re-joining.But she says with elections looming elsewhere in Europe, other leaders might not be generous towards any UK demands.New members are required to adopt the euro as their currency, once they meet the relevant criteria, although the UK could try to negotiate an opt-out.Has immigration come down since the UK voted to leave the EU?According to the latest figures from the Office of National Statistics, net migration to the UK from non-EU countries was 261,000 in the twelve months to September 2018 - the highest since 2004.By contrast, net migration from EU countries was 57,000 - a level last seen in 2009.In other words, the result of the referendum appears to have already had an impact before Brexit has actually happened.How much has Brexit cost so far and how much will it cost by the end?There is much debate about the long-term costs and benefits to the UK economy of Brexit - but what we do know for certain is that the EU wants the UK to settle any outstanding bills before it leaves.The 39bn "divorce bill" will cover things like pension payments to EU officials, the cost of relocating London-based EU agencies and outstanding EU budget commitments.But the calculation of an exact UK share will depend on exchange rates, on interest rates, on the number of financial commitments that never turn into payments, and more.The UK says that if there is no deal agreed on Brexit it would pay substantially less and focus only on its "strict international legal obligations".Why pay anything?The UK could leave without any Brexit "divorce bill" deal but that would probably mean everyone ending up in court battles.If compromise can be achieved, and if payment of the bill were to be spread over many years, the amounts involved may not be that significant economically.Will the EU still use English?Yes, says BBC Europe editor Katya Adler.There will still be 27 other EU states in the bloc, and others wanting to join in the future, and the common language tends to be English - "much to France's chagrin", she says.Will Brexit harm product safety?Probably not, is the answer.It would depend on whether or not the UK decided to get rid of current safety standards.Even if that happened any company wanting to export to the EU would have to comply with its safety rules, and it's hard to imagine a company would want to produce two batches of the same products.Will cars need new number plates?If there is a no-deal Brexit, drivers may need a GB sticker if they are travelling to an EU member state, even if their car has a Euro-plate (a number plate displaying both the EU flag and a GB sign).You will not need a GB sticker to drive outside the UK if you replace a Euro-plate with a number plate that features the GB sign without the EU flag, the Department of Transport says.THE ECONOMY What has happened to the UK economy since the Brexit vote?David Cameron, his Chancellor George Osborne and many other senior figures who wanted to stay in the EU predicted an immediate economic crisis if the UK voted to leave and it is true that the pound slumped the day after the referendum - and is currently about 10% down against the dollar, and 10%-15% down against the euro.Predictions of immediate doom were wrong, with the UK economy estimated to have grown 1.8% in 2016, second only to Germany's 1.9% among the world's G7 leading industrialised nations.The UK economy continued to grow at almost the same rate in 2017 but slowed to 1.4% in 2018, the slowest rate since 2012.Inflation rose after June 2016, reaching a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017.However it has since eased, to stand at 1.8%.Unemployment has continued to fall, to stand at a 43-year year low of 3.9%.Annual house price increases have steadily fallen from 8.2% in June 2016 to 0.6% in the year to February 2019, according to official ONS figures.Read More: How has business been affected by Brexit?What does the fall in the value of the pound mean for prices in the shops?Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Shoppers will need to keep a close eye on how much they are spending People travelling overseas from the UK since the Brexit vote have found their pound buys less.A fall in the pound means exports get a boost as UK goods will be cheaper to buy in other countries, but some imported goods could get more expensive.The UK inflation figure for the year to December 2018 was 2%, above the target level, but not out of kilter with recent years.Has Brexit made house prices fall?Image copyright PA The average price for property continued to increase after June 2016's EU referendum, although the annual growth rate slowed from 8.2% in the year to June 2016 to 0.6% in the year to February 2019, according to official ONS figures.However, the exact extent to which this is solely due to Brexit is hard to determine.How will pensions, savings, investments and mortgages be affected?State pensions are set to continue increasing by at least the level of earnings, inflation or 2.5% every year - whichever is the highest, no matter what happens in the Brexit negotiations.There was an early post-referendum cut in interest rates, which has helped keep mortgage and other borrowing rates low.The reasonably strong performance of the UK economy, and the increase in inflation led to the Bank of England raising interest rates from 0.25% to 0.5% in November 2017 - the first increase in interest rates for 10 years - and then to 0.75% in August 2018.Interest rates going up generally makes it more expensive to pay back a mortgage or loan - but should be good news for savers as they should get amore interest on their money.Will duty-free sales on Europe journeys return?Image copyright Thinkstock There will be no immediate return of duty-free sales if the UK leaves the EU with a version of Theresa May's deal.That's because existing customs rules will continue to apply for the planned 21-month transition period.The possible return of duty-free could be part of negotiations on a future trade deal after December 2020.If the UK leaves without a deal, duty-free sales could return.LEGAL MATTERS Will leaving the EU mean the UK doesn't have to abide by the European Court of Human Rights?The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg is not a European Union institution.It was set up by the Council of Europe, which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.So quitting the EU will not exempt the UK from its decisions.The Conservatives are committed to sticking with the Human Rights Act which requires UK courts to treat the ECHR as setting legal precedents for the UK during the Brexit process.What about the European Court of Justice?The Court of Justice of the European Union - to give it its full name - is the EU's highest legal authority.It is based in Luxembourg.It is an entirely different thing to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).It is the European Court of Human Rights, not the ECJ that has often upset British politicians by making it harder, for example, to deport terrorist suspects.The ECJ interprets and enforces the rules of the single market, settling disputes between member countries over issues like free movement and trade.It is at the centre of pretty much everything the EU does and it having the power over UK actions has been a key issue for those arguing for the UK to leave to the EU to regain full sovereignty.Prime Minister Theresa May has vowed that Britain will not be under the "direct" jurisdiction of the ECJ after Brexit.But she has suggested that elements of relations could - where the UK signs up to specific EU agencies - still be covered by the ECJ after Brexit After that, there will need to be a new mechanism for settling disputes between the UK and the EU but what form that take has yet to be decided.There has been talk of an ombudsman, or some other third party, being appointed to settle disagreements.The version of the Brexit deal, published on 8 December 2017, do also give limited powers to the ECJ in terms of EU citizens living in the UK for up to eight years.The political declaration document makes clear that ECJ will continue to have a role on interpreting EU law after Brexit.JARGON BUSTER Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search What do 'soft' and 'hard' Brexit mean?These terms are used during debate on the terms of the UK's departure from the EU.There is no strict definition of either, but they are used to refer to the closeness of the UK's relationship with the EU post-Brexit.So at one extreme, "hard" Brexit could involve the UK refusing to compromise on issues like the free movement of people even if it meant leaving the single market or having to give up hopes of aspects of free trade arrangements.At the other end of the scale, a "soft" Brexit might follow a similar path to Norway, which is a member of the single market and has to accept the free movement of people as a result of that.Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Hard Brexit.Soft Brexit.No Deal.What does Brexit mean?What is the single market?The single market is seen by its advocates as the EU's biggest achievement and one of the main reasons it was set up in the first place.Britain was a member of a free trade area in Europe before it joined what was then known as the common market.In a free trade area countries can trade with each other without paying tariffs - but it is not a single market because the member states do not have to merge their economies together.The European Union single market, which was completed in 1992, allows the free movement of goods, services, money and people within the European Union, as if it was a single country.It is possible to set up a business or take a job anywhere within it.The idea was to boost trade, create jobs and lower prices.But it requires common law-making to ensure products are made to the same technical standards and imposes other rules to ensure a "level playing field".Critics say it generates too many petty regulations and robs members of control over their own affairs.Mass migration from poorer to richer countries has also raised questions about the free movement rule.Read more: A free trade area v EU single market What's the difference between the single market and the customs union?The customs union ensures EU member states all charge the same import duties to countries outside the EU.It allows member states to trade freely with each other, without burdensome customs checks at borders, but it limits their freedom to strike their own trade deals.It is different from a free trade area.In a free trade area no tariffs, taxes or quotas are charged on goods and services moving within the area but members are free to strike their own external trade deals.The government says the UK is leaving the customs union after the transition period but ministers have yet to decide on what will replace it.What is Article 50?Image copyright Thinkstock Article 50 is a plan for any country that wishes to exit the EU to do so.It was created as part of the Treaty of Lisbon - an agreement signed up to by all EU states which became law in 2009.Before that treaty, there was no formal mechanism for a country to leave the EU.It's pretty short - just five paragraphs THE POLITICAL SITUATION What changed in government after the 2016 referendum?Image copyright PA Britain got a new Prime Minister - Theresa May.The former home secretary took over from David Cameron, who announced he was resigning on the day he lost the referendum.She became PM without facing a full Conservative leadership contest after her key rivals from what had been the Leave side pulled out.How did the snap 2017 election change things?Image copyright Getty Images Theresa May surprised almost everyone after the 2017 Easter Bank Holiday by calling an election for 8 June (it had not been due until 2020).She said she wanted to strengthen her hand in Brexit negotiations with European leaders.She said Labour, the SNP and other opposition parties - and members of the House of Lords - would try to block and frustrate her strategy.However Mrs May did not increase her party's seats in the Commons and she ended up weakened, having to rely on support from the 10 MPs from Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party.You can get more detail on the 2017 election here.Has any other member state ever left the EU?No nation state has ever left the EU.But Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories, held a referendum in 1982, after gaining a greater degree of self government, and voted by 52% to 48% to leave, which it duly did after a period of negotiation.The BBC's Carolyn Quinn visited Greenland to find out how they did it.What does this mean for Scotland?Image copyright PA Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in the wake of the Leave result that it was "democratically unacceptable" that Scotland faced being taken out of the EU when it voted to Remain.She has called for an extension of the 21-month transition period to give the UK government more time to negotiate a compromise with opposition parties - and has officially asked for another referendum to be held, on the final Brexit deal.The SNP leader wants to stay in the customs union and single market after Brexit, describing it as the "least damaging" option for the UK economy as a whole - and has thrown her weight behind the campaign for another EU referendum.BREXIT NEGOTIATIONS They officially started a year after the referendum, on 19 June, 2017.Here's a picture from that first session: Image copyright Reuters The UK and EU negotiating teams met face-to-face for one week each month, with a few extra sessions also thrown in ahead of EU summits.Their first tasks were trying to get an agreement on the rights of UK and EU expat citizens after Brexit, reaching a figure for the amount of money the UK will need to pay on leaving, the so-called "divorce bill", and what happens to the Northern Ireland border.A provisional deal on these issues was reached on 8 December, 2017: 'Breakthrough' deal in Brexit talks.They then agreed terms for the "transition" phase and now have moved on to the permanent post-Brexit relationship, while trying to agree on the precise wording of the divorce issues.Who has been negotiating Britain's exit from the EU?Theresa May set up a government department, headed by veteran Conservative MP and Leave campaigner David Davis, to take responsibility for Brexit talks.Former defence secretary, Liam Fox, who also campaigned to leave the EU, was given the new job of international trade secretary and Boris Johnson, who was a leader of the official Leave campaign, was foreign secretary.These three were each playing roles in negotiations with the EU.However that has all changed now, with Boris Johnson and David Davis resigning over Theresa May's preferred Brexit plan.Dominic Raab took over as Brexit secretary - but resigned in November - and Jeremy Hunt is foreign secretary.Mrs May has made clear that she is in charge of the negotiations and the new Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay will not be getting heavily involved in the Brussels talks.Senior civil servant Olly Robbins has been the top EU official at the Brexit talks in Brussels.He started out at the top official at the Brexit department but was moved to the Cabinet Office to work directly for Theresa May, as the PM took more control over the process.Who's who guide to both sides' negotiators.THE REFERENDUM CAMPAIGN Who wanted the UK to leave the EU?The UK Independence Party, which received nearly four million votes - 13% of those cast - in the 2015 general election, but who saw their vote collapse to about a quarter of that at this year's election, has campaigned for many years for Britain's exit from the EU.They were joined in their call during the referendum campaign by about half the Conservative Party's MPs, including Boris Johnson and five members of the then Cabinet.A handful of Labour MPs and Northern Ireland party the DUP were also in favour of leaving.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to leave?They said Britain was being held back by the EU, which they said imposed too many rules on business and charged billions of pounds a year in membership fees for little in return.They also wanted the UK to make all of its own laws again, rather than being created through shared decision making with other EU nations.Immigration was also a big issue for Brexit supporters, They wanted Britain to take back full control of its borders and reduce the number of people coming here to live and/or work.One of the main principles of EU membership is "free movement", which means you don't need to get a visa to go and live in another EU country.The Leave campaign also objected to the idea of "ever closer union" between EU member states and what they see as moves towards the creation of a "United States of Europe".Who wanted the UK to stay in the EU?Then Prime Minister David Cameron was the leading voice in the Remain campaign, after reaching an agreement with other European Union leaders that would have changed the terms of Britain's membership had the country voted to stay in.He said the deal would give Britain "special" status and help sort out some of the things British people said they didn't like about the EU, like high levels of immigration - but critics said the deal would make little difference.Sixteen members of Mr Cameron's Cabinet, including the woman who would replace him as PM, Theresa May, also backed staying in.The Conservative Party was split on the issue and officially remained neutral in the campaign.The Labour Party, Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats were all in favour of staying in.The then US president Barack Obama also wanted Britain to remain in the EU - unlike his successor, Donald Trump, who is an enthusiastic champion of Brexit - as did the leaders of other EU nations such as France and Germany.What were their reasons for wanting the UK to stay?Those campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU said it got a big boost from membership - it makes selling things to other EU countries easier and, they argued, the flow of immigrants, most of whom are young and keen to work, fuels economic growth and helps pay for public services.They also said Britain's status in the world would be damaged by leaving and that we are more secure as part of the 28 nation club, rather than going it alone.What about businesses?Big business - with a few exceptions - tended to be in favour of Britain staying in the EU because it makes it easier for them to move money, people and products around the world.Given the crucial role of London as a financial centre, there's interest in how many jobs may be lost to other hubs in the EU.Some UK exporters say they've had increased orders or enquiries because of the fall in the value of the pound.Others are less optimistic, fearing products for the European market may have to be made at plants in the EU.Image copyright Reuters Image caption Boris Johnson was one of the most prominent Leave campaigners Who led the rival sides in the referendum campaign?Britain Stronger in Europe - the main cross-party group campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU was headed by former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose.It was backed by key figures from the Conservative Party, including Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, most Labour MPs, including party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Alan Johnson, who ran the Labour In for Britain campaign, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, the Alliance party and the SDLP in Northern Ireland, and the Green Party.Who funded the campaign: Britain Stronger in Europe raised 12.1m, including two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to remain : The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Britain Stronger in Europe raised 12.1m, including two donations totalling 2.3m from the supermarket magnate and Labour peer Lord Sainsbury.Other prominent Remain donors included hedge fund manager David Harding (750,000), businessman and Travelex founder Lloyd Dorfman (500,000) and the Tower Limited Partnership (500,000).Read a Who's Who guide.: The SNP ran its own remain campaign in Scotland as it did not want to share a platform with the Conservatives.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Vote Leave - A cross-party campaign that had the backing of senior Conservatives such as Michael Gove and Boris Johnson plus a handful of Labour MPs, including Gisela Stuart and Graham Stringer, and UKIP's Douglas Carswell and Suzanne Evans, and the DUP in Northern Ireland.Former Tory chancellor Lord Lawson and SDP founder Lord Owen were also involved.It had a string of affiliated groups such as Farmers for Britain, Muslims for Britain and Out and Proud, a gay anti-EU group, aimed at building support in different communities.Who funded the campaign: Vote Leave raised 9.8m.Among its supporters was businessman Patrick Barbour, who gave 500,000.Former Conservative Party treasurer Peter Cruddas gave a 350,000 donation and construction mogul Terence Adams handed over 300,000.Read a Who's Who guide.Who else campaigned to leave: UKIP leader Nigel Farage was not part of Vote Leave.His party ran its own campaign and was involved in Leave.EU, a campaign run by former UKIP donor Arron Banks, which raised a total of 3.2m.The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also ran its own out campaign.Several smaller groups also registered to campaign.Here are a selection of questions sent in - you can ask yours via the form at the end of this page Which MPs were for staying and which for leaving?The good news for Edward, from Cambridge, who asked this question, is we have been working on exactly such a list.Click here for the latest version.How much does the UK contribute to the EU and how much do we get in return?In answer to this query from Nancy from Hornchurch - the UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out.Only France and Germany contribute more.In 2014/15, Poland was the largest beneficiary, followed by Hungary and Greece.Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The UK is one of 10 member states who pay more into the EU budget than they get out The UK also gets an annual rebate that was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher and money back, in the form of regional development grants and payments to farmers, which added up to 4.6bn in 2014/15.According to the latest Treasury figures, the UK's net contribution for 2014/15 was 8.8bn - nearly double what it was in 2009/10.The National Audit Office, using a different formula which takes into account EU money paid directly to private sector companies and universities to fund research, and measured over the EU's financial year, shows the UK's net contribution for 2014 was 5.7bn.Read more number crunching from Reality Check.What will happen to protected species?Dee, from Launceston, wanted to know what would happen to EU laws covering protected species such as bats in the event of Britain leaving the EU.As already mentioned the plan is for all EU laws to be transferred into UK law as part of the EU (withdrawal) Bill.That means the government then has time to decide what laws to keep, scrap or change without the risk of a legal black hole on the first day after Brexit.The status of Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas, which are designated by the EU, would be reviewed to see what alternative protections could be applied.The same process would apply to European Protected Species legislation, which relate to bats and their habitats.The issue has been a hot one and Environment Secretary Michael Gove has insisted that the UK will maintain or enhance its environmental laws.Will we be barred from the Eurovision Song Contest?Image copyright BBC/Guy Levy Image caption To participate in the Eurovision Song Contest countries need to be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, which is independent of the EU Sophie from Peterborough, who asks the question, need not worry.We have consulted Alasdair Rendall, president of the UK Eurovision fan club, who says: "All participating countries must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union.The EBU - which is totally independent of the EU - includes countries both inside and outside of the EU, and also includes countries such as Israel that are outside of Europe.Indeed the UK started participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in 1957, 16 years before joining the then EEC."What will happen to pet passports?The answer to Alan's question, the European Commission says, is that pet passports will, like everything else, depend on whether the UK leaves with a deal or not.The UK introduced the pet passport scheme in 2000, replacing the previous quarantine laws.It means you and your dog, cat or ferret can travel between the UK and the EU (and other participating countries) as long as it has a passport, a microchip and has been vaccinated against rabies.If the UK leaves with a deal, this will not change.If there's no deal, pet passports issued in the UK would not be valid for travel to the EU.Pet owners planning to travel with their animals, would need to get them microchipped and vaccinated against rabies.Further details are on the government website.What is the 'red tape' that opponents of the EU complain about?Ged, from Liverpool, suspects "red tape" is a euphemism for employment rights and environmental protection.According to the Open Europe think tank, four of the top five most costly EU regulations are either employment or environment-related.The UK renewable energy strategy, which the think-tank says costs 4.7bn a year, tops the list.The working time directive (4.2bn a year) - which limits the working week to 48 hours - and the temporary agency workers directive (2.1bn a year), giving temporary staff many of the same rights as permanent ones - are also on the list.Most of the EU-derived laws on the UK's statute books will be copied across into UK law so that businesses can continue to function on the day Britain leaves the EU, in March 2019.Future governments will then be able to amend or scrap them.Brexit may also generate "red tape" of its own - if the UK leaves the single market and the customs union, businesses could face more paperwork as they cross borders into EU countries.Will Britain be party to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership?Ste, in Bolton, asked about this.The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - or TTIP - currently under negotiation between the EU and United States would create the biggest free trade area the world has ever seen.Cheerleaders for TTIP, including former PM David Cameron, believed it could make American imports cheaper and boost British exports to the US to the tune of 10bn a year.But many on the left, including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, feared it would shift more power to multinational corporations, undermine public services, wreck food standards and threaten basic rights.This debate now appears academic as US President Donald Trump is not a fan of the agreement, which means it has been shelved in its previous form - but whatever happens, when the UK quits the EU it would no longer be part of a revived TTIP and is planning to negotiate its own trade deal with the US.What impact will leaving the EU have on the NHS?Paddy, from Widnes, wanted to know how leaving the EU will affect the number of doctors we have and impact the NHS.This became an issue in the referendum debate after the Leave campaign claimed the money Britain sends to the EU, which it claimed was 350m a week, could be spent on the NHS instead.The BBC's Reality Check team looked into this claim.Before the vote the then Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that leaving the EU would lead to budget cuts and an exodus of overseas doctors and nurses.The Leave campaign dismissed his intervention as "scaremongering" and insisted that EU membership fees could be spent on domestic services like the NHS.Since the referendum there has been a relaxation of the immigration rules for doctors from outside the EU and an increase in the planned number of "home grown" doctors qualifying through new medical schools.But according to Personnel Today there were fewer EU nationals moving to work in the NHS, and an increase in the number quitting.Spending on the NHS has continued at the same level as planned before the referendum, although Theresa May said in June 2018 that a "Brexit dividend" was helping fund a larger-than-planned 20bn increase in NHS spending in England by 2023.Adrian runs a small electronics company and wants to know about export tariffs after Brexit As long as Britain has been in the EU we haven't really talked much about tariffs.That's because all trade within the European Economic Area is tariff-free.On top of that the EU has trade agreements with 52 other countries as well.After Brexit, Britain is going to have to negotiate new deals all on its own.That's both a problem and an opportunity.For example you can use tariffs against foreign imports to protect businesses you care about, as the EU does with agricultural produce, but you do then run the risk of retaliation from your trading partners.The key body in all of this is the World Trade Organisation and at the moment the UK is only a member via its membership of the EU.The UK will automatically become a member in its own right as soon as it leaves the EU.The principle of non-discrimination means that WTO members must not treat any member less advantageously than any other.In practice, this should prevent the EU introducing tariffs on the UK which would discriminate against us, or the UK introducing similar tariffs on the EU.Non-food items imported into the EU currently have a tariff of about 2,3%.Cars have a 10% tariff - but if the EU were to impose a 10% tariff on UK car imports, then the UK could impose the same tariff on German and French cars.The two sides would want to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war.They are hoping to strike a broad agreement on trading terms by December 2020, which would include a "free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas".The UK will also need to reach agreements with other nations around the world.Image copyright Thinkstock What impact will leaving have on the UK's long term political influence in Europe In reply to Peter - there are basically two views on what will happen in terms of clout when outside the EU.View one is that the UK projects power and influence in the world, working through organisations such as the EU and that on our own it'll be a much diminished force.View two is that unencumbered by the other 27 members, the UK can get on with things and start adopting a much more independent, self-confident, assertive role on the world stage.Image copyright Getty Images How will access to healthcare change for expats living in the EU Veronique, who lives in Italy asked this one.After Brexit, there will be two possibilities.If the UK leaves the EU without a deal, the situation will depend on the individual country where you live.For the Bradleys in Italy, for example, residents from non-EU countries, and that will soon include the Brits, will have to finalise their residency status, acquire an Italian identity card and then apply for an Italian health insurance card.If they visit the UK at the moment, access to the NHS for non-resident Brits is not straightforward unless you have a European health insurance card.The right to treatment is based on residency, not on your tax status.So, even if you live abroad and pay some British tax on a buy-to-let property for instance, you might find yourself getting a bill for any NHS treatment you end up getting while you are back in the UK.What will happen to EU nationals with a British state pension Peter, a German citizen living in the UK asked this question, and the good news is that if you are an EU national and you get a British state pension, nothing much should change, because the state pension is dependent not on where you come from, but on how long you have paid National Insurance contributions in the UK.So it doesn't matter whether you come from Lithuania or Latvia or Transylvania or Timbuktu, what counts is how much you have paid in terms of National Insurance contributions.There is one wrinkle though and that is that you have to have paid in for at least 10 years.Image copyright Getty Images Under the current rules, if you are an EU citizen and haven't paid in for 10 years, you can point to any contributions you have made in your native country and say, "I paid in there", and that will count.That works for EU countries and another 16 countries with which the UK has social security agreements.Once we have left the EU, you will no longer be able to do that unless we negotiate new reciprocal agreements.If we don't then potentially, if you have paid in fewer than than 10 years' worth of National Insurance contributions, you will not get a British state pension.Is it possible to be both an EU citizen and not an EU citizen Anyone born in Northern Ireland has an absolute right to carry both passports.Declan, an Irish passport holder, might be happy to know that this is one of the few questions where I can't see a downside as long as you are happy and comfortable carrying both passports.Image copyright Getty Images The Irish document means you continue to enjoy the benefits of EU citizenship, and the British passport will give you full rights in the UK at the same time.Call it one of the clear joys of coming from Northern Ireland, alongside the rolling hills, rugged coastline and enjoyable breaks between the showers.All you have to do is remember to carry the Irish passport when you are joining the EU citizens-only queue at the airport in future.
Brexit: Jargon-busting guide to the key terms:::::Confused by all the Brexit jargon in the news?Here's a glossary to demystify commonly used EU-related terms.Please upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Use the list below or select a button 12 key terms No deal A no-deal Brexit would mean the UK leaving the European Union and cutting ties immediately, with no agreement at all in place.If MPs do not approve Theresa May's deal, and there is no alternative deal or move to delay or stop Brexit, the UK will leave with no deal.The UK would follow World Trade Organization rules to trade with the EU and other countries, while trying to negotiate free-trade deals.WTO rules If countries don't have free-trade agreements, they usually trade with each other under rules set by the World Trade Organization.Each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering.For example, cars passing from non-EU countries to the EU are charged 10% of their value.But tariffs on some agricultural products are much higher - dairy averages more than 35%.If the UK chooses to put no tariffs on goods from the EU, it must also have no tariffs on goods from every WTO member.Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean?(August 2018) Transition period If Theresa May's deal was accepted, this period would last 21 months from Brexit day, on 29 March 2019, to 31 December 2020.It could be extended by up to two years if both the UK and the EU wanted.The transition is intended to allow time for the UK and EU to agree their future relationship.The UK would have no say in the making of new EU laws during the transition but would have to follow all EU rules, including freedom of movement.Article 50 Part of an EU treaty that sets out how member countries can leave, with a two-year timetable for leaving.Article 50 was triggered by Prime Minister Theresa May at the end of March 2017 and means the UK will leave the EU at the end of March 2019.The UK is allowed to stop the Article 50 process completely - but if it wants only to extend it, all the other EU countries must agree.Another referendum Some campaigners - who call their proposal the People's Vote - want to have another referendum on the UK's membership of the EU.It has been suggested the vote could have three options - Theresa May's deal, no deal and Remain.But some campaigners think there should only be two choices.Opponents of another vote say there is no need for it as the 2016 referendum made it clear that people wanted to leave the EU.How could another Brexit referendum work?(December 2018) Single market A system that enables goods, services, people and capital (money) to move between all 28 EU member states, as well as Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.Countries in the single market apply many common rules and standards.A UK company can sell its product (goods) in Portugal as easily as it can in Portsmouth, bring back the cash (capital), offer maintenance (services) and despatch a repair team (people).Brexit Basics: The single market explained (December 2018) Customs union A trade agreement under which two or more countries do not put tariffs (taxes) on goods coming in from other countries in the union.The countries also decide to set the same tariff on goods entering from outside the union.The EU customs union includes EU member states and some small non-EU members and forbids members from negotiating trade agreements separately from the EU.Instead trade agreements are negotiated collectively.Brexits Basics: The customs union explained (November 2018) Free-trade agreement A deal between countries to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, trade barriers.These barriers include import or export taxes (tariffs), quotas or licences that limit imports, and differing regulations on things such as safety or hygiene or labelling.The aim is increase trade in goods but also services.Brexit Basics: Free trade agreements explained (November 2018) Withdrawal agreement Theresa May has agreed a deal with the EU on the terms of the UK's departure.It does not determine the UK-EU future relationship.It does include how much money the UK must pay to the EU as a settlement, details of the transition period, and citizens' rights.It also covers the so-called "backstop", which ensures that no hard border exists between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit even if there's no deal on the future relationship in place by the end of the transition period.The withdrawal agreement - what it all means (November 2018) Backstop Currently, there are no border posts, physical barriers or checks on people or goods crossing the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.The backstop is a measure in the withdrawal agreement designed to ensure that continues after the UK leaves the EU.It comes into effect only if the deal deciding the future relationship between the UK and EU is not agreed by the end of the transition period (31 December 2020).Until the deal on the future relationship is done, the backstop would keep the UK effectively inside the EU's customs union but with Northern Ireland also conforming to some rules of the single market.Critics say a different status for Northern Ireland could threaten the existence of the United Kingdom and fear that the backstop could become permanent.Brexit Basics: What is the backstop?Free movement One of the four freedoms associated with the single market is free movement of people.This lets EU citizens travel, live, study and work in any member country.There can be no discrimination in access to public services and benefits.Divorce bill The money the UK has agreed to pay to the EU under Theresa May's deal.Based on UK's share of EU budgets up to 2020 as well as continuing liabilities such as EU civil servants' pensions The bill is widely expected to be about 39bn and will be paid over a number of years, with about half of it during the transition.More on Brexit: Brexit: All you need to know Brexit timeline: Leaving the EU
